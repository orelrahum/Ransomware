    In 1990, in spite of large mineral resources Zaire had a GDP per capita of
    only about $260, putting it among the desperately poor African nations. The
    country's chronic economic problems worsened in 1991, with copper and cobalt
    production down 20-30%, inflation near 8,000% in 1991 as compared with 100%
    in 1987-89, and IMF and most World Bank support suspended until the
    institution of agreed-on changes. Agriculture, a key sector of the economy,
    employs 75% of the population but generates under 25% of GDP. The main
    potential for economic development has been the extractive industries.
    Mining and mineral processing account for about one-third of GDP and
    three-quarters of total export earnings. Zaire is the world's largest
    producer of diamonds and cobalt.
