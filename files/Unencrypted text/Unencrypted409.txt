:Mexico Economy

Overview:
    Mexico's economy is a mixture of state-owned industrial plants (notably
    oil), private manufacturing and services, and both large-scale and
    traditional agriculture. In the 1980s, Mexico experienced severe economic
    difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as world petroleum
    prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the domestic food supply;
    and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate became more acute.
    Growth in national output, however, is recovering, rising from 1.4% in 1988
    to 4% in 1990 and again in 1991. The US is Mexico's major trading partner,
    accounting for two-thirds of its exports and imports. After petroleum,
    border assembly plants and tourism are the largest earners of foreign
    exchange. The government, in consultation with international economic
    agencies, is implementing programs to stabilize the economy and foster
    growth. In 1991 the government began negotiations with the US and Canada on
    a free trade agreement.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $289 billion, per capita $3,200; real growth rate
    4% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    18.8% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    14-17% (1991 est.)
Budget:
    revenues $41.0 billion; expenditures $47.9 billion, including capital
    expenditures of $6.3 billion (1990)
Exports:
    $27.4 billion (f.o.b., 1991 est.)
