:Bolivia Economy

Overview:
    The Bolivian economy steadily deteriorated between 1980 and 1985 as La Paz
    financed growing budget deficits by expanding the money supply, and
    inflation spiraled - peaking at 11,700%. An austere orthodox economic
    program adopted by then President Paz Estenssoro in 1985, however, succeeded
    in reducing inflation to between 10% and 20% annually since 1987, eventually
    restarting economic growth. Since August 1989, President Paz Zamora has
    retained the economic policies of the previous government, keeping inflation
    down and continuing moderate growth. Nevertheless, Bolivia continues to be
    one of the poorest countries in Latin America, with widespread poverty and
    unemployment, and it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations for its
    limited exports - agricultural products, minerals, and natural gas.
    Moreover, for many farmers, who constitute half of the country's work force,
    the main cash crop is coca, which is sold for cocaine processing.
