:United Arab Emirates Economy

Overview:
    The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's highest incomes per
    capita outside the OECD nations. This wealth is based on oil and gas, and
    the fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities.
    Since 1973, when petroleum prices shot up, the UAE has undergone a profound
    transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to
    a modern state with a high standard of living. At present levels of
    production, crude oil reserves should last for over 100 years.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $33.7 billion, per capita $14,100 (1990); real
    growth rate 11% (1989)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    5.5% (1990 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    NEGL (1988)
Budget:
    revenues $3.8 billion; expenditures $3.7 billion, including capital
    expenditures of $NA (1989 est.)
