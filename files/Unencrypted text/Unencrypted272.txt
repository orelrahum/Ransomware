:Dominican Republic Economy

Overview:
    The economy is largely dependent on trade; imported components average 60%
    of the value of goods consumed in the domestic market. Rapid growth of free
    trade zones has established a significant expansion of manufacturing for
    export, especially wearing apparel. Over the past decade, tourism has also
    increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign exchange and a
    source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. The
    principal commercial crop is sugarcane, followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa,
    and tobacco. Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural
    products, durable consumer goods, minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is
    officially reported at about 30%, but there is considerable underemployment.
    A fiscal austerity program has brought inflation under control, but in 1991
    the economy contracted for a second straight year.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $7 billion, per capita $950; real growth rate -2%
    (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    9% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    30% (1991 est.)
Budget:
    revenues NA; expenditures $1.1 billion, including capital expenditures of NA
    (1992 est.)
