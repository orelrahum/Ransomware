the work of one group of chemistry students using traditional printed
texts and two groups using electronic sources  The experiment
demonstrated that in the event one does not know what to read one needs
the electronic systems the electronic systems hold no advantage at the
moment if one knows what to read but neither do they impose a penalty

DALY provided an anecdotal account of the revolutionizing impact of the
new technology on his previous methods of research in the field of classics
His account by extrapolation served to illustrate in part the arguments
made by MICHELSON concerning the positive effects of the sudden and radical
transformation being wrought in the ways scholars work

Susan VECCIA and Joanne FREEMAN delineated the use of electronic
materials outside the university  The most interesting aspect of their
use FREEMAN said could be seen as a paradox  teachers in elementary
and secondary schools requested access to primary source materials but
at the same time found that "primariness" itself made these materials
difficult for their students to use


OTHER TOPICS

Marybeth PETERS reviewed copyright law in the United States and offered
advice during a lively discussion of this subject  But uncertainty
remains concerning the price of copyright in a digital medium because a
solution remains to be worked out concerning management and synthesis of
copyrighted and outofcopyright pieces of a database

As moderator of the final session of the Workshop Prosser GIFFORD directed
discussion to future courses of action and the potential role of LC in
advancing them  Among the recommendations that emerged were the following

      Workshop participants should  begin to think about working
     with image material but structure and digitize it in such a
     way that at a later stage it can be interpreted into text and
      find a common way to build text and images together so that
     they can be used jointly at some stage in the future with
     appropriate network support because that is how users will want
     to access these materials  The Library might encourage attempts
     to bring together people who are working on texts and images

      A network version of American Memory should be developed or
     consideration should be given to making the data in it
     available to people interested in doing network multimedia
     Given the current dearth of digital data that is appealing and
     unencumbered by extremely complex rights problems developing a
     network version of American Memory could do much to help make
     network multimedia a reality

      Concerning the thorny issue of electronic deposit LC should
     initiate a catalytic process in terms of distributed
     responsibility that is bring together the distributed
     organizations and set up a study group to look at all the
     issues related to electronic deposit and see where we as a
     nation should move  For example LC might attempt to persuade
     one major library in each state to deal with its state
     equivalent publisher which might produce a cooperative project
     that would be equitably distributed around the country and one
     in which LC would be dealing with a minimal number of publishers
     and minimal copyright problems  LC must also deal with the
     concept of online publishing determining among other things
     how serials such as OJCCT might be deposited for copyright

      Since a number of projects are planning to carry out
     preservation by creating digital images that will end up in
     online or nearline storage at some institution LC might play
     a helpful role at least in the near term by accelerating how
     to catalog that information into the Research Library Information
     Network RLIN and then into OCLC so that it would be accessible
     This would reduce the possibility of multiple institutions digitizing
     the same work


CONCLUSION

The Workshop was valuable because it brought together partisans from
various groups and provided an occasion to compare goals and methods
The more committed partisans frequently communicate with others in their
groups but less often across group boundaries  The Workshop was also
valuable to attendeesincluding those involved with American Memorywho
came less committed to particular approaches or concepts  These
attendees learned a great deal and plan to select and employ elements of
imaging textcoding and networked distribution that suit their
respective projects and purposes

Still reality rears its ugly head  no breakthrough has been achieved
On the imaging side one confronts a proliferation of competing
datainterchange standards and a lack of consensus on the role of digital
facsimiles in preservation  In the realm of machinereadable texts one
encounters a reasonably mature standard but methodological difficulties
and high costs  These latter problems of course represent a special
impediment to the desire as it is sometimes expressed in the popular
press "to put the contents of the Library of Congress on line"  In
the words of one participant there was "no solution to the economic
problemsthe projects that are out there are surviving but it is going
to be a lot of work to transform the information industry and so far the
investment to do that is not forthcoming" LESK per litteras

GIFFORD  Origin of Workshop in current Librarians desire to make LCs
collections more widely available  Desiderata arising from the prospect
of greater interconnectedness 


After welcoming participants on behalf of the Library of Congress
American Memory AM and the National Demonstration Lab Prosser
GIFFORD director for scholarly programs Library of Congress located
the origin of the Workshop on Electronic Texts in a conversation he had
had considerably more than a year ago with Carl FLEISCHHAUER concerning
some of the issues faced by AM  On the assumption that numerous other
people were asking the same questions the decision was made to bring
together as many of these people as possible to ask the same questions
together  In a deeper sense GIFFORD said the origin of the Workshop
lay in the desire of the current Librarian of Congress James H
Billington to make the collections of the Library especially those
offering unique or unusual testimony on aspects of the American
experience available to a much wider circle of users than those few
people who can come to Washington to use them  This meant that the
emphasis of AM from the outset has been on archival collections of the
basic material and on making these collections themselves available
rather than selected or heavily edited products

From AMs emphasis followed the questions with which the Workshop began
who will use these materials and in what form will they wish to use
