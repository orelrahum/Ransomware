    government also was under financial constraints Iraqs seizure of Kuwait
    in August  subsequent international economic embargoes and military
    actions by an international coalition beginning in January  drastically
    changed the economic picture Oil exports were cut to near zero and
    industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged Throughout

    increase prices for most goods The governments policy to allocate goods to
    key supporters of the regime exacerbated shortages
