Sao Tome and Principe Economy

Overview
    The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
    independence nearly  years ago Since then however cocoa production has
    gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement so that by 
    output had fallen to less than  of its former levels As a result a
    shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balanceofpayments
    problem Production of less important crops such as coffee copra and palm
    kernels has also declined The value of imports generally exceeds that of
    exports by a ratio of  The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
    of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import  of food needs
    It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods Over the years
    Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt which amounts to
    roughly  of export earnings Considerable potential exists for
    development of a tourist industry and the government has taken steps to
    expand facilities in recent years The government also implemented a
    FiveYear Plan covering  to restructure the economy and reschedule
    external debt service payments in cooperation with the International
    Development Association and Western lenders

Serbia and Montenegro Economy

Overview
    The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been accompanied by bloody
    ethnic warfare the destabilization of republic boundaries and the breakup
    of important interrepublic trade flows The situation in Serbia and
    Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military
    strife This new state faces major economic problems First like the other
    former Yugoslav republics Serbia and Montenegro depended on their sister
    republics for large amounts of foodstuffs energy supplies and
    manufactures Wide varieties in climate mineral resources and levels of
    technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence as did
    the Communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
    number of giant plants The breakup of many of the trade links the sharp
    drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets and the
    destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the
    economic difficulties of the republics One singular factor in the economic
    situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a
    Communist government that is primarily interested in political and military
    mastery not economic reform A further complication is the major economic
    sanctions by the leading industrial nations
