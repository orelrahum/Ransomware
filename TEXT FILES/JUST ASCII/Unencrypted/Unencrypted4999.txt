And with the majesty of darkness round
Covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar
Mustering their rage and Heaven resembles Hell
As he our darkness cannot we his light
Imitate when we please? This desert soil
Wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold
Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
Magnificence and what can Heaven show more?
Our torments also may in length of time
Become our elements these piercing fires
As soft as now severe our temper changed
Into their temper which must needs remove
The sensible of pain All things invite
To peaceful counsels and the settled state
Of order how in safety best we may
Compose our present evils with regard
Of what we are and where dismissing quite
All thoughts of war Ye have what I advise"
  He scarce had finished when such murmur filled
Th assembly as when hollow rocks retain
The sound of blustering winds which all night long
Had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull
Seafaring men oerwatched whose bark by chance
Or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay
After the tempest Such applause was heard
As Mammon ended and his sentence pleased
Advising peace for such another field
They dreaded worse than Hell so much the fear
Of thunder and the sword of Michael
Wrought still within them and no less desire
To found this nether empire which might rise
By policy and long process of time
In emulation opposite to Heaven
Which when Beelzebub perceivedthan whom
Satan except none higher satwith grave
Aspect he rose and in his rising seemed
A pillar of state Deep on his front engraven
Deliberation sat and public care
And princely counsel in his face yet shone
Majestic though in ruin Sage he stood
With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear
The weight of mightiest monarchies his look
Drew audience and attention still as night
Or summers noontide air while thus he spake
  "Thrones and Imperial Powers Offspring of Heaven
Ethereal Virtues or these titles now
Must we renounce and changing style be called
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote
Inclineshere to continue and build up here
A growing empire doubtless while we dream
And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed
This place our dungeon not our safe retreat
Beyond his potent arm to live exempt
From Heavens high jurisdiction in new league
Banded against his throne but to remain
In strictest bondage though thus far removed
Under th inevitable curb reserved
His captive multitude For he to be sure
In height or depth still first and last will reign
Sole king and of his kingdom lose no part
By our revolt but over Hell extend
His empire and with iron sceptre rule
Us here as with his golden those in Heaven
What sit we then projecting peace and war?
War hath determined us and foiled with loss
Irreparable terms of peace yet none
Vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given
To us enslaved but custody severe
And stripes and arbitrary punishment
Inflicted? and what peace can we return
But to our power hostility and hate
Untamed reluctance and revenge though slow
Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least
May reap his conquest and may least rejoice
In doing what we most in suffering feel?
Nor will occasion want nor shall we need
With dangerous expedition to invade
Heaven whose high walls fear no assault or siege
Or ambush from the Deep What if we find
Some easier enterprise? There is a place
If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven
Err notanother World the happy seat
Of some new race called Man about this time
To be created like to us though less
In power and excellence but favoured more
Of him who rules above so was his will
Pronounced among the Gods and by an oath
That shook Heavens whole circumference confirmed
Thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn
What creatures there inhabit of what mould
Or substance how endued and what their power
And where their weakness how attempted best
By force of subtlety Though Heaven be shut
And Heavens high Arbitrator sit secure
In his own strength this place may lie exposed
The utmost border of his kingdom left
To their defence who hold it here perhaps
Some advantageous act may be achieved
By sudden onseteither with Hellfire
To waste his whole creation or possess
All as our own and drive as we were driven
The puny habitants or if not drive
Seduce them to our party that their God
May prove their foe and with repenting hand
Abolish his own works This would surpass
Common revenge and interrupt his joy
In our confusion and our joy upraise
In his disturbance when his darling sons
Hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse
Their frail original and faded bliss
Faded so soon Advise if this be worth
Attempting or to sit in darkness here
Hatching vain empires" Thus beelzebub
Pleaded his devilish counselfirst devised
By Satan and in part proposed for whence
But from the author of all ill could spring
So deep a malice to confound the race
Of mankind in one root and Earth with Hell
To mingle and involve done all to spite
The great Creator? But their spite still serves
His glory to augment The bold design
Pleased highly those infernal States and joy
Sparkled in all their eyes with full assent
They vote whereat his speech he thus renews
"Well have ye judged well ended long debate
Synod of Gods and like to what ye are
Great things resolved which from the lowest deep
Will once more lift us up in spite of fate
Nearer our ancient seatperhaps in view
Of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms
And opportune excursion we may chance
Reenter Heaven or else in some mild zone
Dwell not unvisited of Heavens fair light
Secure and at the brightening orient beam
Purge off this gloom the soft delicious air
To heal the scar of these corrosive fires
Shall breathe her balm But first whom shall we send
In search of this new World? whom shall we find
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet
The dark unbottomed infinite Abyss
And through the palpable obscure find out
His uncouth way or spread his airy flight
Upborne with indefatigable wings
Over the vast abrupt ere he arrive
The happy Isle? What strength what art can then
Suffice or what evasion bear him safe
Through the strict senteries and stations thick
Of Angels watching round? Here he had need
All circumspection and we now no less
Choice in our suffrage for on whom we send
The weight of all and our last hope relies"
  This said he sat and expectation held
His look suspense awaiting who appeared
To second or oppose or undertake
The perilous attempt But all sat mute
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each
In others countenance read his own dismay
Astonished None among the choice and prime
Of those Heavenwarring champions could be found
So hardy as to proffer or accept
Alone the dreadful voyage till at last
Satan whom now transcendent glory raised
Above his fellows with monarchal pride
Conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake
  "O Progeny of Heaven Empyreal Thrones
With reason hath deep silence and demur
Seized us though undismayed Long is the way
And hard that out of Hell leads up to light
Our prison strong this huge convex of fire
Outrageous to devour immures us round
Ninefold and gates of burning adamant
Barred over us prohibit all egress
These passed if any pass the void profound
Of unessential Night receives him next
Widegaping and with utter loss of being
Threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf
If thence he scape into whatever world
Or unknown region what remains him less
Than unknown dangers and as hard escape?
But I should ill become this throne O Peers
And this imperial sovereignty adorned
With splendour armed with power if aught proposed
And judged of public moment in the shape
Of difficulty or danger could deter
Me from attempting Wherefore do I assume
These royalties and not refuse to reign
Refusing to accept as great a share
Of hazard as of honour due alike
To him who reigns and so much to him due
Of hazard more as he above the rest
High honoured sits? Go therefore mighty Powers
Terror of Heaven though fallen intend at home
While here shall be our home what best may ease
The present misery and render Hell
More tolerable if there be cure or charm
To respite or deceive or slack the pain
Of this ill mansion intermit no watch
Against a wakeful foe while I abroad
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek
Deliverance for us all This enterprise
None shall partake with me" Thus saying rose
The Monarch and prevented all reply
Prudent lest from his resolution raised
Others among the chief might offer now
Certain to be refused what erst they feared
And so refused might in opinion stand
His rivals winning cheap the high repute
Which he through hazard huge must earn But they
Dreaded not more th adventure than his voice
Forbidding and at once with him they rose
Their rising all at once was as the sound
Of thunder heard remote Towards him they bend
With awful reverence prone and as a God
Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven
Nor failed they to express how much they praised
That for the general safety he despised
His own for neither do the Spirits damned
Lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast
Their specious deeds on earth which glory excites
Or close ambition varnished oer with zeal
  Thus they their doubtful consultations dark
Ended rejoicing in their matchless Chief
As when from mountaintops the dusky clouds
Ascending while the north wind sleeps oerspread
Heavens cheerful face the louring element
Scowls oer the darkened landscape snow or shower
If chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet
Extend his evening beam the fields revive
The birds their notes renew and bleating herds
Attest their joy that hill and valley rings
O shame to men Devil with devil damned
Firm concord holds men only disagree
Of creatures rational though under hope
Of heavenly grace and God proclaiming peace
Yet live in hatred enmity and strife
Among themselves and levy cruel wars
Wasting the earth each other to destroy
As if which might induce us to accord
Man had not hellish foes enow besides
That day and night for his destruction wait
  The Stygian council thus dissolved and forth
In order came the grand infernal Peers
Midst came their mighty Paramount and seemed
Alone th antagonist of Heaven nor less
Than Hells dread Emperor with pomp supreme
And godlike imitated state him round
A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed
With bright emblazonry and horrent arms
Then of their session ended they bid cry
With trumpets regal sound the great result
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy
By heralds voice explained the hollow Abyss
Heard far adn wide and all the host of Hell
With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim
Thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised
By false presumptuous hope the ranged Powers
Disband and wandering each his several way
Pursues as inclination or sad choice
Leads him perplexed where he may likeliest find
Truce to his restless thoughts and entertain
The irksome hours till his great Chief return
Part on the plain or in the air sublime
Upon the wing or in swift race contend
