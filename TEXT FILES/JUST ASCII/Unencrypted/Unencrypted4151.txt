	Did make offence his eye did heal it up
	He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall
	His leg is but so so and yet tis well
	There was a pretty redness in his lip
	A little riper and more lusty red
	Than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference
	Between the constant red and mingled damask
	There be some women Silvius had they markd him
	In parcels as I did would have gone near
	To fall in love with him but for my part
	I love him not nor hate him not and yet
	I have more cause to hate him than to love him
	For what had he to do to chide at me?
	He said mine eyes were black and my hair black
	And now I am rememberd scornd at me
	I marvel why I answerd not again
	But thats all one omittance is no quittance
	Ill write to him a very taunting letter
	And thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius?

SILVIUS	Phebe with all my heart
