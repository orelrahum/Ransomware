Reunion Economy

Overview
    The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture Sugarcane has been
    the primary crop for more than a century and in some years it accounts for
     of exports The government has been pushing the development of a tourist
    industry to relieve high unemployment which recently amounted to onethird
    of the labor force The gap in Reunion between the welloff and the poor is
    extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions The white and
    Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
    population often approaching European standards whereas indigenous groups
    suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the
    African continent The outbreak of severe rioting in February 
    illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions The economic
    wellbeing of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from
    France

Romania Economy

Overview
    Industry which accounts for about onethird of the labor force and
    generates over half the GDP suffers from an aging capital plant and
    persistent shortages of energy The year  witnessed about a  drop in
    industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor
    unrest In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with
    flooding mismanagement shortages of inputs and disarray caused by the
    dismantling of cooperatives A shortage of fuel and equipment in 
    contributed to a lackluster harvest a problem compounded by corruption and
    a poor distribution system The new government is loosening the tight
    central controls of CEAUSESCUS command economy It has instituted moderate
    land reforms with more than onehalf of cropland now in private hands and
    it has liberalized private agricultural output Also the new regime is
    permitting the establishment of private enterprises largely in services
    handicrafts and smallscale industry A law providing for the privatization
    of large state firms has been passed Most of the large state firms have
    been converted into jointstock companies but the selling of shares and
    assets to private owners has been delayed While the government has halted
    the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency
    export markets supplies remain scarce in some areas Furthermore real
    wages in Romania fell about  in  contributing to the unrest which
    forced the resignation of ROMAN in September The new government continues
    to impose price ceilings on key consumer items

Russia Economy

Overview
    Russia one of the worlds largest economies possesses a wealth of natural
    resources and a diverse industrial base Within the nowdismantled USSR it
    had produced  of total output with  of the total labor force and 
    of the total capital stock Russia depends on its worldclass deposits of
    oil and gas not only for its own needs but also for vital hard currency
    earnings Selfsufficient in coal and iron ore it has a crude steel
    production capacity of about  million tons second only to Japan Russias
    machinebuilding sector   of the old USSRs  lags behind world
    standards of efficiency and quality of product Other major industrial
    sectors  chemicals construction materials light industry and food
    processing  also suffer from quality problems obsolescent capital
    equipment and pollution Consumer goods have had lower priority and the
    product mix has not mirrored household preferences Furthermore the
    transition to a more marketoriented economy has disrupted channels of
    supply to factories and distribution outlets substantial imports of foods
    and medical supplies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption
    Russia inherited  of the former USSRs defense production facilities and
    is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these
    plants to civilian production Russia produces almost half of the old USSRs
    farm products but most warmclimate crops must be imported Under the old
    USSR production of industrial and agricultural goods often was concentrated
    in a single firm or a single republic Today producing units often have
    lost their major customers and their major sources of supply and the market
    institutions and incentives for adjusting to the new political and economic
    situations are only slowly emerging Rankandfile Russians will continue to
    suffer major deprivations in  and beyond before the country begins to
    realize its great economic potential The comprehensive economic reform
    program enacted in January  faces many economic and political hurdles
