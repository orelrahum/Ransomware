Afghanistan Economy

Overview
    Fundamentally Afghanistan is an extremely poor landlocked country highly
    dependent on farming wheat especially and livestock raising sheep and
    goats Economic considerations however have played second fiddle to
    political and military upheavals during more than  years of war including
    the nearly year Soviet military occupation which ended  February
     Over the past decade onethird of the population fled the country
    with Pakistan sheltering more than  million refugees and Iran about 
    million Another  million probably moved into and around urban areas within
    Afghanistan Although reliable data are unavailable gross domestic product
    is lower than  years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the
    disruption of trade and transport

Albania Economy

Overview
    The Albanian economy already providing the lowest standard of living in
    Europe contracted sharply in  with most industries producing at only a
    fraction of past levels and an unemployment rate estimated at  For over
     years the Stalinisttype economy has operated on the principle of
    central planning and state ownership of the means of production Albania
    began fitful economic reforms during  including the liberalization of
    prices and trade the privatization of shops and transport and land reform
    These reform measures were crippled however by the widespread civil
    disorder that accompanied the collapse of the Communist state Following
    their overwhelming victory in the  March  elections the new
    Democratic government announced a program of shock therapy to stabilize the
    economy and establish a market economy In an effort to expand international
    ties Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the former Soviet
    Union and the US and has joined the IMF and World Bank The Albanians have
    also passed legislation allowing foreign investment Albania possesses
    considerable mineral resources and until  was largely selfsufficient
    in food however the breakup of cooperative farms in  and general
    economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign aid to maintain adequate
    supplies Available statistics on Albanian economic activity are rudimentary
