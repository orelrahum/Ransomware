Russia Economy

Overview
    Russia one of the worlds largest economies possesses a wealth of natural
    resources and a diverse industrial base Within the nowdismantled USSR it
    had produced  of total output with  of the total labor force and 
    of the total capital stock Russia depends on its worldclass deposits of
    oil and gas not only for its own needs but also for vital hard currency
    earnings Selfsufficient in coal and iron ore it has a crude steel
    production capacity of about  million tons second only to Japan Russias
    machinebuilding sector   of the old USSRs  lags behind world
    standards of efficiency and quality of product Other major industrial
    sectors  chemicals construction materials light industry and food
    processing  also suffer from quality problems obsolescent capital
    equipment and pollution Consumer goods have had lower priority and the
    product mix has not mirrored household preferences Furthermore the
    transition to a more marketoriented economy has disrupted channels of
    supply to factories and distribution outlets substantial imports of foods
    and medical supplies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption
    Russia inherited  of the former USSRs defense production facilities and
    is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these
    plants to civilian production Russia produces almost half of the old USSRs
    farm products but most warmclimate crops must be imported Under the old
    USSR production of industrial and agricultural goods often was concentrated
    in a single firm or a single republic Today producing units often have
    lost their major customers and their major sources of supply and the market
    institutions and incentives for adjusting to the new political and economic
    situations are only slowly emerging Rankandfile Russians will continue to
    suffer major deprivations in  and beyond before the country begins to
    realize its great economic potential The comprehensive economic reform
    program enacted in January  faces many economic and political hurdles
    before it will lead to sustained economic growth

Rwanda Economy

Overview
    Almost  of GDP comes from the agricultural sector coffee and tea make up
     of total exports The amount of fertile land is limited however and
    deforestation and soil erosion have created problems The industrial sector
    in Rwanda is small contributing only  to GDP Manufacturing focuses
    mainly on the processing of agricultural products The Rwandan economy
    remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid Weak international
    prices since  have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
    decline A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
    October  An outbreak of insurgency also in October has dampened any
    prospects for economic improvement
