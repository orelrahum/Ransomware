DISCUSSION  Indexing and searchability of all English words in Perseus 
Several features of Perseus   Several levels of customization
possible  Perseus used for general education  Perseus effects on
education  Contextual information in Perseus  Main challenge and
emphasis of Perseus 


Several points emerged in the discussion that followed MYLONASs presentation

Although MYLONAS had not demonstrated Perseus ability to crosssearch
documents she confirmed that all English words in Perseus are indexed
and can be searched  So for example sacrifice could have been searched
in all texts the historical essay and all the catalogue entries with
their descriptionsin short in all of Perseus

Boolean logic is not in Perseus  but will be added to the next
version although an effort is being made not to restrict Perseus to a
database in which one just performs searching Boolean or otherwise  It
is possible to move laterally through the documents by selecting a word
one is interested in and selecting an area of information one is
interested in and trying to look that word up in that area

Since Perseus was developed in HyperCard several levels of customization
are possible  Simple authoring tools exist that allow one to create
annotated paths through the information which are useful for notetaking
and for guided tours for teaching purposes and for expository writing
With a little more ingenuity it is possible to begin to add or substitute
material in Perseus

Perseus has not been used so much for classics education as for general
education where it seemed to have an impact on the students in the core
course at Harvard a general required course that students must take in
certain areas  Students were able to use primary material much more

The Perseus Project has an evaluation team at the University of Maryland
that has been documenting Perseus effects on education  Perseus is very
popular and anecdotal evidence indicates that it is having an effect at
places other than Harvard for example test sites at Ball State
University Drury College and numerous small places where opportunities
to use vast amounts of primary data may not exist  One documented effect
is that archaeological anthropological and philological research is
being done by the same person instead of by three different people

The contextual information in Perseus includes an overview essay a
fairly linear historical essay on the fifth century BC that provides
links into the primary material eg Herodotus Thucydides and
Plutarch via small gray underscoring on the screen of linked
passages  These are handmade links into other material

To different extents most of the production work was done at Harvard
where the people and the equipment are located  Much of the
