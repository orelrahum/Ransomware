No sooner did thy dear and only Son
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
So strictly but much more to pity inclined
He to appease thy wrath and end the strife
Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned
Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
Second to thee offered himself to die
For Mans offence  O unexampled love
Love no where to be found less than Divine
Hail Son of God Saviour of Men  Thy name
Shall be the copious matter of my song
Henceforth and never shall my heart thy praise
Forget nor from thy Fathers praise disjoin
Thus they in Heaven above the starry sphere
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent
Mean while upon the firm opacous globe
Of this round world whose first convex divides
The luminous inferiour orbs enclosed
From Chaos and the inroad of Darkness old
Satan alighted walks  A globe far off
It seemed now seems a boundless continent
Dark waste and wild under the frown of Night
Starless exposed and everthreatening storms
Of Chaos blustering round inclement sky
Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven
Though distant far some small reflection gains
Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field
As when a vultur on Imaus bred
Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds
Dislodging from a region scarce of prey
To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids
On hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs
Of Ganges or Hydaspes Indian streams
But in his way lights on the barren plains
Of Sericana where Chineses drive
With sails and wind their cany waggons light
So on this windy sea of land the Fiend
Walked up and down alone bent on his prey
Alone for other creature in this place
Living or lifeless to be found was none
None yet but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like aereal vapours flew
Of all things transitory and vain when sin
With vanity had filled the works of men
Both all things vain and all who in vain things
Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame
Or happiness in this or the other life
All who have their reward on earth the fruits
Of painful superstition and blind zeal
Nought seeking but the praise of men here find
Fit retribution empty as their deeds
All the unaccomplished works of Natures hand
Abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed
Dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain
Till final dissolution wander here
Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed
Those argent fields more likely habitants
Translated Saints or middle Spirits hold
Betwixt the angelical and human kind
Hither of illjoined sons and daughters born
First from the ancient world those giants came
With many a vain exploit though then renowned
The builders next of Babel on the plain
Of Sennaar and still with vain design
New Babels had they wherewithal would build
Others came single he who to be deemed
A God leaped fondly into Aetna flames
Empedocles and he who to enjoy
Platos Elysium leaped into the sea
Cleombrotus and many more too long
Embryos and idiots eremites and friars
White black and gray with all their trumpery
Here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek
In Golgotha him dead who lives in Heaven
And they who to be sure of Paradise
Dying put on the weeds of Dominick
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised
They pass the planets seven and pass the fixed
And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs
The trepidation talked and that first moved
And now Saint Peter at Heavens wicket seems
To wait them with his keys and now at foot
Of Heavens ascent they lift their feet when lo
A violent cross wind from either coast
Blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry
Into the devious air  Then might ye see
Cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tost
And fluttered into rags then reliques beads
Indulgences dispenses pardons bulls
The sport of winds  All these upwhirled aloft
Fly oer the backside of the world far off
Into a Limbo large and broad since called
The Paradise of Fools to few unknown
Long after now unpeopled and untrod
All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed
And long he wandered till at last a gleam
Of dawning light turned thitherward in haste
His travelled steps far distant he descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high
At top whereof but far more rich appeared
The work as of a kingly palacegate
With frontispiece of diamond and gold
Embellished thick with sparkling orient gems
The portal shone inimitable on earth
