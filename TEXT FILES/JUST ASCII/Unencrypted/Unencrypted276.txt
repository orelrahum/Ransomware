All of the indices driving this kind of usage were originally devised for
speed MYLONAS observed in other words all that kind of information
all forms of all words where they exist the dictionary form they belong
towere collected into databases which will expedite searching  Then
it was discovered that one can do things searching in these databases
that could not be done searching in the full texts  Thus although there
are fulltext searches in Perseus much of the work is done behind the
scenes using prepared indices  Re the indexing that is done behind the
scenes MYLONAS pointed out that without the SGML forms of the text it
could not be done effectively  Much of this indexing is based on the
structures that are made explicit by the SGML tagging

It was found that one of the things many of Perseus nonGreekreading
users do is start from the dictionary and then move into the close study
of words and concepts via this kind of EnglishGreek word search by which
means they might select a concept  This exercise has been assigned to
students in core courses at Harvardto study a concept by looking for the
English word in the dictionary finding the Greek words and then finding
the words in the Greek but of course reading across in the English
That tells them a great deal about what a translation means as well

Should one also wish to see images that have to do with sacrifice that
person would go to the object key word search which allows one to
perform a similar kind of index retrieval on the database of
archaeological objects  Without words pictures are useless Perseus has
not reached the point where it can do much with images that are not
cataloged  Thus although it is possible in Perseus with text and images
to navigate by knowing where one wants to end upfor example a
redfigure vase from the Boston Museum of Fine Artsone can perform this
kind of navigation very easily by tracing down indices  MYLONAS
illustrated several generic scenes of sacrifice on vases  The features
demonstrated derived from Perseus  version  will implement even
better means of retrieval

MYLONAS closed by looking at one of the pictures and noting again that
one can do a great deal of research using the iconography as well as the
texts  For instance students in a core course at Harvard this year were
highly interested in Greek concepts of foreigners and representations of
nonGreeks  So they performed a great deal of research both with texts
eg Herodotus and with iconography on vases and coins on how the
Greeks portrayed nonGreeks  At the same time art historians who study
iconography were also interested and were able to use this material

                                 


DISCUSSION  Indexing and searchability of all English words in Perseus 
Several features of Perseus   Several levels of customization
possible  Perseus used for general education  Perseus effects on
education  Contextual information in Perseus  Main challenge and
emphasis of Perseus 


Several points emerged in the discussion that followed MYLONASs presentation

Although MYLONAS had not demonstrated Perseus ability to crosssearch
documents she confirmed that all English words in Perseus are indexed
and can be searched  So for example sacrifice could have been searched
in all texts the historical essay and all the catalogue entries with
their descriptionsin short in all of Perseus

Boolean logic is not in Perseus  but will be added to the next
version although an effort is being made not to restrict Perseus to a
database in which one just performs searching Boolean or otherwise  It
is possible to move laterally through the documents by selecting a word
one is interested in and selecting an area of information one is
interested in and trying to look that word up in that area

Since Perseus was developed in HyperCard several levels of customization
are possible  Simple authoring tools exist that allow one to create
annotated paths through the information which are useful for notetaking
and for guided tours for teaching purposes and for expository writing
With a little more ingenuity it is possible to begin to add or substitute
material in Perseus

Perseus has not been used so much for classics education as for general
education where it seemed to have an impact on the students in the core
course at Harvard a general required course that students must take in
certain areas  Students were able to use primary material much more

The Perseus Project has an evaluation team at the University of Maryland
that has been documenting Perseus effects on education  Perseus is very
popular and anecdotal evidence indicates that it is having an effect at
places other than Harvard for example test sites at Ball State
University Drury College and numerous small places where opportunities
to use vast amounts of primary data may not exist  One documented effect
is that archaeological anthropological and philological research is
being done by the same person instead of by three different people

The contextual information in Perseus includes an overview essay a
fairly linear historical essay on the fifth century BC that provides
links into the primary material eg Herodotus Thucydides and
Plutarch via small gray underscoring on the screen of linked
passages  These are handmade links into other material

To different extents most of the production work was done at Harvard
where the people and the equipment are located  Much of the
collaborative activity involved data collection and structuring because
the main challenge and the emphasis of Perseus is the gathering of
primary material that is building a useful environment for studying
classical Greece collecting data and making it useful
Systemsbuilding is definitely not the main concern  Thus much of the
work has involved writing essays collecting information rewriting it
and tagging it  That can be done off site  The creative link for the
overview essay as well as for both systems and data was collaborative
and was forged via Email and paper mail with professors at Pomona and
Bowdoin

                                 


CALALUCA  PLDs principal focus and contribution to scholarship 
Various questions preparatory to beginning the project  Basis for
project  Basic rule in converting PLD  Concerning the images in PLD 
Running PLD under a variety of retrieval softwares  Encoding the
database a hardfought issue  Various features demonstrated  Importance
of user documentation  Limitations of the CDROM version 


Eric CALALUCA vice president ChadwyckHealey Inc demonstrated a
software interpretation of the Patrologia Latina Database PLD  PLDs
principal focus from the beginning of the project about threeandahalf
years ago was on converting Mignes Latin series and in the end
CALALUCA suggested conversion of the text will be the major contribution
to scholarship  CALALUCA stressed that as possibly the only private
publishing organization at the Workshop ChadwyckHealey had sought no
federal funds or national foundation support before embarking upon the
project but instead had relied upon a great deal of homework and
marketing to accomplish the task of conversion

Ever since the possibilities of computersearching have emerged scholars
in the field of late ancient and early medieval studies philosophers
theologians classicists and those studying the history of natural law
and the history of the legal development of Western civilization have
been longing for a fully searchable version of Western literature for
example all the texts of Augustine and Bernard of Clairvaux and
Boethius not to mention all the secondary and tertiary authors

Various questions arose CALALUCA said  Should one convert Migne?
Should the database be encoded?  Is it necessary to do that?  How should
it be delivered?  What about CDROM?  Since this is a transitional
medium why even bother to create software to run on a CDROM?  Since
everybody knows people will be networking information why go to the
troublewhich is far greater with CDROM than with the production of
magnetic data?  Finally how does one make the data available?  Can many
of the hurdles to using electronic information that some publishers have
imposed upon databases be eliminated?

The PLD project was based on the principle that computersearching of
texts is most effective when it is done with a large database  Because
PLD represented a collection that serves so many disciplines across so
many periods it was irresistible

The basic rule in converting PLD was to do no harm to avoid the sins of
intrusion in such a database  no introduction of newer editions no
onthespot changes no eradicating of all possible falsehoods from an
edition  Thus PLD is not the final act in electronic publishing for
this discipline but simply the beginning  The conversion of PLD has
evoked numerous unanticipated questions  How will information be used?
What about networking?  Can the rights of a database be protected?
Should one protect the rights of a database?  How can it be made
available?

Those converting PLD also tried to avoid the sins of omission that is
excluding portions of the collections or whole sections  What about the
images?  PLD is full of images some are extremely pious
nineteenthcentury representations of the Fathers while others contain
highly interesting elements  The goal was to cover all the text of Migne
including notes in Greek and in Hebrew the latter of which in
particular causes problems in creating a search structure all the
indices and even the images which are being scanned in separately
searchable files

Several North American institutions that have placed acquisition requests
for the PLD database have requested it in magnetic form without software
which means they are already running it without software without
anything demonstrated at the Workshop

What cannot practically be done is go back and reconvert and reencode
data a timeconsuming and extremely costly enterprise  CALALUCA sees
PLD as a database that can and should be run under a variety of
retrieval softwares  This will permit the widest possible searches
Consequently the need to produce a CDROM of PLD as well as to develop
software that could handle some  gigabyte of heavily encoded text
developed out of conversations with collection development and reference
librarians who wanted software both compassionate enough for the
pedestrian but also capable of incorporating the most detailed
lexicographical studies that a user desires to conduct  In the end the
encoding and conversion of the data will prove the most enduring
testament to the value of the project

The encoding of the database was also a hardfought issue  Did the
database need to be encoded? Were there normative structures for encoding
humanist texts?  Should it be SGML?  What about the TEIwill it last
will it prove useful?  CALALUCA expressed some minor doubts as to whether
a data bank can be fully TEIconformant  Every effort can be made but
in the end to be TEIconformant means to accept the need to make some
firm encoding decisions that can indeed be disputed  The TEI points
the publisher in a proper direction but does not presume to make all the
decisions for him or her  Essentially the goal of encoding was to
eliminate as much as possible the hindrances to informationnetworking
so that if an institution acquires a database everybody associated with
the institution can have access to it

CALALUCA demonstrated a portion of Volume  because it had the most
anomalies in it  The software was created by Electronic Book
Technologies of Providence RI and is called Dynatext  The software
works only with SGMLcoded data

Viewing a table of contents on the screen the audience saw how Dynatext
treats each element as a book and attempts to simplify movement through a
volume  Familiarity with the Patrologia in print ie the text its
source and the editions will make the machinereadable versions highly
useful  Software with a Windows application was sought for PLD
CALALUCA said because this was the main trend for scholarly use

CALALUCA also demonstrated how a user can perform a variety of searches
and quickly move to any part of a volume the lookup screen provides
some basic simple wordsearching

CALALUCA argued that one of the major difficulties is not the software
Rather in creating a product that will be used by scholars representing
a broad spectrum of computer sophistication  user documentation proves
to be the most important service one can provide

CALALUCA next illustrated a truncated search under mysterium within ten
words of virtus and how one would be able to find its contents throughout
the entire database  He said that the exciting thing about PLD is that
many of the applications in the retrieval software being written for it
will exceed the capabilities of the software employed now for the CDROM
version  The CDROM faces genuine limitations in terms of speed and
comprehensiveness in the creation of a retrieval software to run it
CALALUCA said he hoped that individual scholars will download the data
if they wish to their personal computers and have ready access to
important texts on a constant basis which they will be able to use in
their research and from which they might even be able to publish

CALALUCA explained that the blue numbers represented Mignes column numbers
which are the standard scholarly references  Pulling up a note he stated
that these texts were heavily edited and the image files would appear simply
as a note as well so that one could quickly access an image

A demonstration of American Memory by its coordinator Carl FLEISCHHAUER
and Ricky ERWAY associate coordinator Library of Congress concluded
the morning session  Beginning with a collection of broadsides from the
Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention the only text
collection in a presentable form at the time of the Workshop FLEISCHHAUER
highlighted several of the problems with which AM is still wrestling
In its final form the disk will contain two collections not only the
broadsides but also the full text with illustrations of a set of
approximately  AfricanAmerican pamphlets from the period  to 

As FREEMAN had explained earlier AM has attempted to use a small amount
of interpretation to introduce collections  In the present case the
contractor a company named Quick Source in Silver Spring MD used
software called Toolbook and put together a modestly interactive
introduction to the collection  Like the two preceding speakers
FLEISCHHAUER argued that the real asset was the underlying collection

FLEISCHHAUER proceeded to describe various search and retrieval
capabilities while ERWAY worked the computer  In this particular package
the "go to" pulldown allowed the user in effect to jump out of Toolbook
where the interactive program was located and enter the thirdparty
software used by AM for this text collection which is called Personal
Librarian  This was the Windows version of Personal Librarian a
software application put together by a company in Rockville Md

Since the broadsides came from the Revolutionary War period a search was
conducted using the words British or war with the default operator reset
as or  FLEISCHHAUER demonstrated both automatic stemming which finds
other forms of the same root and a truncated search  One of Personal
Librarians strongest features the relevance ranking was represented by
a chart that indicated how often words being sought appeared in
documents with the one receiving the most "hits" obtaining the highest
score  The "hit list" that is supplied takes the relevance ranking into
account making the first hit in effect the one the software has
selected as the most relevant example

While in the text of one of the broadside documents FLEISCHHAUER
remarked AMs attempt to find ways to connect cataloging to the texts
which it does in different ways in different manifestations  In the case
shown the cataloging was pasted on  AM took MARC records that were
written as online records right into one of the Librarys mainframe
retrieval programs pulled them out and handed them off to the contractor
who massaged them somewhat to display them in the manner shown  One of
AMs questions is Does the cataloguing normally performed in the mainframe
work in this context or had AM ought to think through adjustments?

FLEISCHHAUER made the additional point that as far as the text goes AM
has gravitated towards SGML he pointed to the boldface in the upper part
of the screen  Although extremely limited in its ability to translate
or interpret SGML Personal Librarian will furnish both bold and italics
on screen a fairly easy thing to do but it is one of the ways in which
SGML is useful

Striking a balance between quantity and quality has been a major concern
of AM with accuracy being one of the places where project staff have
felt that less than percent accuracy was not unacceptable
FLEISCHHAUER cited the example of the standard of the rekeying industry
namely  percent as one service bureau informed him to go from
