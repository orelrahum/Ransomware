Must exercise us without hope of end
The vassals of his anger when the scourge
Inexorably and the torturing hour
Calls us to penance? More destroyed than thus
We should be quite abolished and expire
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense
His utmost ire? which to the height enraged
Will either quite consume us and reduce
To nothing this essentialhappier far
Than miserable to have eternal being
Or if our substance be indeed divine
And cannot cease to be we are at worst
On this side nothing and by proof we feel
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven
And with perpetual inroads to alarm
Though inaccessible his fatal throne
Which if not victory is yet revenge"
  He ended frowning and his look denounced
Desperate revenge and battle dangerous
To less than gods On th other side up rose
Belial in act more graceful and humane
A fairer person lost not Heaven he seemed
For dignity composed and high exploit
But all was false and hollow though his tongue
Dropped manna and could make the worse appear
The better reason to perplex and dash
Maturest counsels for his thoughts were low
 To vice industrious but to nobler deeds
Timorous and slothful Yet he pleased the ear
And with persuasive accent thus began
  "I should be much for open war O Peers
As not behind in hate if what was urged
Main reason to persuade immediate war
Did not dissuade me most and seem to cast
Ominous conjecture on the whole success
When he who most excels in fact of arms
In what he counsels and in what excels
Mistrustful grounds his courage on despair
And utter dissolution as the scope
Of all his aim after some dire revenge
First what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled
With armed watch that render all access
Impregnable oft on the bodering Deep
Encamp their legions or with obscure wing
Scout far and wide into the realm of Night
Scorning surprise Or could we break our way
By force and at our heels all Hell should rise
With blackest insurrection to confound
Heavens purest light yet our great Enemy
All incorruptible would on his throne
Sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould
Incapable of stain would soon expel
Her mischief and purge off the baser fire
Victorious Thus repulsed our final hope
Is flat despair we must exasperate
Th Almighty Victor to spend all his rage
And that must end us that must be our cure
To be no more Sad cure for who would lose
Though full of pain this intellectual being
Those thoughts that wander through eternity
To perish rather swallowed up and lost
In the wide womb of uncreated Night
Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows
Let this be good whether our angry Foe
Can give it or will ever? How he can
Is doubtful that he never will is sure
Will he so wise let loose at once his ire
Belike through impotence or unaware
To give his enemies their wish and end
Them in his anger whom his anger saves
To punish endless? Wherefore cease we then?
Say they who counsel war we are decreed
Reserved and destined to eternal woe
Whatever doing what can we suffer more
What can we suffer worse? Is this then worst
Thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms?
What when we fled amain pursued and struck
With Heavens afflicting thunder and besought
The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed
A refuge from those wounds Or when we lay
Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires
Awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage
And plunge us in the flames or from above
Should intermitted vengeance arm again
His red right hand to plague us? What if all
Her stores were opened and this firmament
Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire
Impendent horrors threatening hideous fall
One day upon our heads while we perhaps
Designing or exhorting glorious war
Caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled
Each on his rock transfixed the sport and prey
Or racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk
Under yon boiling ocean wrapt in chains
There to converse with everlasting groans
Unrespited unpitied unreprieved
Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse
War therefore open or concealed alike
My voice dissuades for what can force or guile
With him or who deceive his mind whose eye
Views all things at one view? He from Heavens height
All these our motions vain sees and derides
Not more almighty to resist our might
Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles
Shall we then live thus vilethe race of Heaven
Thus trampled thus expelled to suffer here
Chains and these torments? Better these than worse
By my advice since fate inevitable
Subdues us and omnipotent decree
The Victors will To suffer as to do
Our strength is equal nor the law unjust
That so ordains This was at first resolved
If we were wise against so great a foe
Contending and so doubtful what might fall
I laugh when those who at the spear are bold
And venturous if that fail them shrink and fear
What yet they know must followto endure
Exile or igominy or bonds or pain
The sentence of their Conqueror This is now
Our doom which if we can sustain and bear
Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit
His anger and perhaps thus far removed
Not mind us not offending satisfied
With what is punished whence these raging fires
Will slacken if his breath stir not their flames
Our purer essence then will overcome
Their noxious vapour or inured not feel
Or changed at length and to the place conformed
In temper and in nature will receive
Familiar the fierce heat and void of pain
This horror will grow mild this darkness light
Besides what hope the neverending flight
Of future days may bring what chance what change
Worth waitingsince our present lot appears
For happy though but ill for ill not worst
If we procure not to ourselves more woe"
  Thus Belial with words clothed in reasons garb
Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth
Not peace and after him thus Mammon spake
  "Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven
We war if war be best or to regain
Our own right lost Him to unthrone we then
May hope when everlasting Fate shall yield
To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife
The former vain to hope argues as vain
The latter for what place can be for us
Within Heavens bound unless Heavens Lord supreme
We overpower? Suppose he should relent
And publish grace to all on promise made
Of new subjection with what eyes could we
Stand in his presence humble and receive
Strict laws imposed to celebrate his throne
With warbled hyms and to his Godhead sing
Forced hallelujahs while he lordly sits
Our envied sovereign and his altar breathes
Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers
Our servile offerings? This must be our task
In Heaven this our delight How wearisome
Eternity so spent in worship paid
To whom we hate Let us not then pursue
By force impossible by leave obtained
Unacceptable though in Heaven our state
Of splendid vassalage but rather seek
Our own good from ourselves and from our own
Live to ourselves though in this vast recess
Free and to none accountable preferring
Hard liberty before the easy yoke
Of servile pomp Our greatness will appear
Then most conspicuous when great things of small
Useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse
We can create and in what place soeer
Thrive under evil and work ease out of pain
Through labour and endurance This deep world
Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst
Thick clouds and dark doth Heavens allruling Sire
Choose to reside his glory unobscured
And with the majesty of darkness round
Covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar
Mustering their rage and Heaven resembles Hell
As he our darkness cannot we his light
Imitate when we please? This desert soil
Wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold
Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
Magnificence and what can Heaven show more?
Our torments also may in length of time
Become our elements these piercing fires
As soft as now severe our temper changed
Into their temper which must needs remove
The sensible of pain All things invite
To peaceful counsels and the settled state
Of order how in safety best we may
Compose our present evils with regard
Of what we are and where dismissing quite
All thoughts of war Ye have what I advise"
  He scarce had finished when such murmur filled
Th assembly as when hollow rocks retain
The sound of blustering winds which all night long
Had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull
Seafaring men oerwatched whose bark by chance
Or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay
After the tempest Such applause was heard
As Mammon ended and his sentence pleased
Advising peace for such another field
They dreaded worse than Hell so much the fear
Of thunder and the sword of Michael
Wrought still within them and no less desire
To found this nether empire which might rise
By policy and long process of time
In emulation opposite to Heaven
Which when Beelzebub perceivedthan whom
Satan except none higher satwith grave
Aspect he rose and in his rising seemed
A pillar of state Deep on his front engraven
Deliberation sat and public care
And princely counsel in his face yet shone
Majestic though in ruin Sage he stood
With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear
The weight of mightiest monarchies his look
Drew audience and attention still as night
Or summers noontide air while thus he spake
  "Thrones and Imperial Powers Offspring of Heaven
Ethereal Virtues or these titles now
Must we renounce and changing style be called
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote
Inclineshere to continue and build up here
A growing empire doubtless while we dream
And know not that the King of Heaven hath doomed
This place our dungeon not our safe retreat
Beyond his potent arm to live exempt
From Heavens high jurisdiction in new league
Banded against his throne but to remain
In strictest bondage though thus far removed
Under th inevitable curb reserved
His captive multitude For he to be sure
In height or depth still first and last will reign
Sole king and of his kingdom lose no part
By our revolt but over Hell extend
His empire and with iron sceptre rule
Us here as with his golden those in Heaven
What sit we then projecting peace and war?
War hath determined us and foiled with loss
Irreparable terms of peace yet none
Vouchsafed or sought for what peace will be given
To us enslaved but custody severe
And stripes and arbitrary punishment
Inflicted? and what peace can we return
But to our power hostility and hate
Untamed reluctance and revenge though slow
Yet ever plotting how the Conqueror least
May reap his conquest and may least rejoice
In doing what we most in suffering feel?
Nor will occasion want nor shall we need
With dangerous expedition to invade
Heaven whose high walls fear no assault or siege
Or ambush from the Deep What if we find
Some easier enterprise? There is a place
If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven
Err notanother World the happy seat
Of some new race called Man about this time
To be created like to us though less
In power and excellence but favoured more
Of him who rules above so was his will
Pronounced among the Gods and by an oath
That shook Heavens whole circumference confirmed
Thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn
What creatures there inhabit of what mould
Or substance how endued and what their power
And where their weakness how attempted best
By force of subtlety Though Heaven be shut
And Heavens high Arbitrator sit secure
In his own strength this place may lie exposed
The utmost border of his kingdom left
To their defence who hold it here perhaps
Some advantageous act may be achieved
By sudden onseteither with Hellfire
To waste his whole creation or possess
All as our own and drive as we were driven
The puny habitants or if not drive
Seduce them to our party that their God
May prove their foe and with repenting hand
Abolish his own works This would surpass
Common revenge and interrupt his joy
In our confusion and our joy upraise
In his disturbance when his darling sons
Hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse
Their frail original and faded bliss
Faded so soon Advise if this be worth
Attempting or to sit in darkness here
Hatching vain empires" Thus beelzebub
Pleaded his devilish counselfirst devised
By Satan and in part proposed for whence
But from the author of all ill could spring
So deep a malice to confound the race
Of mankind in one root and Earth with Hell
To mingle and involve done all to spite
The great Creator? But their spite still serves
His glory to augment The bold design
Pleased highly those infernal States and joy
Sparkled in all their eyes with full assent
They vote whereat his speech he thus renews
"Well have ye judged well ended long debate
Synod of Gods and like to what ye are
Great things resolved which from the lowest deep
Will once more lift us up in spite of fate
Nearer our ancient seatperhaps in view
Of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms
And opportune excursion we may chance
Reenter Heaven or else in some mild zone
Dwell not unvisited of Heavens fair light
Secure and at the brightening orient beam
Purge off this gloom the soft delicious air
To heal the scar of these corrosive fires
Shall breathe her balm But first whom shall we send
In search of this new World? whom shall we find
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet
The dark unbottomed infinite Abyss
And through the palpable obscure find out
His uncouth way or spread his airy flight
Upborne with indefatigable wings
Over the vast abrupt ere he arrive
The happy Isle? What strength what art can then
Suffice or what evasion bear him safe
Through the strict senteries and stations thick
Of Angels watching round? Here he had need
All circumspection and we now no less
Choice in our suffrage for on whom we send
The weight of all and our last hope relies"
  This said he sat and expectation held
His look suspense awaiting who appeared
To second or oppose or undertake
The perilous attempt But all sat mute
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each
In others countenance read his own dismay
Astonished None among the choice and prime
Of those Heavenwarring champions could be found
So hardy as to proffer or accept
Alone the dreadful voyage till at last
Satan whom now transcendent glory raised
Above his fellows with monarchal pride
Conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake
  "O Progeny of Heaven Empyreal Thrones
With reason hath deep silence and demur
Seized us though undismayed Long is the way
And hard that out of Hell leads up to light
Our prison strong this huge convex of fire
Outrageous to devour immures us round
Ninefold and gates of burning adamant
Barred over us prohibit all egress
