  How should I know? said Alice surprised at her own courage
Its no business of MINE

  The Queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her
for a moment like a wild beast screamed Off with her head
Off

  Nonsense said Alice very loudly and decidedly and the
Queen was silent

  The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said
Consider my dear  she is only a child

  The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave
Turn them over

  The Knave did so very carefully with one foot

  Get up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the
three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the
King the Queen the royal children and everybody else

  Leave off that screamed the Queen  You make me giddy
And then turning to the rosetree she went on What HAVE you
been doing here?

  May it please your Majesty said Two in a very humble tone
going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying

  I see said the Queen who had meanwhile been examining the
roses  Off with their heads and the procession moved on
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
gardeners who ran to Alice for protection

  You shant be beheaded said Alice and she put them into a
large flowerpot that stood near  The three soldiers wandered
about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly
marched off after the others

  Are their heads off? shouted the Queen

  Their heads are gone if it please your Majesty the soldiers
shouted in reply

  Thats right shouted the Queen  Can you play croquet?

  The soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question
was evidently meant for her

  Yes shouted Alice

  Come on then roared the Queen and Alice joined the
procession wondering very much what would happen next

  Itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side
She was walking by the White Rabbit who was peeping anxiously
into her face

  Very said Alice  wheres the Duchess?

  Hush  Hush said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone  He
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised
himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and
whispered Shes under sentence of execution

  What for? said Alice
