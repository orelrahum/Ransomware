West Bank Header

Note
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June  ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Sinai and the Golan
    Heights As stated in the  Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bushs postGulf crisis peace initiative the final status of the
    West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined In the view of the US the term West Bank
    describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian
    administration before the  ArabIsraeli war However with respect to
    negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement it is US policy that a
    distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank
    because of the citys special status and circumstances Therefore a
    negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in
    character from that of the rest of the West Bank
