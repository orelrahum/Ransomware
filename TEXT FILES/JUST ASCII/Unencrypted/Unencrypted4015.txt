he was speaking and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil  But
perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so
VERY nearly at the top of his head  But at any rate he might
answer questionsHow am I to get in? she repeated aloud

  I shall sit here the Footman remarked till tomorrow

  At this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate
came skimming out straight at the Footmans head  it just
grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees
behind him

  or next day maybe the Footman continued in the same tone
exactly as if nothing had happened

  How am I to get in? asked Alice again in a louder tone

  ARE you to get in at all? said the Footman  Thats the
first question you know

  It was no doubt  only Alice did not like to be told so
Its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the
creatures argue  Its enough to drive one crazy
