An exchange between MYLONAS and BATTIN clarified the point that the
driving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects was
the preservation of knowledge for the future not simply for particular
research use  In the case of Perseus MYLONAS said the assumption was
that the texts would not be entered again into electronically readable
form  SPERBERGMcQUEEN added that a scanned image would not serve as an
archival copy for purposes of preservation in the case of say the Bill
of Rights in the sense that the scanned images are effectively the
archival copies for the Cornell mathematics books
