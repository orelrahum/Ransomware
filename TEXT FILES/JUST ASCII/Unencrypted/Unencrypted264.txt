This is the driest thing I know  Silence all round if you please
"William the Conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was
soon submitted to by the English who wanted leaders and had been
of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest  Edwin and
Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria"

  Ugh said the Lory with a shiver

  I beg your pardon said the Mouse frowning but very
politely  Did you speak?

  Not I said the Lory hastily

  I thought you did said the Mouse  I proceed  "Edwin and
Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria declared for him
and even Stigand the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury found
it advisable"

  Found WHAT? said the Duck

  Found IT the Mouse replied rather crossly  of course you
know what "it" means

  I know what "it" means well enough when I find a thing said
the Duck  its generally a frog or a worm  The question is
what did the archbishop find?

  The Mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on
"found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William
and offer him the crown  Williams conduct at first was
moderate  But the insolence of his Normans"  How are you
getting on now my dear? it continued turning to Alice as it
spoke

  As wet as ever said Alice in a melancholy tone  it doesnt
seem to dry me at all

  In that case said the Dodo solemnly rising to its feet I
move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies

  Speak English said the Eaglet  I dont know the meaning of
half those long words and whats more I dont believe you do
either  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile
some of the other birds tittered audibly

  What I was going to say said the Dodo in an offended tone
was that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucusrace

  What IS a Caucusrace? said Alice not that she wanted much
to know but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything

  Why said the Dodo the best way to explain it is to do it
And as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter
day I will tell you how the Dodo managed it

  First it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the
exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party
were placed along the course here and there  There was no One
two three and away but they began running when they liked
and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know
when the race was over  However when they had been running half
an hour or so and were quite dry again the Dodo suddenly called
out The race is over and they all crowded round it panting
and asking But who has won?

  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare
in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence  At
last the Dodo said EVERYBODY has won and all must have
prizes

  But who is to give the prizes? quite a chorus of voices
asked

  Why SHE of course said the Dodo pointing to Alice with
one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her
calling out in a confused way Prizes Prizes

  Alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand
in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt
water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes
There was exactly one apiece all round

  But she must have a prize herself you know said the Mouse

  Of course the Dodo replied very gravely  What else have
you got in your pocket? he went on turning to Alice

  Only a thimble said Alice sadly

  Hand it over here said the Dodo

  Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo
solemnly presented the thimble saying We beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short
speech they all cheered

  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked
so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not
think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble
looking as solemn as she could

  The next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise
and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not
taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
the back  However it was over at last and they sat down again
in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more

  You promised to tell me your history you know said Alice
and why it is you hateC and D she added in a whisper half
afraid that it would be offended again

  Mine is a long and a sad tale said the Mouse turning to
Alice and sighing

  It IS a long tail certainly said Alice looking down with
wonder at the Mouses tail but why do you call it sad?  And
she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking so
that her idea of the tale was something like this

                    Fury said to a
                   mouse That he
                 met in the
               house
            "Let us
              both go to
                law  I will
                  prosecute
                    YOU  Come
                       Ill take no
                        denial We
                     must have a
                 trial  For
              really this
           morning Ive
          nothing
         to do"
           Said the
             mouse to the
               cur "Such
                 a trial
                   dear Sir
                         With
                     no jury
                  or judge
                would be
              wasting
             our
              breath"
               "Ill be
                 judge Ill
                   be jury"
                         Said
                    cunning
                      old Fury
                     "Ill
                      try the
                         whole
                          cause
                             and
                        condemn
                       you
                      to
                       death"


  You are not attending said the Mouse to Alice severely
What are you thinking of?

  I beg your pardon said Alice very humbly  you had got to
the fifth bend I think?

  I had NOT cried the Mouse sharply and very angrily

  A knot said Alice always ready to make herself useful and
looking anxiously about her  Oh do let me help to undo it

  I shall do nothing of the sort said the Mouse getting up
and walking away  You insult me by talking such nonsense

  I didnt mean it pleaded poor Alice  But youre so easily
offended you know

  The Mouse only growled in reply

  Please come back and finish your story Alice called after
it and the others all joined in chorus Yes please do but
the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little
quicker

  What a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the Lory as soon as it
was quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of
saying to her daughter Ah my dear  Let this be a lesson to you
never to lose YOUR temper  Hold your tongue Ma said the
young Crab a little snappishly  Youre enough to try the
patience of an oyster

  I wish I had our Dinah here I know I do said Alice aloud
addressing nobody in particular  Shed soon fetch it back

  And who is Dinah if I might venture to ask the question?
said the Lory

  Alice replied eagerly for she was always ready to talk about
her pet  Dinahs our cat  And shes such a capital one for
catching mice you cant think  And oh I wish you could see her
after the birds  Why shell eat a little bird as soon as look
at it

  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party
Some of the birds hurried off at once  one the old Magpie began
wrapping itself up very carefully remarking I really must be
getting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat and a Canary
called out in a trembling voice to its children Come away my
dears  Its high time you were all in bed  On various pretexts
they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone

  I wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah she said to herself in a
melancholy tone  Nobody seems to like her down here and Im
sure shes the best cat in the world  Oh my dear Dinah  I
wonder if I shall ever see you any more  And here poor Alice
began to cry again for she felt very lonely and lowspirited
In a little while however she again heard a little pattering of
footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping
that the Mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to
finish his story



                           CHAPTER IV

                The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


  It was the White Rabbit trotting slowly back again and
looking anxiously about as it went as if it had lost something
and she heard it muttering to itself The Duchess  The Duchess
Oh my dear paws  Oh my fur and whiskers  Shell get me
executed as sure as ferrets are ferrets  Where CAN I have
dropped them I wonder?  Alice guessed in a moment that it was
looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves and she
very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them but they were
nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her
swim in the pool and the great hall with the glass table and
the little door had vanished completely

  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice as she went hunting about
and called out to her in an angry tone Why Mary Ann what ARE
you doing out here?  Run home this moment and fetch me a pair of
gloves and a fan  Quick now  And Alice was so much frightened
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without
trying to explain the mistake it had made

  He took me for his housemaid she said to herself as she ran
How surprised hell be when he finds out who I am  But Id
better take him his fan and glovesthat is if I can find them
As she said this she came upon a neat little house on the door
of which was a bright brass plate with the name W RABBIT
engraved upon it  She went in without knocking and hurried
upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann
and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and
gloves

  How queer it seems Alice said to herself to be going
messages for a rabbit  I suppose Dinahll be sending me on
messages next  And she began fancying the sort of thing that
would happen  "Miss Alice  Come here directly and get ready
for your walk" "Coming in a minute nurse  But Ive got to see
that the mouse doesnt get out"  Only I dont think Alice went
on that theyd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
people about like that

  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with
a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves  she took up the fan and
a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when
her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking
glass  There was no label this time with the words DRINK ME
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips  I know
SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen she said to herself
whenever I eat or drink anything so Ill just see what this
bottle does  I do hope itll make me grow large again for
really Im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing

  It did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected
before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing
against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being
broken  She hastily put down the bottle saying to herself
Thats quite enoughI hope I shant grow any moreAs it is I
cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt drunk quite so
much

  Alas it was too late to wish that  She went on growing and
growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor  in
another minute there was not even room for this and she tried
the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the
other arm curled round her head  Still she went on growing and
as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one
foot up the chimney and said to herself Now I can do no more
whatever happens  What WILL become of me?

  Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full
effect and she grew no larger  still it was very uncomfortable
and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting
out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy

  It was much pleasanter at home thought poor Alice when one
wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about
by mice and rabbits  I almost wish I hadnt gone down that
rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know
this sort of life  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me
When I used to read fairytales I fancied that kind of thing
never happened and now here I am in the middle of one  There
ought to be a book written about me that there ought  And when
I grow up Ill write onebut Im grown up now she added in a
sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more
HERE

  But then thought Alice shall I NEVER get any older than I
am now?  Thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old woman
but thenalways to have lessons to learn  Oh I shouldnt like
THAT

  Oh you foolish Alice she answered herself  How can you
learn lessons in here?  Why theres hardly room for YOU and no
room at all for any lessonbooks

  And so she went on taking first one side and then the other
and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few
minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen

  Mary Ann  Mary Ann said the voice  Fetch me my gloves
this moment  Then came a little pattering of feet on the
stairs  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and
she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she
was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no
reason to be afraid of it

  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it
but as the door opened inwards and Alices elbow was pressed
hard against it that attempt proved a failure  Alice heard it
say to itself Then Ill go round and get in at the window

  THAT you wont thought Alice and after waiting till she
fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window she suddenly
spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air  She did not
get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall
and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was
just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something
