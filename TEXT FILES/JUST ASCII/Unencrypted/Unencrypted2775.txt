 Well pleased on me let Death wreak all his rage
 Under his gloomy power I shall not long
 Lie vanquished Thou hast given me to possess
 Life in myself for ever by thee I live
 Though now to Death I yield and am his due
 All that of me can die yet that debt paid
  thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave
 His prey nor suffer my unspotted soul
 For ever with corruption there to dwell
 But I shall rise victorious and subdue
 My vanquisher spoiled of his vaunted spoil
 Death his deaths wound shall then receive and stoop
 Inglorious of his mortal sting disarmed
 I through the ample air in triumph high
 Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell and show
The powers of darkness bound Thou at the sight
 Pleased out of Heaven shalt look down and smile
 While by thee raised I ruin all my foes
 Death last and with his carcase glut the grave
 Then with the multitude of my redeemed
 Shall enter Heaven long absent and return
 Father to see thy face wherein no cloud
 Of anger shall remain but peace assured
 And reconcilement wrath shall be no more
 Thenceforth but in thy presence joy entire
 His words here ended but his meek aspect
 Silent yet spake and breathed immortal love
 To mortal men above which only shone
 Filial obedience as a sacrifice
 Glad to be offered he attends the will
 Of his great Father Admiration seized
 All Heaven what this might mean and whither tend
 Wondering but soon th Almighty thus replied
 O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace
 Found out for mankind under wrath O thou
 My sole complacence Well thou knowst how dear
 To me are all my works nor Man the least
 Though last created that for him I spare
 Thee from my bosom and right hand to save
 By losing thee a while the whole race lost

     
 Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem
 Their nature also to thy nature join
 And be thyself Man among men on Earth
 Made flesh when time shall be of virgin seed
 By wondrous birth be thou in Adams room
The head of all mankind though Adams son
As in him perish all men so in thee
As from a second root shall be restored
As many as are restored without thee none
His crime makes guilty all his sons thy merit
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce
Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds
And live in thee transplanted and from thee
Receive new life  So Man as is most just
Shall satisfy for Man be judged and die
And dying rise and rising with him raise
His brethren ransomed with his own dear life
So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate
Giving to death and dying to redeem
So dearly to redeem what hellish hate
So easily destroyed and still destroys
In those who when they may accept not grace
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume
Mans nature lessen or degrade thine own
Because thou hast though throned in highest bliss
Equal to God and equally enjoying
Godlike fruition quitted all to save
A world from utter loss and hast been found
By merit more than birthright Son of God
Found worthiest to be so by being good
Far more than great or high because in thee
Love hath abounded more than glory abounds
Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt
With thee thy manhood also to this throne
Here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt reign
Both God and Man Son both of God and Man
Anointed universal King all power
I give thee reign for ever and assume
Thy merits under thee as head supreme
Thrones Princedoms Powers Dominions I reduce
All knees to thee shall bow of them that bide
In Heaven or Earth or under Earth in Hell
When thou attended gloriously from Heaven
Shalt in the sky appear and from thee send
The summoning ArchAngels to proclaim
Thy dread tribunal forthwith from all winds
The living and forthwith the cited dead
Of all past ages to the general doom
Shall hasten such a peal shall rouse their sleep
Then all thy saints assembled thou shalt judge
Bad Men and Angels they arraigned shall sink
Beneath thy sentence Hell her numbers full
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut  Mean while
The world shall burn and from her ashes spring
New Heaven and Earth wherein the just shall dwell
And after all their tribulations long
See golden days fruitful of golden deeds
With joy and peace triumphing and fair truth
Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by
For regal scepter then no more shall need
God shall be all in all  But all ye Gods
Adore him who to compass all this dies
Adore the Son and honour him as me
No sooner had the Almighty ceased but all
The multitude of Angels with a shout
Loud as from numbers without number sweet
As from blest voices uttering joy Heaven rung
With jubilee and loud Hosannas filled
The eternal regions  Lowly reverent
Towards either throne they bow and to the ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold
Immortal amarant a flower which once
In Paradise fast by the tree of life
Began to bloom but soon for mans offence
To Heaven removed where first it grew there grows
And flowers aloft shading the fount of life
And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven
Rolls oer Elysian flowers her amber stream
With these that never fade the Spirits elect
Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams
Now in loose garlands thick thrown off the bright
Pavement that like a sea of jasper shone
Impurpled with celestial roses smiled
Then crowned again their golden harps they took
Harps ever tuned that glittering by their side
Like quivers hung and with preamble sweet
Of charming symphony they introduce
Their sacred song and waken raptures high
No voice exempt no voice but well could join
Melodious part such concord is in Heaven
Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent
Immutable Immortal Infinite
Eternal King the Author of all being
Fonntain of light thyself invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitst
Throned inaccessible but when thou shadest
The full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear
Yet dazzle Heaven that brightest Seraphim
Approach not but with both wings veil their eyes
Thee next they sang of all creation first
Begotten Son Divine Similitude
In whose conspicuous countenance without cloud
Made visible the Almighty Father shines
Whom else no creature can behold on thee
Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests
He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
By thee created and by thee threw down
The aspiring Dominations  Thou that day
Thy Fathers dreadful thunder didst not spare
Nor stop thy flaming chariotwheels that shook
Heavens everlasting frame while oer the necks
Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim
Thee only extolled Son of thy Fathers might
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes
Not so on Man  Him through their malice fallen
Father of mercy and grace thou didst not doom
So strictly but much more to pity incline
No sooner did thy dear and only Son
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
So strictly but much more to pity inclined
He to appease thy wrath and end the strife
Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned
Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
Second to thee offered himself to die
For Mans offence  O unexampled love
Love no where to be found less than Divine
Hail Son of God Saviour of Men  Thy name
Shall be the copious matter of my song
Henceforth and never shall my heart thy praise
Forget nor from thy Fathers praise disjoin
Thus they in Heaven above the starry sphere
Their happy hours in joy and hymning spent
Mean while upon the firm opacous globe
Of this round world whose first convex divides
The luminous inferiour orbs enclosed
From Chaos and the inroad of Darkness old
Satan alighted walks  A globe far off
It seemed now seems a boundless continent
Dark waste and wild under the frown of Night
Starless exposed and everthreatening storms
Of Chaos blustering round inclement sky
Save on that side which from the wall of Heaven
Though distant far some small reflection gains
Of glimmering air less vexed with tempest loud
Here walked the Fiend at large in spacious field
As when a vultur on Imaus bred
Whose snowy ridge the roving Tartar bounds
Dislodging from a region scarce of prey
To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids
On hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs
Of Ganges or Hydaspes Indian streams
But in his way lights on the barren plains
Of Sericana where Chineses drive
With sails and wind their cany waggons light
So on this windy sea of land the Fiend
Walked up and down alone bent on his prey
Alone for other creature in this place
Living or lifeless to be found was none
None yet but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like aereal vapours flew
Of all things transitory and vain when sin
With vanity had filled the works of men
Both all things vain and all who in vain things
Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame
Or happiness in this or the other life
All who have their reward on earth the fruits
Of painful superstition and blind zeal
Nought seeking but the praise of men here find
Fit retribution empty as their deeds
All the unaccomplished works of Natures hand
Abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed
Dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain
Till final dissolution wander here
Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed
Those argent fields more likely habitants
Translated Saints or middle Spirits hold
Betwixt the angelical and human kind
Hither of illjoined sons and daughters born
First from the ancient world those giants came
With many a vain exploit though then renowned
The builders next of Babel on the plain
Of Sennaar and still with vain design
New Babels had they wherewithal would build
Others came single he who to be deemed
A God leaped fondly into Aetna flames
Empedocles and he who to enjoy
Platos Elysium leaped into the sea
Cleombrotus and many more too long
Embryos and idiots eremites and friars
White black and gray with all their trumpery
Here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek
In Golgotha him dead who lives in Heaven
And they who to be sure of Paradise
Dying put on the weeds of Dominick
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised
They pass the planets seven and pass the fixed
And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs
The trepidation talked and that first moved
And now Saint Peter at Heavens wicket seems
To wait them with his keys and now at foot
Of Heavens ascent they lift their feet when lo
A violent cross wind from either coast
Blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry
Into the devious air  Then might ye see
Cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tost
And fluttered into rags then reliques beads
Indulgences dispenses pardons bulls
The sport of winds  All these upwhirled aloft
Fly oer the backside of the world far off
Into a Limbo large and broad since called
The Paradise of Fools to few unknown
Long after now unpeopled and untrod
All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed
And long he wandered till at last a gleam
Of dawning light turned thitherward in haste
His travelled steps far distant he descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high
At top whereof but far more rich appeared
The work as of a kingly palacegate
With frontispiece of diamond and gold
Embellished thick with sparkling orient gems
The portal shone inimitable on earth
By model or by shading pencil drawn
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
Angels ascending and descending bands
Of guardians bright when he from Esau fled
To PadanAram in the field of Luz
Dreaming by night under the open sky
And waking cried  This is the gate of Heaven
Each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
There always but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
Viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed
Of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon
Who after came from earth failing arrived
Wafted by Angels or flew oer the lake
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds
The stairs were then let down whether to dare
The Fiend by easy ascent or aggravate
His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss
Direct against which opened from beneath
Just oer the blissful seat of Paradise
A passage down to the Earth a passage wide
Wider by far than that of aftertimes
Over mount Sion and though that were large
Over the Promised Land to God so dear
By which to visit oft those happy tribes
On high behests his angels to and fro
Passed frequent and his eye with choice regard
From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood
To Beersaba where the Holy Land
Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore
So wide the opening seemed where bounds were set
To darkness such as bound the ocean wave
Satan from hence now on the lower stair
That scaled by steps of gold to Heavengate
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this world at once  As when a scout
Through dark?nd desart ways with?oeril gone
All?might?t?kast by break of cheerful dawn
Obtains the brow of some highclimbing hill
Which to his eye discovers unaware
The goodly prospect of some foreign land
First seen or some renowned metropolis
With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned
Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams
Such wonder seised though after Heaven seen
The Spirit malign but much more envy seised
At sight of all this world beheld so fair
Round he surveys and well might where he stood
So high above the circling canopy
Of nights extended shade from eastern point
Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears
Andromeda far off Atlantick seas
Beyond the horizon then from pole to pole
He views in breadth and without longer pause
Down right into the worlds first region throws
His flight precipitant and winds with ease
Through the pure marble air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable stars that shone
Stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds
Or other worlds they seemed or happy isles
Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old
Fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales
Thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there
He staid not to inquire  Above them all
The golden sun in splendour likest Heaven
Allured his eye thither his course he bends
Through the calm firmament but up or down
By center or eccentrick hard to tell
Or longitude where the great luminary
Aloof the vulgar constellations thick
That from his lordly eye keep distance due
Dispenses light from far they as they move
Their starry dance in numbers that compute
Days months and years towards his allcheering lamp
Turn swift their various motions or are turned
By his magnetick beam that gently warms
The universe and to each inward part
With gentle penetration though unseen
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep
So wonderously was set his station bright
There lands the Fiend a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the suns lucent orb
Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw
The place he found beyond expression bright
Compared with aught on earth metal or stone
Not all parts like but all alike informed
With radiant light as glowing iron with fire
If metal part seemed gold part silver clear
If stone carbuncle most or chrysolite
Ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone
In Aarons breastplate and a stone besides
Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen
That stone or like to that which here below
Philosophers in vain so long have sought
In vain though by their powerful art they bind
Volatile Hermes and call up unbound
In various shapes old Proteus from the sea
Drained through a limbeck to his native form
What wonder then if fields and regions here
Breathe forth Elixir pure and rivers run
Potable gold when with one virtuous touch
The archchemick sun so far from us remote
Produces with terrestrial humour mixed
Here in the dark so many precious things
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
Undazzled far and wide his eye commands
For sight no obstacle found here nor shade
But all sunshine as when his beams at noon
Culminate from the equator as they now
Shot upward still direct whence no way round
Shadow from body opaque can fall and the air
No where so clear sharpened his visual ray
To objects distant far whereby he soon
Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand
The same whom John saw also in the sun
His back was turned but not his brightness hid
Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
Circled his head nor less his locks behind
Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
Lay waving round on some great charge employed
