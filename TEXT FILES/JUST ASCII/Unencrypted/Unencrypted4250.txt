South Africa Economy

Overview
    Many of the white oneseventh of the South African population enjoy incomes
    material comforts and health and educational standards equal to those of
    Western Europe In contrast most of the remaining population suffers from
    the poverty patterns of the Third World including unemployment lack of job
    skills and barriers to movement into higherpaying fields Inputs and
    outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments and
    the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international
    constraints on dealings with South Africa The main strength of the economy
    lies in its rich mineral resources which provide twothirds of exports
    Average growth of less than  in output in recent years falls far short of
    the  to  level needed to absorb some  new entrants to the labor
    force annually Economic developments in the s will be driven partly by
    the changing relations among the various ethnic groups
