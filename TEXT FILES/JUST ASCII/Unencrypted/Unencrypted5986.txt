Burundi Economy

Overview
    A landlocked resourcepoor country in an early stage of economic
    development Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
    industries Its economic health depends on the coffee crop which accounts
    for an average  of foreign exchange earnings each year The ability to
    pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
    climate and the international coffee market As part of its economic reform
    agenda launched in February  with IMF and World Bank support Burundi
    is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability and attract foreign
    investment in industry Several stateowned coffee companies were privatized
    via public auction in September

Cambodia Economy

Overview
    Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic development has been
    stymied by deadly political infighting The economy is based on agriculture
    and related industries Over the past decade Cambodia has been slowly
    recovering from its near destruction by war and political upheaval The food
    situation remains precarious during the s famine was averted only
    through international relief In  the production level of rice the
    staple food crop was able to meet only  of domestic needs The biggest
    success of the nations recovery program has been in new rubber plantings
    and in fishing Industry other than rice processing is almost nonexistent
    Foreign trade has been primarily with the former USSR and Vietnam and both
    trade and foreign aid are being adversely affected by the breakup of the
    USSR Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and unreliable
    Foreign aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has virtually stopped
