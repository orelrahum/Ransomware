Korea North Economy

Overview
    More than  of this command economy is socialized agricultural land is
    collectivized and stateowned industry produces  of manufactured goods
    State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist
    country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the
    strict rule of KIM Ilsong and his son KIM Chongil Economic growth during
    the period  averaged  but output declined by  annually
    during  largely because of disruptions in economic relations with
    the USSR Abundant natural resources and hydropower form the basis of
    industrial development Output of the extractive industries includes coal
    iron ore magnesite graphite copper zinc lead and precious metals
    Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry with light industry lagging far
    behind Despite the use of improved seed varieties expansion of irrigation
    and the heavy use of fertilizers North Korea has not yet become
    selfsufficient in food production Four consecutive years of poor harvests
    coupled with distribution problems have led to chronic food shortages
    North Korea remains far behind South Korea in economic development and
