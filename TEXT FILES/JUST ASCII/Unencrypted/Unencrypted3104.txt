Germany Economy

Overview
    The Federal Republic of Germany is making substantial progress in
    integrating and modernizing eastern Germany but at a heavy economic cost
    Western Germanys growth in  slowed to   the lowest rate since 
     because of slack world growth and higher interest rates and taxes required
    by the unification process While western Germanys economy was in recession
    in the last half of  eastern Germanys economy bottomed out after a
    nearly twoyear freefall and shows signs of recovery particularly in the
    construction transportation and service sectors Eastern Germany could
    begin a fragile recovery later concentrated in  in construction
    transportation and services The two regions remain vastly different
    however despite eastern Germanys progress Western Germany has an advanced
    market economy and is a world leader in exports It has a highly urbanized
    and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards abundant
    leisure time and comprehensive social welfare benefits Western Germany is
    relatively poor in natural resources coal being the most important mineral
    Western Germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically advanced
    goods The regions economy is mature services and manufacturing account
    for the dominant share of economic activity and raw materials and
    semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports In recent
    years manufacturing has accounted for about  of GDP with other sectors
    contributing lesser amounts Gross fixed investment in  accounted for
    about  of GDP In  GDP in the western region was an estimated
     per capita In contrast eastern Germanys economy is shedding the
    obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the Communist
    era Eastern Germanys share of allGerman GDP is only about  and eastern
    productivity is just  that of the west The privatization agency for
    eastern Germany the Treuhand is rapidly selling many of the  firms
    under its control The pace of private investment is starting to pick up
    but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain
    Eastern Germany has one of the worlds largest reserves of lowgrade lignite
    coal but little else in the way of mineral resources The quality of
    statistics from eastern Germany is improving yet many gaps remain the
    federal government began producing allGerman data for select economic
    statistics at the start of  The most challenging economic problem is
    promoting eastern Germanys economic reconstruction  specifically finding
    the right mix of fiscal monetary regulatory and tax policies that will
    spur investment in eastern Germany  without destabilizing western Germanys
    economy or damaging relations with West European partners The biggest
    danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could
    fuel inflation and prompt the German Central Bank the Bundesbank to keep a
    tight monetary policy to choke off a wageprice spiral Meanwhile the FRG
    has been providing billions of dollars to help the former Soviet republics
    and the reformist economies of Eastern Europe

Greece Economy

Overview
    Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic entrepreneurial
    system overlaid in  by a socialist government that enlarged the
    public sector from  of GDP in  to about  when Prime Minister
    Mitsotakis took office Tourism continues as a major industry and
    agriculture  although handicapped by geographic limitations and fragmented
    small farms  is selfsufficient except for meat dairy products and animal
    feedstuffs The Mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic
    problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations which
    had neglected the runaway budget deficit a ballooning current account
    deficit and accelerating inflation In early  the government secured a
     billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet
    imposed on a member country as the EC finally ran out of patience with
    Greeces failure to put its financial affairs in order Over the next three
    years Athens must bring inflation down to  cut the current account
    deficit and central government borrowing as a percentage of GDP slash
    publicsector employment by  curb publicsector pay raises and broaden
    the tax base
