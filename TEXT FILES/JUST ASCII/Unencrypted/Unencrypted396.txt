Uruguay Economy

Overview
    The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession of the early s
    In  real GDP grew by only  and in  by  The recovery was led
    by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors agriculture alone
    contributing  to GDP employing about  of the labor force and
    generating a large proportion of export earnings Raising livestock
    particularly cattle and sheep is the major agricultural activity In 
    domestic growth improved somewhat over  but various government factors
    including concentration on the external sector adverse weather conditions
    and greater attention to bringing down inflation and reducing the fiscal
    deficit kept output from expanding rapidly In a major step toward greater
    regional economic cooperation Uruguay joined Brazil Argentina and
    Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market Mercosur President
    LACALLE continues to press ahead with a broad economic reform plan to reduce
    state intervention in the economy but he faces strong opposition
