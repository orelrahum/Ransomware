Korea North Economy

Overview
    More than  of this command economy is socialized agricultural land is
    collectivized and stateowned industry produces  of manufactured goods
    State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist
    country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the
    strict rule of KIM Ilsong and his son KIM Chongil Economic growth during
    the period  averaged  but output declined by  annually
    during  largely because of disruptions in economic relations with
    the USSR Abundant natural resources and hydropower form the basis of
    industrial development Output of the extractive industries includes coal
    iron ore magnesite graphite copper zinc lead and precious metals
    Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry with light industry lagging far
    behind Despite the use of improved seed varieties expansion of irrigation
    and the heavy use of fertilizers North Korea has not yet become
    selfsufficient in food production Four consecutive years of poor harvests
    coupled with distribution problems have led to chronic food shortages

Kuwait Economy

Overview
    Up to the invasion by Iraq in August  the oil sector had dominated the
    economy Kuwait has the thirdlargest oil reserves in the world after Saudi
    Arabia and Iraq Earnings from hydrocarbons have generated over  of both
    export and government revenues and contributed about  to GDP Most of the
    nonoil sector has traditionally been dependent upon oilderived government
    revenues Iraqs destruction of Kuwaits oil industry during the Gulf war
    has devastated the economy Iraq destroyed or damaged more than  of
    Kuwaits  operating oil wells as well as sabotaged key surface
    facilities Firefighters brought all of the roughly  oil well fires and
    blowouts under control by November  By yearend production had been
    brought back to  barrels per day it could take two to three years to
    restore Kuwaits oil production to its prewar level of about  million
    barrels per day Meanwhile population had been greatly reduced because of
    the war from  million to  million
