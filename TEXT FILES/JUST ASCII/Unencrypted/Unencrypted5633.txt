South Africa Economy

Overview
    Many of the white oneseventh of the South African population enjoy incomes
    material comforts and health and educational standards equal to those of
    Western Europe In contrast most of the remaining population suffers from
    the poverty patterns of the Third World including unemployment lack of job
    skills and barriers to movement into higherpaying fields Inputs and
    outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments and
    the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international
    constraints on dealings with South Africa The main strength of the economy
    lies in its rich mineral resources which provide twothirds of exports
    Average growth of less than  in output in recent years falls far short of
    the  to  level needed to absorb some  new entrants to the labor
    force annually Economic developments in the s will be driven partly by
    the changing relations among the various ethnic groups

Sudan Economy

Overview
    Sudan is buffeted by civil war chronic political instability adverse
    weather high inflation and counterproductive economic policies The
    economy is dominated by governmental entities that account for more than 
    of new investment The private sectors main areas of activity are
    agriculture and trading with most private industrial investment predating
     The economys base is agriculture which employs  of the work
    force Industry mainly processes agricultural items Sluggish economic
    performance over the past decade attributable largely to declining annual
    rainfall has reduced levels of per capita income and consumption A high
    foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause difficulties In  the
    International Monetary Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan
    noncooperative because of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund Despite
    subsequent government efforts to implement reforms urged by the IMF and the
    World Bank the economy remained stagnant in FY as entrepreneurs lack the
    incentive to take economic risks
