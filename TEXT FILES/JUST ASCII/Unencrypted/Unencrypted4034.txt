navigation through multiple documents

Cornell currently is working to extend access to the digital library to
readers using workstations from their offices  This year is devoted to
the development of a network resident image conversion and delivery
server and client software that will support readers who use Apple
Macintosh computers IBM windows platforms and Sun workstations
Equipment for this development was provided by Sun Microsystems with
support from the Commission on Preservation and Access

During the showandtell session of the Workshop on Electronic Texts a
prototype view station will be demonstrated  In addition a display of
original library books that have been digitized will be available for
review with associated printed copies for comparison  The fifteenminute
overview of the project will include a slide presentation that
constitutes a "tour" of the preservation digitizing process

The final networkconnected version of the viewing station will provide
library users with another mechanism for accessing the digital library
and will also provide the capability of viewing images directly  This
will not require special software although a powerful computer with good
graphics will be needed

The Joint Study in Digital Preservation has generated a great deal of
interest in the library community  Unfortunately or perhaps
fortunately this project serves to raise a vast number of other issues
surrounding the use of digital technology for the preservation and use of
deteriorating library materials which subsequent projects will need to
examine  Much work remains

SESSION III

Howard BESSER                      Networking Multimedia Databases

What do we have to consider in building and distributing databases of
visual materials in a multiuser environment?  This presentation examines
a variety of concerns that need to be addressed before a multimedia
database can be set up in a networked environment

In the past it has not been feasible to implement databases of visual
materials in shareduser environments because of technological barriers
Each of the two basic models for multiuser multimedia databases has
posed its own problem  The analog multimedia storage model represented
by Project Athenas parallel analog and digital networks has required an
incredibly complex and expensive infrastructure  The economies of
scale that make multiuser setups cheaper per user served do not operate
in an environment that requires a computer workstation videodisc player
and two display devices for each user

The digital multimedia storage model has required vast amounts of storage
space as much as one gigabyte per thirty still images  In the past the
cost of such a large amount of storage space made this model a
prohibitive choice as well  But plunging storage costs are finally
making this second alternative viable

If storage no longer poses such an impediment what do we need to
consider in building digitally stored multiuser databases of visual
materials?  This presentation will examine the networking and
telecommunication constraints that must be overcome before such databases
can become commonplace and useful to a large number of people

The key problem is the vast size of multimedia documents and how this
affects not only storage but telecommunications transmission time
Anything slower than T speed is impractical for files of  megabyte or
larger which is likely to be small for a multimedia document  For
instance even on a  Kb line it would take three minutes to transfer a
megabyte file  And these figures assume ideal circumstances and do
not take into consideration other users contending for network bandwidth
disk access time or the time needed for remote display  Current common
telephone transmission rates would be completely impractical few users
would be willing to wait the hour necessary to transmit a single image at
 baud

This necessitates compression which itself raises a number of other
issues  In order to decrease file sizes significantly we must employ
lossy compression algorithms  But how much quality can we afford to
lose?  To date there has been only one significant study done of
imagequality needs for a particular user group and this study did not
look at loss resulting from compression  Only after identifying
imagequality needs can we begin to address storage and network bandwidth
needs

Experience with XWindowsbased applications such as Imagequery the
University of California at Berkeley image database demonstrates the
utility of a clientserver topology but also points to the limitation of
current software for a distributed environment  For example
applications like Imagequery can incorporate compression but current X
implementations do not permit decompression at the end users
workstation  Such decompression at the host computer alleviates storage
capacity problems while doing nothing to address problems of
telecommunications bandwidth

We need to examine the effects on network throughput of moving
multimedia documents around on a network  We need to examine various
topologies that will help us avoid bottlenecks around servers and
gateways  Experience with applications such as these raise still broader
questions How closely is the multimedia document tied to the software
for viewing it?  Can it be accessed and viewed from other applications?
Experience with the MARC format and more recently with the Z
protocols shows how useful it can be to store documents in a form in
which they can be accessed by a variety of application software

Finally from an intellectualaccess standpoint we need to address the
issue of providing access to these multimedia documents in
interdisciplinary environments  We need to examine terminology and
indexing strategies that will allow us to provide access to this material
in a crossdisciplinary way

Ronald LARSEN            Directions in HighPerformance Networking for
                         Libraries

The pace at which computing technology has advanced over the past forty
years shows no sign of abating  Roughly speaking each fiveyear period
has yielded an orderofmagnitude improvement in price and performance of
computing equipment  No fundamental hurdles are likely to prevent this
pace from continuing for at least the next decade  It is only in the
past five years though that computing has become ubiquitous in
libraries affecting all staff and patrons directly or indirectly

During these same five years communications rates on the Internet the
principal academic computing network have grown from  kbps to 
Mbps and the NSFNet backbone is now running  Mbps  Over the next five
years communication rates on the backbone are expected to exceed  Gbps
Growth in both the population of network users and the volume of network
traffic  has continued to grow geometrically at rates approaching 
percent per month  This flood of capacity and use likened by some to
"drinking from a firehose"  creates immense opportunities and challenges
for libraries  Libraries must anticipate the future implications of this
technology participate in its development and deploy it to ensure
access to the worlds information resources

The infrastructure for the information age is being put in place
Libraries face strategic decisions about their role in the development
deployment and use of this infrastructure  The emerging infrastructure
is much more than computers and communication lines  It is more than the
ability to compute at a remote site send electronic mail to a peer
across the country or move a file from one library to another  The next
five years will witness substantial development of the information
infrastructure of the network

In order to provide appropriate leadership library professionals must
have a fundamental understanding of and appreciation for computer
networking from local area networks to the National Research and
Education Network NREN  This presentation addresses these
fundamentals and how they relate to libraries today and in the near
future

Edwin BROWNRIGG               Electronic Library Visions and Realities

The electronic library has been a vision desired by manyand rejected by
somesince Vannevar Bush coined the term memex to describe an automated
intelligent personal information system  Variations on this vision have
included Ted Nelsons Xanadau Alan Kays Dynabook and Lancasters
"paperless library" with the most recent incarnation being the
"Knowledge Navigator" described by John Scully of Apple  But the reality
of library service has been less visionary and the leap to the electronic
library has eluded universities publishers and information technology
files

The Memex Research Institute MemRI an independent nonprofit research
and development organization has created an Electronic Library Program
of shared research and development in order to make the collective vision
more concrete  The program is working toward the creation of large
indexed publicly available electronic image collections of published
documents in academic special and public libraries  This strategic
plan is the result of the first stage of the program which has been an
investigation of the information technologies available to support such
an effort the economic parameters of electronic service compared to
traditional library operations and the business and political factors
affecting the shift from print distribution to electronic networked
access

The strategic plan envisions a combination of publicly searchable access
databases image and text document collections stored on network "file
servers" local and remote network access and an intellectual property
managementcontrol system  This combination of technology and
information content is defined in this plan as an Elibrary or Elibrary
collection  Some participating sponsors are already developing projects
based on MemRIs recommended directions

The Elibrary strategy projected in this plan is a visionary one that can
enable major changes and improvements in academic public and special
library service  This vision is though one that can be realized with
todays technology  At the same time it will challenge the political
and social structure within which libraries operate  in academic
libraries the traditional emphasis on local collections extending to
accreditation issues in public libraries the potential of electronic
branch and central libraries fully available to the public and for
special libraries new opportunities for shared collections and networks

The environment in which this strategic plan has been developed is at
the moment dominated by a sense of library limits  The continued
expansion and rapid growth of local academic library collections is now
clearly at an end  Corporate libraries and even law libraries are
faced with operating within a difficult economic climate as well as with
very active competition from commercial information sources  For
example public libraries may be seen as a desirable but not critical
municipal service in a time when the budgets of safety and health
agencies are being cut back

Further libraries in general have a very high labortocost ratio in
their budgets and labor costs are still increasing notwithstanding
automation investments  It is difficult for libraries to obtain capital
startup or seed funding for innovative activities and those
technologyintensive initiatives that offer the potential of decreased
labor costs can provoke the opposition of library staff

However libraries have achieved some considerable successes in the past
two decades by improving both their service and their credibility within
their organizationsand these positive changes have been accomplished
mostly with judicious use of information technologies  The advances in
computing and information technology have been wellchronicled  the
continuing precipitous drop in computing costs the growth of the
Internet and private networks and the explosive increase in publicly
available information databases

For example OCLC has become one of the largest computer network
organizations in the world by creating a cooperative cataloging network
of more than  libraries worldwide  Online public access catalogs
now serve millions of users on more than  dedicated terminals in
the United States alone  The University of California MELVYL online
catalog system has now expanded into an index database reference service
and supports more than six million searches a year  And libraries have
become the largest group of customers of CDROM publishing technology
more than  optical media publications such as those offered by
InfoTrac and Silver Platter are subscribed to by US libraries

This march of technology continues and in the next decade will result in
further innovations that are extremely difficult to predict  What is
clear is that libraries can now go beyond automation of their order files
and catalogs to automation of their collections themselvesand it is
possible to circumvent the fiscal limitations that appear to obtain
today

This Electronic Library Strategic Plan recommends a paradigm shift in
library service and demonstrates the steps necessary to provide improved
library services with limited capacities and operating investments

SESSION IVA

Anne KENNEY

The CornellXerox Joint Study in Digital Preservation resulted in the
recording of  brittle books as dpi digital images and the
production on demand of highquality and archivally sound paper
replacements  The project which was supported by the Commission on
Preservation and Access also investigated some of the issues surrounding
scanning storing retrieving and providing access to digital images in
a network environment

Anne Kenney will focus on some of the issues surrounding direct scanning
as identified in the Cornell Xerox Project  Among those to be discussed
are  image versus text capture indexing and access imagecapture
capabilities a comparison to photocopy and microfilm production and
cost analysis storage formats protocols and standards and the use of
this scanning technology for preservation purposes

The dpi digital images produced in the Cornell Xerox Project proved
highly acceptable for creating paper replacements of deteriorating
originals  The  scanned volumes provided an array of imagecapture
challenges that are common to nineteenthcentury printing techniques and
embrittled material and that defy the use of textconversion processes
These challenges include diminished contrast between text and background
fragile and deteriorated pages uneven printing elaborate type faces
faint and bold text adjacency handwritten text and annotations nonRoman
languages and a proliferation of illustrated material embedded in text
The latter category included highfrequency and lowfrequency halftones
continuous tone photographs intricate mathematical drawings maps
etchings reversepolarity drawings and engravings

The Xerox prototype scanning system provided a number of important
features for capturing this diverse material  Technicians used multiple
threshold settings filters line art and halftone definitions
autosegmentation windowing and softwareediting programs to optimize
image capture  At the same time this project focused on production
The goal was to make scanning as affordable and acceptable as
photocopying and microfilming for preservation reformatting  A
timeandcost study conducted during the last three months of this
project confirmed the economic viability of digital scanning and these
findings will be discussed here

From the outset the Cornell Xerox Project was predicated on the use of
nonproprietary standards and the use of common protocols when standards
did not exist  Digital files were created as TIFF images which were
compressed prior to storage using Group  CCITT compression  The Xerox
software is MS DOS based and utilizes offthe shelf programs such as
Microsoft Windows and Wang Image Wizard  The digital library is designed
to be hardwareindependent and to provide interchangeability with other
institutions through network connections  Access to the digital files
themselves is twotiered  Bibliographic records for the computer files
are created in RLIN and Cornells local system and access into the actual
digital images comprising a book is provided through a document control
structure and a networked image fileserver both of which will be
described

The presentation will conclude with a discussion of some of the issues
surrounding the use of this technology as a preservation tool storage
refreshing backup

Pamela ANDRE and Judith ZIDAR

The National Agricultural Library NAL has had extensive experience with
raster scanning of printed materials  Since  the Library has
participated in the National Agricultural Text Digitizing Project NATDP
a cooperative effort between NAL and fortyfive land grant university
libraries  An overview of the project will be presented giving its
history and NALs strategy for the future

An indepth discussion of NATDP will follow including a description of
the scanning process from the gathering of the printed materials to the
archiving of the electronic pages  The type of equipment required for a
standalone scanning workstation and the importance of file management
software will be discussed  Issues concerning the images themselves will
be addressed briefly such as image format black and white versus color
gray scale versus dithering and resolution

Also described will be a study currently in progress by NAL to evaluate
the usefulness of converting microfilm to electronic images in order to
improve access  With the cooperation of Tuskegee University NAL has
selected three reels of microfilm from a collection of sixtyseven reels
containing the papers letters and drawings of George Washington Carver
The three reels were converted into  electronic images using a
specialized microfilm scanner  The selection filming and indexing of
this material will be discussed

Donald WATERS

Project Open Book the Yale University Librarys effort to convert 
 books from microfilm to digital imagery is currently in an advanced
state of planning and organization  The Yale Library has selected a
major vendor to serve as a partner in the project and as systems
integrator  In its proposal the successful vendor helped isolate areas
of risk and uncertainty as well as key issues to be addressed during the
life of the project  The Yale Library is now poised to decide what
material it will convert to digital image form and to seek funding
initially for the first phase and then for the entire project

The proposal that Yale accepted for the implementation of Project Open
Book will provide at the end of three phases a conversion subsystem
browsing stations distributed on the campus network within the Yale
Library a subsystem for storing  books at  and  dots per
inch and network access to the image printers  Pricing for the system
implementation assumes the existence of Yales campus ethernet network
and its highspeed image printers and includes other requisite hardware
and software as well as system integration services  Proposed operating
costs include hardware and software maintenance but do not include
estimates for the facilities management of the storage devices and image
servers

Yale selected its vendor partner in a formal process partly funded by
the Commission for Preservation and Access  Following a request for
proposal the Yale Library selected two vendors as finalists to work with
Yale staff to generate a detailed analysis of requirements for Project
Open Book  Each vendor used the results of the requirements analysis to
generate and submit a formal proposal for the entire project  This
competitive process not only enabled the Yale Library to select its
primary vendor partner but also revealed much about the state of the
