Guyana Economy

Overview
    Guyana is one of the worlds poorest countries with a per capita income less
    than onefifth the South American average After growing on average at less
    than  a year in  GDP dropped by  a year in  The decline
    resulted from bad weather labor trouble in the canefields and flooding and
    equipment problems in the bauxite industry Consumer prices rose about 
    in  and  in  and the current account deficit widened
    substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell Moreover electric power is
    in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in national
    output The government in association with international financial
    agencies seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds The
    governments stabilization program  aimed at establishing realistic
    exchange rates reasonable price stability and a resumption of growth 
    requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience
    by consumers during a long incubation period In  buoyed by a recovery
    in mining and agriculture the economy posted  growth according to
    official figures A large volume of illegal and quasi legal economic
    activity is not captured in estimates of the countrys total output
