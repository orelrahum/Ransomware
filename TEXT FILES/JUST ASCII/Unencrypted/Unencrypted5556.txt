Chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste
With spattering noise rejected oft they assayed
Hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft
With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws
With soot and cinders filled so oft they fell
Into the same illusion not as Man
Whom they triumphed once lapsed  Thus were they plagued
And worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss
Till their lost shape permitted they resumed
Yearly enjoined some say to undergo
This annual humbling certain numbered days
To dash their pride and joy for Man seduced
However some tradition they dispersed
Among the Heathen of their purchase got
And fabled how the Serpent whom they called
Ophion with Eurynome the wide
Encroaching Eve perhaps had first the rule
Of high Olympus thence by Saturn driven
And Ops ere yet Dictaean Jove was born
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
Too soon arrived Sin there in power before
Once actual now in body and to dwell
Habitual habitant behind her Death
Close following pace for pace not mounted yet
On his pale horse to whom Sin thus began
Second of Satan sprung allconquering Death
What thinkest thou of our empire now though earned
With travel difficult not better far
Than still at Hells dark threshold to have sat watch
Unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved?
Whom thus the Sinborn monster answered soon
To me who with eternal famine pine
Alike is Hell or Paradise or Heaven
There best where most with ravine I may meet
Which here though plenteous all too little seems
To stuff this maw this vast unhidebound corps
To whom the incestuous mother thus replied
Thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flowers
Feed first on each beast next and fish and fowl
No homely morsels and whatever thing
The sithe of Time mows down devour unspared
Till I in Man residing through the race
