    agriculture dominates the economy generating about onethird of GDP and
    employing about twothirds of the working population Manufacturing which
    accounts for roughly  of GDP consists mainly of the processing of raw
    materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market Diamond mining
    provides an important source of hard currency The economy suffers from high
    unemployment rising inflation large trade deficits and a growing
    dependency on foreign assistance The government in  was attempting to
    get the budget deficit under control and in general to bring economic
    policy in line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank Since
    March  however military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and
    eastern Sierra Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined
    efforts to institute economic reforms
