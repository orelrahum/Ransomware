Congo Economy

Overview
    Congos economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts a
    beginning industrial sector based largely on oil supporting services and a
    government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing A reform
    program supported by the IMF and World Bank ran into difficulties in
     because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and
    a heavy debtservicing burden Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay
    of the economy providing about twothirds of government revenues and
    exports In the early s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to
    finance largescale development projects with growth averaging  annually
    one of the highest rates in Africa During the period  however
    growth has slowed to an average of roughly  annually only half the
    population growth rate
