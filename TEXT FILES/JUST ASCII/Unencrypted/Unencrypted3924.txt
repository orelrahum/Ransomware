Belarus Economy

Overview
    In many ways Belarus resembles the three Baltic states for example in its
    industrial competence its higherthanaverage standard of living and its
    critical dependence on the other former Soviet states for fuels and raw
    materials Belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former Soviet
    republics producing  of the total GDP and employing  of the labor
    force Once a mainly agricultural area it now supplies important producer
    and consumer goods  sometimes as the sole producer  to the other states
    The soil in Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine but by
    emphasizing favorable crops and livestock especially pigs and chickens
    Belarus has become a net exporter to the other republics of meat milk
    eggs flour and potatoes Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and
    gas and receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil
    pipeline and the Northern Lights gas pipeline These pipelines transit
    Belarus enroute to Eastern Europe Belarus produces petrochemicals
    plastics synthetic fibers nearly  of former Soviet output and
    fertilizer  of former Soviet output Raw material resources are limited
    to potash and peat deposits The peat more than onethird of the total for
    the former Soviet Union is used in domestic heating as boiler fuel for
    electric power stations and in the production of chemicals The potash
    supports fertilizer production
