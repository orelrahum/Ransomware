His flight precipitant and winds with ease
Through the pure marble air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable stars that shone
Stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds
Or other worlds they seemed or happy isles
Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old
Fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales
Thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there
He staid not to inquire  Above them all
The golden sun in splendour likest Heaven
Allured his eye thither his course he bends
Through the calm firmament but up or down
By center or eccentrick hard to tell
Or longitude where the great luminary
Aloof the vulgar constellations thick
That from his lordly eye keep distance due
Dispenses light from far they as they move
Their starry dance in numbers that compute
Days months and years towards his allcheering lamp
Turn swift their various motions or are turned
By his magnetick beam that gently warms
The universe and to each inward part
With gentle penetration though unseen
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep
So wonderously was set his station bright
There lands the Fiend a spot like which perhaps
