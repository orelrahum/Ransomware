Burundi Economy

Overview
    A landlocked resourcepoor country in an early stage of economic
    development Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
    industries Its economic health depends on the coffee crop which accounts
    for an average  of foreign exchange earnings each year The ability to
    pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
    climate and the international coffee market As part of its economic reform
    agenda launched in February  with IMF and World Bank support Burundi
