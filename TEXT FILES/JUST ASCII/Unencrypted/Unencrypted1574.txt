Indonesia Economy

Overview
    Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
    planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise
    Indonesia has extensive natural wealth yet with a large and rapidly
    increasing population it remains a poor country GDP growth in 
    averaged about  quite impressive but not sufficient to both slash
    underemployment and absorb the  million workers annually entering the
    labor force Agriculture including forestry and fishing is an important
    sector accounting for  of GDP and over  of the labor force The
    staple crop is rice Once the worlds largest rice importer Indonesia is
    now nearly selfsufficient Plantation crops  rubber and palm oil  and
    textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
    generation Industrial output now accounts for  of GDP and is based on a
    supply of diverse natural resources including crude oil natural gas
    timber metals and coal Of these the oil sector dominates the external
    economy generating more than  of the governments revenues and  of
    export earnings in  However the economys growth is highly dependent
    on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports Japan is Indonesias most
    important customer and supplier of aid In  rapid growth in the money
    supply prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy forcing the
    private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing Real
    interest rates remained above  offshore commercial debt grew and real
