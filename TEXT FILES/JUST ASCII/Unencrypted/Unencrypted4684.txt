GNPGDP methodology In the Economy section GNPGDP dollar estimates for
the OECD countries the former Soviet republics and the East European
countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP calculations rather
than from conversions at official currency exchange rates The PPP method
normally involves the use of international dollar price weights which are
applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy
In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries the
statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying identifying and allowing
for the quality of goods and services The division of a PPP GNPGDP estimate
in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP
conversion rate One thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods
in the US as one thousand dollars  converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate  will buy in the other country GNPGDP estimates for the
LDCs on the other hand are based on the conversion of GNPGDP estimates in
local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates One
caution the proportion of say defense expenditures as a percent of GNPGDP
in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when
GNPGDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms as for example when an observer
estimates the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures
similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency
exchange rate procedures Finally as academic research moves forward on the
PPP method we hope to convert all GNPGDP estimates to this method in future
