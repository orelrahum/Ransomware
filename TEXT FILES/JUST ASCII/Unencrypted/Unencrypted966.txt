engine made the disk seem an appealing vessel indeed  The overall
discussion suggested that the transition from CDROM to online networked
access may prove far slower and more difficult than has been anticipated


WHO ARE THE USERS AND WHAT DO THEY DO?

Although concerned with the technicalities of production the Workshop
never lost sight of the purposes and uses of electronic versions of
textual materials  As noted above those interested in imaging discussed
the problematical matter of digital preservation while the TEI proponents
described how machinereadable texts can be used in research  This latter
topic received thorough treatment in the paper read by Avra MICHELSON
She placed the phenomenon of electronic texts within the context of
broader trends in information technology and scholarly communication

Among other things MICHELSON described online conferences that
represent a vigorous and important intellectual forum for certain
disciplines  Internet now carries more than  conferences with about
 percent of these devoted to topics in the social sciences and the
humanities  Other scholars use online networks for "distance learning"
Meanwhile there has been a tremendous growth in enduser computing
professors today are less likely than their predecessors to ask the
campus computer center to process their data  Electronic texts are one
key to these sophisticated applications MICHELSON reported and more and
more scholars in the humanities now work in an online environment
Toward the end of the Workshop Michael LESK presented a corollary to
MICHELSONs talk reporting the results of an experiment that compared
the work of one group of chemistry students using traditional printed
texts and two groups using electronic sources  The experiment
demonstrated that in the event one does not know what to read one needs
the electronic systems the electronic systems hold no advantage at the
moment if one knows what to read but neither do they impose a penalty

DALY provided an anecdotal account of the revolutionizing impact of the
new technology on his previous methods of research in the field of classics
His account by extrapolation served to illustrate in part the arguments
made by MICHELSON concerning the positive effects of the sudden and radical
transformation being wrought in the ways scholars work

Susan VECCIA and Joanne FREEMAN delineated the use of electronic
materials outside the university  The most interesting aspect of their
use FREEMAN said could be seen as a paradox  teachers in elementary
and secondary schools requested access to primary source materials but
at the same time found that "primariness" itself made these materials
difficult for their students to use


OTHER TOPICS

Marybeth PETERS reviewed copyright law in the United States and offered
advice during a lively discussion of this subject  But uncertainty
remains concerning the price of copyright in a digital medium because a
solution remains to be worked out concerning management and synthesis of
copyrighted and outofcopyright pieces of a database

As moderator of the final session of the Workshop Prosser GIFFORD directed
discussion to future courses of action and the potential role of LC in
advancing them  Among the recommendations that emerged were the following

      Workshop participants should  begin to think about working
     with image material but structure and digitize it in such a
     way that at a later stage it can be interpreted into text and
      find a common way to build text and images together so that
     they can be used jointly at some stage in the future with
     appropriate network support because that is how users will want
     to access these materials  The Library might encourage attempts
     to bring together people who are working on texts and images

      A network version of American Memory should be developed or
     consideration should be given to making the data in it
     available to people interested in doing network multimedia
     Given the current dearth of digital data that is appealing and
     unencumbered by extremely complex rights problems developing a
     network version of American Memory could do much to help make
     network multimedia a reality

      Concerning the thorny issue of electronic deposit LC should
     initiate a catalytic process in terms of distributed
     responsibility that is bring together the distributed
     organizations and set up a study group to look at all the
     issues related to electronic deposit and see where we as a
     nation should move  For example LC might attempt to persuade
     one major library in each state to deal with its state
     equivalent publisher which might produce a cooperative project
     that would be equitably distributed around the country and one
     in which LC would be dealing with a minimal number of publishers
     and minimal copyright problems  LC must also deal with the
     concept of online publishing determining among other things
     how serials such as OJCCT might be deposited for copyright

      Since a number of projects are planning to carry out
     preservation by creating digital images that will end up in
     online or nearline storage at some institution LC might play
     a helpful role at least in the near term by accelerating how
     to catalog that information into the Research Library Information
     Network RLIN and then into OCLC so that it would be accessible
     This would reduce the possibility of multiple institutions digitizing
     the same work


CONCLUSION

The Workshop was valuable because it brought together partisans from
various groups and provided an occasion to compare goals and methods
The more committed partisans frequently communicate with others in their
groups but less often across group boundaries  The Workshop was also
valuable to attendeesincluding those involved with American Memorywho
came less committed to particular approaches or concepts  These
attendees learned a great deal and plan to select and employ elements of
imaging textcoding and networked distribution that suit their
respective projects and purposes

Still reality rears its ugly head  no breakthrough has been achieved
On the imaging side one confronts a proliferation of competing
datainterchange standards and a lack of consensus on the role of digital
facsimiles in preservation  In the realm of machinereadable texts one
encounters a reasonably mature standard but methodological difficulties
and high costs  These latter problems of course represent a special
impediment to the desire as it is sometimes expressed in the popular
press "to put the contents of the Library of Congress on line"  In
the words of one participant there was "no solution to the economic
problemsthe projects that are out there are surviving but it is going
to be a lot of work to transform the information industry and so far the
investment to do that is not forthcoming" LESK per litteras

GIFFORD  Origin of Workshop in current Librarians desire to make LCs
collections more widely available  Desiderata arising from the prospect
of greater interconnectedness 


After welcoming participants on behalf of the Library of Congress
American Memory AM and the National Demonstration Lab Prosser
GIFFORD director for scholarly programs Library of Congress located
the origin of the Workshop on Electronic Texts in a conversation he had
had considerably more than a year ago with Carl FLEISCHHAUER concerning
some of the issues faced by AM  On the assumption that numerous other
people were asking the same questions the decision was made to bring
together as many of these people as possible to ask the same questions
together  In a deeper sense GIFFORD said the origin of the Workshop
lay in the desire of the current Librarian of Congress James H
Billington to make the collections of the Library especially those
offering unique or unusual testimony on aspects of the American
experience available to a much wider circle of users than those few
people who can come to Washington to use them  This meant that the
emphasis of AM from the outset has been on archival collections of the
basic material and on making these collections themselves available
rather than selected or heavily edited products

From AMs emphasis followed the questions with which the Workshop began
who will use these materials and in what form will they wish to use
them  But an even larger issue deserving mention in GIFFORDs view was
the phenomenal growth in Internet connectivity  He expressed the hope
that the prospect of greater interconnectedness than ever before would
lead to   much more cooperative and mutually supportive endeavors 
development of systems of shared and distributed responsibilities to
avoid duplication and to ensure accuracy and preservation of unique
materials and  agreement on the necessary standards and development of
the appropriate directories and indices to make navigation
straightforward among the varied resources that are and increasingly
will be available  In this connection GIFFORD requested that
participants reflect from the outset upon the sorts of outcomes they
thought the Workshop might have  Did those present constitute a group
with sufficient common interests to propose a next step or next steps
and if so what might those be?  They would return to these questions the
following afternoon

                                 


FLEISCHHAUER  Core of Workshop concerns preparation and production of
materials  Special challenge in conversion of textual materials 
Quality versus quantity  Do the several groups represented share common
interests? 


Carl FLEISCHHAUER coordinator American Memory Library of Congress
emphasized that he would attempt to represent the people who perform some
of the work of converting or preparing  materials and that the core of
the Workshop had to do with preparation and production  FLEISCHHAUER
then drew a distinction between the long term when many things would be
available and connected in the ways that GIFFORD described and the short
term in which AM not only has wrestled with the issue of what is the
best course to pursue but also has faced a variety of technical
challenges

FLEISCHHAUER remarked AMs endeavors to deal with a wide range of library
formats such as motion picture collections soundrecording collections
and pictorial collections of various sorts especially collections of
photographs  In the course of these efforts AM kept coming back to
textual materialsmanuscripts or rare printed matter bound materials
etc  Text posed the greatest conversion challenge of all  Thus the
genesis of the Workshop which reflects the problems faced by AM  These
problems include physical problems  For example those in the library
and archive business deal with collections made up of fragile and rare
manuscript items bound materials especially the notoriously brittle
bound materials of the late nineteenth century  These are precious
cultural artifacts however as well as interesting sources of
information and LC desires to retain and conserve them  AM needs to
handle things without damaging them  Guillotining a book to run it
through a sheet feeder must be avoided at all costs

Beyond physical problems issues pertaining to quality arose  For
example the desire to provide users with a searchable text is affected
by the question of acceptable level of accuracy  One hundred percent
accuracy is tremendously expensive  On the other hand the output of
optical character recognition OCR can be tremendously inaccurate
Although AM has attempted to find a middle ground uncertainty persists
as to whether or not it has discovered the right solution

Questions of quality arose concerning images as well  FLEISCHHAUER
contrasted the extremely high level of quality of the digital images in
the Cornell Xerox Project with AMs efforts to provide a browsequality
or accessquality image as opposed to an archival or preservation image
FLEISCHHAUER therefore welcomed the opportunity to compare notes

FLEISCHHAUER observed in passing that conversations he had had about
networks have begun to signal that for various forms of media a
determination may be made that there is a browsequality item or a
distributionandaccessquality item that may coexist in some systems
with a higher quality archival item that would be inconvenient to send
through the network because of its size  FLEISCHHAUER referred of
course to images more than to searchable text

As AM considered those questions several conceptual issues arose  ought
AM occasionally to reproduce materials entirely through an image set at
other times entirely through a text set and in some cases a mix?
There probably would be times when the historical authenticity of an
artifact would require that its image be used  An image might be
desirable as a recourse for users if one could not provide percent
accurate text  Again AM wondered as a practical matter if a
distinction could be drawn between rare printed matter that might exist
in multiple collectionsthat is in ten or fifteen libraries  In such
cases the need for perfect reproduction would be less than for unique
items  Implicit in his remarks FLEISCHHAUER conceded was the admission
that AM has been tilting strongly towards quantity and drawing back a
little from perfect quality  That is it seemed to AM that society would
be better served if more things were distributed by LCeven if they were
not quite perfectthan if fewer things perfectly represented were
distributed  This was stated as a proposition to be tested with
responses to be gathered from users

In thinking about issues related to reproduction of materials and seeing
other people engaged in parallel activities AM deemed it useful to
convene a conference  Hence the Workshop  FLEISCHHAUER thereupon
surveyed the several groups represented   the world of images image
users and image makers  the world of text and scholarship and within
this group those concerned with languageFLEISCHHAUER confessed to finding
delightful irony in the fact that some of the most advanced thinkers on
computerized texts are those dealing with ancient Greek and Roman materials
 the network world and  the general world of library science which
includes people interested in preservation and cataloging

FLEISCHHAUER concluded his remarks with special thanks to the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation for its support of the meeting the American
Memory group the Office for Scholarly Programs the National
Demonstration Lab and the Office of Special Events  He expressed the
hope that David Woodley Packard might be able to attend noting that
Packards work and the work of the foundation had sponsored a number of
projects in the text area

Serving as moderator James DALY acknowledged the generosity of all the
presenters for giving of their time counsel and patience in planning
the Workshop as well as of members of the American Memory project and
other Library of Congress staff and the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation and its executive director Colburn S Wilbur
