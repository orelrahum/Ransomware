    accounts for onethird of industrial output Industry including sugar
    milling contributes  to GDP Fiji traditionally had earned considerable
    sums of hard currency from the  tourists who visited each year In
     however after two military coups the economy went into decline GDP
    dropped by  in  and by another  in  political uncertainty
    created a drop in tourism and the worst drought of the century caused sugar
    production to fall sharply In contrast sugar and tourism turned in strong
    performances in  and the economy rebounded vigorously In  the
    economy received a setback from cyclone Sina which cut sugar output by an

Finland Economy

Overview
    Finland has a highly industrialized largely free market economy with per
    capita output nearly threefourths the US figure Its main economic force is
    the manufacturing sector  principally the wood metals and engineering
    industries Trade is important with the export of goods representing about
     of GDP Except for timber and several minerals Finland depends on
    imported raw materials energy and some components of manufactured goods
    Because of the climate agricultural development is limited to maintaining
    selfsufficiency in basic commodities The economy which experienced an
    average of  annual growth between  and  sank into a deep
    recession in  as growth contracted by  The recession  which is
    expected to bottom out in late   has been caused by economic
    overheating depressed foreign markets and the dismantling of the barter
    system between Finland and the former Soviet Union in which Soviet oil and
    gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods The Finnish
    Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and
    efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets cuts in public
    expenditures partial privatization of state enterprises and foreign
    investment and exchange liberalization Helsinki tied the markkaa to the
    ECs European Currency Unit to promote stability but was forced to devalue
    the markkaa by about  in November  The devaluation should improve
    industrial competitiveness and business confidence in  Finland as a
    member of EFTA negotiated a European Economic Area arrangement with the EC
    that allows for free movement of capital goods services and labor within
    the organization as of January  Finland applied for full EC membership
