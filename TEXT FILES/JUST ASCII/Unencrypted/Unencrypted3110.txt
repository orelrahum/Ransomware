Hungary Economy

Overview
    Hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition between a command and a
    market economy Agriculture is an important sector providing sizable export
    earnings and meeting domestic food needs Industry accounts for about  of
    GDP and  of employment Hungary claims that less than  of foreign
    trade is now with former CEMA countries while about  is with OECD
    members Hungarys economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it
    a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment
    In  Hungary received half of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe
    and in  received the largest single share The growing private sector
    accounts for onequarter to onethird of national output according to
    unofficial estimates Privatization of state enterprises is progressing
    although excessive redtape bureaucratic oversight and uncertainties about
    pricing have slowed the process Escalating unemployment and high rates of
    inflation may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform
    while Hungarys heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to
    introduce full convertability of the forint before

Iceland Economy

Overview
    Icelands prosperous Scandinaviantype economy is basically capitalistic
    but with extensive welfare measures low unemployment and comparatively
    even distribution of income The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry which provides nearly  of export earnings In the absence of
    other natural resources Icelands economy is vulnerable to changing world
    fish prices The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
    in  and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
    plant The conservative governments economic priorities include reducing
    the budget and current account deficits containing inflation revising
    agricultural and fishing policies diversifying the economy and tying the
    krona to the ECs European currency unit in  The fishing industries 
    notably the shrimp industry  are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
    mergers Inflation has continued to drop sharply from  in  to about
     in  and possibly  in  while unemployment is expected to
    increase to  GDP is expected to contract by nearly  in

India Economy

Overview
    Indias economy is a mixture of traditional village farming and handicrafts
    modern agriculture old and new branches of industry and a multitude of
    support services It presents both the entrepreneurial skills and drives of
    the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the
    socialist mold Growth of  annually in the s has softened the impact
    of population growth on unemployment social tranquility and the
    environment Agricultural output has continued to expand reflecting the
    greater use of modern farming techniques and improved seed that have helped
    to make India selfsufficient in food grains and a net agricultural
    exporter However tens of millions of villagers particularly in the south
    have not benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty and
    great numbers of urban residents lack the basic essentials of life Industry
    has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls The growth rate of
    the service sector has also been strong India however has been challenged
    more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves higher inflation and
    a large debt service burden

Indian Ocean Economy

Overview
    The Indian Ocean provides a major highway for the movement of petroleum
    products from the Middle East to Europe and North and South American
    countries Fish from the ocean are of growing economic importance to many of
    the bordering countries as a source of both food and exports Fishing fleets
    from Russia Japan Korea and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean mainly
    for shrimp and tuna Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the
    offshore areas of Saudi Arabia Iran India and Western Australia An
    estimated  of the worlds offshore oil production comes from the Indian
    Ocean Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are
    actively exploited by bordering countries particularly India South Africa
    Indonesia Sri Lanka and Thailand
Industries
    based on exploitation of natural resources particularly marine life
    minerals oil and gas production fishing sand and gravel aggregates

Indonesia Economy

Overview
    Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
    planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise
    Indonesia has extensive natural wealth yet with a large and rapidly
    increasing population it remains a poor country GDP growth in 
    averaged about  quite impressive but not sufficient to both slash
    underemployment and absorb the  million workers annually entering the
    labor force Agriculture including forestry and fishing is an important
    sector accounting for  of GDP and over  of the labor force The
    staple crop is rice Once the worlds largest rice importer Indonesia is
    now nearly selfsufficient Plantation crops  rubber and palm oil  and
    textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
    generation Industrial output now accounts for  of GDP and is based on a
    supply of diverse natural resources including crude oil natural gas
    timber metals and coal Of these the oil sector dominates the external
    economy generating more than  of the governments revenues and  of
    export earnings in  However the economys growth is highly dependent
    on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports Japan is Indonesias most
    important customer and supplier of aid In  rapid growth in the money
    supply prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy forcing the
    private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing Real
    interest rates remained above  offshore commercial debt grew and real
