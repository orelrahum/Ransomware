Left for repentance none for pardon left?
None left but by submission and that word
Disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
Among the Spirits beneath whom I seduced
With other promises and other vaunts
Than to submit boasting I could subdue
The Omnipotent  Ay me they little know
How dearly I abide that boast so vain
Under what torments inwardly I groan
While they adore me on the throne of Hell
With diadem and scepter high advanced
The lower still I fall only supreme
In misery  Such joy ambition finds
But say I could repent and could obtain
By act of grace my former state how soon
Would highth recall high thoughts how soon unsay
What feigned submission swore?  Ease would recant
Vows made in pain as violent and void
For never can true reconcilement grow
Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
And heavier fall  so should I purchase dear
Short intermission bought with double smart
This knows my Punisher therefore as far
From granting he as I from begging peace
All hope excluded thus behold in stead
Mankind created and for him this world
So farewell hope and with hope farewell fear
Farewell remorse all good to me is lost
Evil be thou my good by thee at least
Divided empire with Heavens King I hold
By thee and more than half perhaps will reign
As Man ere long and this new world shall know
Thus while he spake each passion dimmed his face
Thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair
Which marred his borrowed visage and betrayed
Him counterfeit if any eye beheld
For heavenly minds from such distempers foul
Are ever clear  Whereof he soon aware
Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm
Artificer of fraud and was the first
That practised falsehood under saintly show
Deep malice to conceal couched with revenge
Yet not enough had practised to deceive
Uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down
 The way he went and on the Assyrian mount
 Saw him disfigured more than could befall
 Spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce
 He marked and mad demeanour then alone
 As he supposed all unobserved unseen
 So on he fares and to the border comes
 Of Eden where delicious Paradise
 Now nearer crowns with her enclosure green
 As with a rural mound the champaign head
 Of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides
Access denied and overhead upgrew
 Insuperable height of loftiest shade
 Cedar and pine and fir and branching palm
 A sylvan scene and as the ranks ascend
 Shade above shade a woody theatre
 Of stateliest view Yet higher than their tops
 The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung

    
Which to our general sire gave prospect large
Into his nether empire neighbouring round
And higher than that wall a circling row
Of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit
Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue
Appeared with gay enamelled colours mixed
On which the sun more glad impressed his beams
Than in fair evening cloud or humid bow
When God hath showered the earth so lovely seemed
That landskip  And of pure now purer air
Meets his approach and to the heart inspires
Vernal delight and joy able to drive
All sadness but despair  Now gentle gales
Fanning their odoriferous wings dispense
Native perfumes and whisper whence they stole
Those balmy spoils  As when to them who fail
Beyond the Cape of Hope and now are past
Mozambick off at sea northeast winds blow
Sabean odours from the spicy shore
Of Araby the blest with such delay
Well pleased they slack their course and many a league
Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles
So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend
Who came their bane though with them better pleased
Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume
That drove him though enamoured from the spouse
Of Tobits son and with a vengeance sent
From Media post to Egypt there fast bound
Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill
Satan had journeyed on pensive and slow
But further way found none so thick entwined
As one continued brake the undergrowth
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed
All path of man or beast that passed that way
One gate there only was and that looked east
On the other side which when the archfelon saw
Due entrance he disdained and in contempt
At one flight bound high overleaped all bound
Of hill or highest wall and sheer within
Lights on his feet  As when a prowling wolf
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey
Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve
In hurdled cotes amid the field secure
Leaps oer the fence with ease into the fold
Or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash
Of some rich burgher whose substantial doors
Crossbarred and bolted fast fear no assault
In at the window climbs or oer the tiles
So clomb this first grand thief into Gods fold
So since into his church lewd hirelings climb
Thence up he flew and on the tree of life
The middle tree and highest there that grew
Sat like a cormorant yet not true life
Thereby regained but sat devising death
To them who lived nor on the virtue thought
Of that lifegiving plant but only used
For prospect what well used had been the pledge
Of immortality  So little knows
Any but God alone to value right
The good before him but perverts best things
To worst abuse or to their meanest use
Beneath him with new wonder now he views
To all delight of human sense exposed
In narrow room Natures whole wealth yea more
A Heaven on Earth  For blissful Paradise
Of God the garden was by him in the east
Of Eden planted Eden stretched her line
From Auran eastward to the royal towers
Of great Seleucia built by Grecian kings
Of where the sons of Eden long before
Dwelt in Telassar  In this pleasant soil
His far more pleasant garden God ordained
Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
All trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste
And all amid them stood the tree of life
High eminent blooming ambrosial fruit
Of vegetable gold and next to life
Our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by
Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill
Southward through Eden went a river large
Nor changed his course but through the shaggy hill
Passed underneath ingulfed for God had thrown
That mountain as his gardenmould high raised
Upon the rapid current which through veins
Of porous earth with kindly thirst updrawn
Rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill
Watered the garden thence united fell
Down the steep glade and met the nether flood
Which from his darksome passage now appears
And now divided into four main streams
Runs diverse wandering many a famous realm
And country whereof here needs no account
But rather to tell how if Art could tell
How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks
Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold
With mazy errour under pendant shades
Ran nectar visiting each plant and fed
Flowers worthy of Paradise which not nice Art
In beds and curious knots but Nature boon
Poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain
Both where the morning sun first warmly smote
The open field and where the unpierced shade
Imbrowned the noontide bowers  Thus was this place
A happy rural seat of various view
Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm
Others whose fruit burnished with golden rind
Hung amiable Hesperian fables true
If true here only and of delicious taste
Betwixt them lawns or level downs and flocks
Grazing the tender herb were interposed
Or palmy hillock or the flowery lap
Of some irriguous valley spread her store
Flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose
Another side umbrageous grots and caves
Of cool recess oer which the mantling vine
Lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps
Luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall
Down the slope hills dispersed or in a lake
That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
Her crystal mirrour holds unite their streams
The birds their quire apply airs vernal airs
Breathing the smell of field and grove attune
The trembling leaves while universal Pan
Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance
Led on the eternal Spring  Not that fair field
