Peru Economy

Overview
    The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented with a large
    dose of government ownership remaining in mining energy and banking In
    the s the economy suffered from hyperinflation declining per capita
    output and mounting external debt Peru was shut off from IMF and World
    Bank support in the mids because of its huge debt arrears An austerity
    program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in
    July  contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
    activity but the slide halted late in the year and output rose  in
     After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
    government price subsidies monthly price increases eased to the
    singledigit level and by December  dropped to the lowest increase since
    mid Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
    in September  and although it faces  billion in arrears on its
    external debt is working to pay some  billion of these to the IMF and
    World Bank by
