Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
Beneath the Azores whether the prime orb
Incredible how swift had thither rolled
Diurnal or this less volubil earth
By shorter flight to the east had left him there
Arraying with reflected purple and gold
The clouds that on his western throne attend
Now came still Evening on and Twilight gray
Had in her sober livery all things clad
Silence accompanied for beast and bird
They to their grassy couch these to their nests
Were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale
She all night long her amorous descant sung
Silence was pleased  Now glowed the firmament
With living sapphires  Hesperus that led
The starry host rode brightest till the moon
Rising in clouded majesty at length
Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light
And oer the dark her silver mantle threw
When Adam thus to Eve  Fair Consort the hour
Of night and all things now retired to rest
Mind us of like repose since God hath set
Labour and rest as day and night to men
Successive and the timely dew of sleep
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
Our eyelids  Other creatures all day long
Rove idle unemployed and less need rest
Man hath his daily work of body or mind
Appointed which declares his dignity
And the regard of Heaven on all his ways
While other animals unactive range
And of their doings God takes no account
Tomorrow ere fresh morning streak the east
With first approach of light we must be risen
And at our pleasant labour to reform
Yon flowery arbours yonder alleys green
Our walk at noon with branches overgrown
That mock our scant manuring and require
More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth
Those blossoms also and those dropping gums
That lie bestrown unsightly and unsmooth
Ask riddance if we mean to tread with ease
Mean while as Nature wills night bids us rest
To whom thus Eve with perfect beauty adorned
My Author and Disposer what thou bidst
Unargued I obey  So God ordains
God is thy law thou mine  To know no more
Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise
With thee conversing I forget all time
All seasons and their change all please alike
Sweet is the breath of Morn her rising sweet
With charm of earliest birds  pleasant the sun
When first on this delightful land he spreads
His orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower
Glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth
After soft showers and sweet the coming on
Of grateful Evening mild then silent Night
With this her solemn bird and this fair moon
And these the gems of Heaven her starry train
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends
With charm of earliest birds nor rising sun
On this delightful land nor herb fruit flower
Glistering with dew nor fragrance after showers
Nor grateful Evening mild nor silent Night
With this her solemn bird nor walk by moon
Or glittering starlight without thee is sweet
But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom
This glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes?
To whom our general ancestor replied
Daughter of God and Man accomplished Eve
These have their course to finish round the earth
By morrow evening and from land to land
In order though to nations yet unborn
Ministring light prepared they set and rise
Lest total Darkness should by night regain
Her old possession and extinguish life
In Nature and all things which these soft fires
Not only enlighten but with kindly heat
Of various influence foment and warm
Temper or nourish or in part shed down
Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
On earth made hereby apter to receive
Perfection from the suns more potent ray
These then though unbeheld in deep of night
Shine not in vain nor think though men were none
That Heaven would want spectators God want praise
Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
Unseen both when we wake and when we sleep
All these with ceaseless praise his works behold
Both day and night  How often from the steep
Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
Celestial voices to the midnight air
Sole or responsive each to others note
Singing their great Creator? oft in bands
While they keep watch or nightly rounding walk
With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds
