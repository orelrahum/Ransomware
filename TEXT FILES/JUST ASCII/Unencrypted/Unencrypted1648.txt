     to catalog that information into the Research Library Information
     Network RLIN and then into OCLC so that it would be accessible
     This would reduce the possibility of multiple institutions digitizing
     the same work


CONCLUSION

The Workshop was valuable because it brought together partisans from
various groups and provided an occasion to compare goals and methods
The more committed partisans frequently communicate with others in their
groups but less often across group boundaries  The Workshop was also
valuable to attendeesincluding those involved with American Memorywho
came less committed to particular approaches or concepts  These
attendees learned a great deal and plan to select and employ elements of
imaging textcoding and networked distribution that suit their
respective projects and purposes

Still reality rears its ugly head  no breakthrough has been achieved
On the imaging side one confronts a proliferation of competing
datainterchange standards and a lack of consensus on the role of digital
facsimiles in preservation  In the realm of machinereadable texts one
encounters a reasonably mature standard but methodological difficulties
and high costs  These latter problems of course represent a special
impediment to the desire as it is sometimes expressed in the popular
press "to put the contents of the Library of Congress on line"  In
the words of one participant there was "no solution to the economic
problemsthe projects that are out there are surviving but it is going
to be a lot of work to transform the information industry and so far the
investment to do that is not forthcoming" LESK per litteras

GIFFORD  Origin of Workshop in current Librarians desire to make LCs
collections more widely available  Desiderata arising from the prospect
of greater interconnectedness 


After welcoming participants on behalf of the Library of Congress
American Memory AM and the National Demonstration Lab Prosser
GIFFORD director for scholarly programs Library of Congress located
the origin of the Workshop on Electronic Texts in a conversation he had
had considerably more than a year ago with Carl FLEISCHHAUER concerning
some of the issues faced by AM  On the assumption that numerous other
people were asking the same questions the decision was made to bring
together as many of these people as possible to ask the same questions
together  In a deeper sense GIFFORD said the origin of the Workshop
lay in the desire of the current Librarian of Congress James H
Billington to make the collections of the Library especially those
offering unique or unusual testimony on aspects of the American
experience available to a much wider circle of users than those few
people who can come to Washington to use them  This meant that the
emphasis of AM from the outset has been on archival collections of the
basic material and on making these collections themselves available
rather than selected or heavily edited products

From AMs emphasis followed the questions with which the Workshop began
who will use these materials and in what form will they wish to use
them  But an even larger issue deserving mention in GIFFORDs view was
the phenomenal growth in Internet connectivity  He expressed the hope
that the prospect of greater interconnectedness than ever before would
lead to   much more cooperative and mutually supportive endeavors 
development of systems of shared and distributed responsibilities to
avoid duplication and to ensure accuracy and preservation of unique
materials and  agreement on the necessary standards and development of
the appropriate directories and indices to make navigation
straightforward among the varied resources that are and increasingly
will be available  In this connection GIFFORD requested that
participants reflect from the outset upon the sorts of outcomes they
thought the Workshop might have  Did those present constitute a group
with sufficient common interests to propose a next step or next steps
and if so what might those be?  They would return to these questions the
following afternoon

                                 


FLEISCHHAUER  Core of Workshop concerns preparation and production of
materials  Special challenge in conversion of textual materials 
Quality versus quantity  Do the several groups represented share common
interests? 


Carl FLEISCHHAUER coordinator American Memory Library of Congress
emphasized that he would attempt to represent the people who perform some
of the work of converting or preparing  materials and that the core of
the Workshop had to do with preparation and production  FLEISCHHAUER
then drew a distinction between the long term when many things would be
available and connected in the ways that GIFFORD described and the short
term in which AM not only has wrestled with the issue of what is the
best course to pursue but also has faced a variety of technical
challenges

FLEISCHHAUER remarked AMs endeavors to deal with a wide range of library
formats such as motion picture collections soundrecording collections
and pictorial collections of various sorts especially collections of
photographs  In the course of these efforts AM kept coming back to
textual materialsmanuscripts or rare printed matter bound materials
etc  Text posed the greatest conversion challenge of all  Thus the
genesis of the Workshop which reflects the problems faced by AM  These
problems include physical problems  For example those in the library
and archive business deal with collections made up of fragile and rare
manuscript items bound materials especially the notoriously brittle
bound materials of the late nineteenth century  These are precious
cultural artifacts however as well as interesting sources of
information and LC desires to retain and conserve them  AM needs to
handle things without damaging them  Guillotining a book to run it
through a sheet feeder must be avoided at all costs

Beyond physical problems issues pertaining to quality arose  For
example the desire to provide users with a searchable text is affected
by the question of acceptable level of accuracy  One hundred percent
accuracy is tremendously expensive  On the other hand the output of
optical character recognition OCR can be tremendously inaccurate
Although AM has attempted to find a middle ground uncertainty persists
as to whether or not it has discovered the right solution

Questions of quality arose concerning images as well  FLEISCHHAUER
contrasted the extremely high level of quality of the digital images in
the Cornell Xerox Project with AMs efforts to provide a browsequality
or accessquality image as opposed to an archival or preservation image
FLEISCHHAUER therefore welcomed the opportunity to compare notes

FLEISCHHAUER observed in passing that conversations he had had about
networks have begun to signal that for various forms of media a
determination may be made that there is a browsequality item or a
distributionandaccessquality item that may coexist in some systems
with a higher quality archival item that would be inconvenient to send
through the network because of its size  FLEISCHHAUER referred of
course to images more than to searchable text

As AM considered those questions several conceptual issues arose  ought
AM occasionally to reproduce materials entirely through an image set at
other times entirely through a text set and in some cases a mix?
There probably would be times when the historical authenticity of an
artifact would require that its image be used  An image might be
desirable as a recourse for users if one could not provide percent
accurate text  Again AM wondered as a practical matter if a
distinction could be drawn between rare printed matter that might exist
in multiple collectionsthat is in ten or fifteen libraries  In such
cases the need for perfect reproduction would be less than for unique
items  Implicit in his remarks FLEISCHHAUER conceded was the admission
that AM has been tilting strongly towards quantity and drawing back a
little from perfect quality  That is it seemed to AM that society would
be better served if more things were distributed by LCeven if they were
not quite perfectthan if fewer things perfectly represented were
distributed  This was stated as a proposition to be tested with
responses to be gathered from users

In thinking about issues related to reproduction of materials and seeing
other people engaged in parallel activities AM deemed it useful to
convene a conference  Hence the Workshop  FLEISCHHAUER thereupon
surveyed the several groups represented   the world of images image
users and image makers  the world of text and scholarship and within
this group those concerned with languageFLEISCHHAUER confessed to finding
delightful irony in the fact that some of the most advanced thinkers on
computerized texts are those dealing with ancient Greek and Roman materials
 the network world and  the general world of library science which
includes people interested in preservation and cataloging

FLEISCHHAUER concluded his remarks with special thanks to the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation for its support of the meeting the American
Memory group the Office for Scholarly Programs the National
Demonstration Lab and the Office of Special Events  He expressed the
hope that David Woodley Packard might be able to attend noting that
Packards work and the work of the foundation had sponsored a number of
projects in the text area

                                 

SESSION I  CONTENT IN A NEW FORM   WHO WILL USE IT AND WHAT WILL THEY DO?


DALY  Acknowledgements  A new Latin authors disk   Effects of the new
technology on previous methods of research 


Serving as moderator James DALY acknowledged the generosity of all the
presenters for giving of their time counsel and patience in planning
the Workshop as well as of members of the American Memory project and
other Library of Congress staff and the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation and its executive director Colburn S Wilbur

DALY then recounted his visit in March to the Center for Electronic Texts
in the Humanities CETH and the Department of Classics at Rutgers
University where an old friend Lowell Edmunds introduced him to the
departments IBYCUS scholarly personal computer and in particular the
new Latin CDROM containing among other things almost all classical
Latin literary texts through AD   Packard Humanities Institute
PHI Los Altos California released this disk late in  with a
nominal triennial licensing fee

Playing with the disk for an hour or so at Rutgers brought home to DALY
at once the revolutionizing impact of the new technology on his previous
methods of research  Had this disk been available two or three years
earlier DALY contended when he was engaged in preparing a commentary on
Book  of Virgils Aeneid for Cambridge University Press he would not
have required a fortyeightsquarefoot table on which to spread the
numerous most frequently consulted items including some ten or twelve
concordances to key Latin authors an almost equal number of lexica to
authors who lacked concordances and where either lexica or concordances
were lacking numerous editions of authors antedating and postdating Virgil

Nor when checking each of the average six to seven words contained in
the Virgilian hexameter for its usage elsewhere in Virgils works or
other Latin authors would DALY have had to maintain the laborious
mechanical process of flipping through these concordances lexica and
editions each time  Nor would he have had to frequent as often the
Milton S Eisenhower Library at the Johns Hopkins University to consult
the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae  Instead of devoting countless hours or
the bulk of his research time to gathering data concerning Virgils use
of words DALYnow freed by PHIs Latin authors disk from the
tyrannical yet in some ways paradoxically happy scholarly drudgery
would have been able to devote that same bulk of time to analyzing and
interpreting Virgilian verbal usage

Citing Theodore Brunner Gregory Crane Elli MYLONAS and Avra MICHELSON
DALY argued that this reversal in his style of work made possible by the
new technology would perhaps have resulted in better more productive
research  Indeed even in the course of his browsing the Latin authors
disk at Rutgers its powerful search retrieval and highlighting
capabilities suggested to him several new avenues of research into
Virgils use of sound effects  This anecdotal account DALY maintained
may serve to illustrate in part the sudden and radical transformation
being wrought in the ways scholars work

                                 


MICHELSON  Elements related to scholarship and technology  Electronic
texts within the context of broader trends within information technology
and scholarly communication  Evaluation of the prospects for the use of
electronic texts  Relationship of electronic texts to processes of
scholarly communication in humanities research  New exchange formats
created by scholars  Projects initiated to increase scholarly access to
converted text  Trend toward making electronic resources available
through research and education networks  Changes taking place in
scholarly communication among humanities scholars  Networkmediated
scholarship transforming traditional scholarly practices  Key
information technology trends affecting the conduct of scholarly
communication over the next decade  The trend toward enduser computing
 The trend toward greater connectivity  Effects of these trends  Key
transformations taking place  Summary of principal arguments 


Avra MICHELSON Archival Research and Evaluation Staff National Archives
and Records Administration NARA argued that establishing who will use
electronic texts and what they will use them for involves a consideration
of both information technology and scholarship trends  This
consideration includes several elements related to scholarship and
technology   the key trends in information technology that are most
relevant to scholarship  the key trends in the use of currently
available technology by scholars in the nonscientific community and 
the relationship between these two very distinct but interrelated trends
The investment in understanding this relationship being made by
information providers technologists and public policy developers as
well as by scholars themselves seems to be pervasive and growing
MICHELSON contended  She drew on collaborative work with Jeff Rothenberg
on the scholarly use of technology

MICHELSON sought to place the phenomenon of electronic texts within the
context of broader trends within information technology and scholarly
communication  She argued that electronic texts are of most use to
researchers to the extent that the researchers working context ie
their relevant bibliographic sources collegial feedback analytic tools
notes drafts etc along with their fields primary and secondary
sources also is accessible in electronic form and can be integrated in
ways that are unique to the online environment

Evaluation of the prospects for the use of electronic texts includes two
elements   an examination of the ways in which researchers currently
are using electronic texts along with other electronic resources and 
an analysis of key information technology trends that are affecting the
longterm conduct of scholarly communication  MICHELSON limited her
discussion of the use of electronic texts to the practices of humanists
and noted that the scientific community was outside the panels overview

MICHELSON examined the nature of the current relationship of electronic
texts in particular and electronic resources in general to what she
maintained were essentially five processes of scholarly communication
in humanities research  Researchers  identify sources  communicate
with their colleagues  interpret and analyze data  disseminate
their research findings and  prepare curricula to instruct the next
generation of scholars and students  This examination would produce a
clearer understanding of the synergy among these five processes that
fuels the tendency of the use of electronic resources for one process to
stimulate its use for other processes of scholarly communication

For the first process of scholarly communication the identification of
sources MICHELSON remarked the opportunity scholars now enjoy to
supplement traditional wordofmouth searches for sources among their
colleagues with new forms of electronic searching  So for example
instead of having to visit the library researchers are able to explore
descriptions of holdings in their offices  Furthermore if their own
institutions holdings prove insufficient scholars can access more than
 major American library catalogues over Internet including the
universities of California Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
Direct access to the bibliographic databases offers intellectual
empowerment to scholars by presenting a comprehensive means of browsing
through libraries from their homes and offices at their convenience

The second process of communication involves communication among
scholars  Beyond the most common methods of communication scholars are
using Email and a variety of new electronic communications formats
derived from it for further academic interchange  Email exchanges are
growing at an astonishing rate reportedly  percent a month  They
currently constitute approximately half the traffic on research and
education networks  Moreover the global spread of Email has been so
rapid that it is now possible for American scholars to use it to
communicate with colleagues in close to  other countries

Other new exchange formats created by scholars and operating on Internet
include more than  conferences with about  percent of these devoted
to topics in the social sciences and humanities  The rate of growth of
these scholarly electronic conferences also is astonishing  From l to
l  new conferences were identified on Internet  From October 
to June  an additional  conferences in the social sciences and
humanities were added to this directory of listings  Scholars have
established conferences in virtually every field within every different
discipline  For example there are currently close to  active social
science and humanities  conferences on topics such as art and
architecture ethnomusicology folklore Japanese culture medical
education and gifted and talented education  The appeal to scholars of
communicating through these conferences is that unlike any other medium
electronic conferences today provide a forum for global communication
with peers at the front end of the research process

Interpretation and analysis of sources constitutes the third process of
scholarly communication that MICHELSON discussed in terms of texts and
textual resources  The methods used to analyze sources fall somewhere on
a continuum from quantitative analysis to qualitative analysis
Typically evidence is culled and evaluated using methods drawn from both
ends of this continuum  At one end quantitative analysis involves the
use of mathematical processes such as a count of frequencies and
distributions of occurrences or on a higher level regression analysis
At the other end of the continuum qualitative analysis typically
involves nonmathematical processes oriented toward language
interpretation or the building of theory  Aspects of this work involve
the processingeither manual or computationalof large and sometimes
massive amounts of textual sources although the use of nontextual
sources as evidence such as photographs sound recordings film footage
and artifacts is significant as well

Scholars have discovered that many of the methods of interpretation and
analysis that are related to both quantitative and qualitative methods
are processes that can be performed by computers  For example computers
can count  They can count brush strokes used in a Rembrandt painting or
perform regression analysis for understanding cause and effect  By means
of advanced technologies computers can recognize patterns analyze text
and model concepts  Furthermore computers can complete these processes
faster with more sources and with greater precision than scholars who
must rely on manual interpretation of data  But if scholars are to use
computers for these processes source materials must be in a form
amenable to computerassisted analysis  For this reason many scholars
once they have identified the sources that are key to their research are
converting them to machinereadable form  Thus a representative example
of the numerous textual conversion projects organized by scholars around
the world in recent years to support computational text analysis is the
TLG the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae  This project is devoted to
converting the extant ancient texts of classical Greece  Editors note
according to the TLG Newsletter of May l TLG was in use in thirtytwo
different countries  This figure updates MICHELSONs previous count by one

The scholars performing these conversions have been asked to recognize
that the electronic sources they are converting for one use possess value
for other research purposes as well  As a result during the past few
years humanities scholars have initiated a number of projects to
increase scholarly access to converted text  So for example the Text
Encoding Initiative TEI about which more is said later in the program
was established as an effort by scholars to determine standard elements
and methods for encoding machinereadable text for electronic exchange
In a second effort to facilitate the sharing of converted text scholars
have created a new institution the Center for Electronic Texts in the
Humanities CETH  The center estimates that there are  series of
source texts in the humanities that have been converted to
machinereadable form worldwide  CETH is undertaking an international
search for converted text in the humanities compiling it into an
electronic library and preparing bibliographic descriptions of the
sources for the Research Libraries Information Networks RLIN
machinereadable data file  The library profession has begun to initiate
