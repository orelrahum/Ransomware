Morocco Economy

Overview
    The economy had recovered moderately in  because of the resolution of a
    trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales a rebound in textile
    sales to the EC lower prices for food imports a sharp increase in worker
    remittances increased Arab donor aid and generous debt rescheduling
    agreements Economic performance in  was mixed A record harvest helped
    real GDP advance by  although nonagricultural output grew by less than
     Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial policies triggered
    rapid credit and monetary growth Despite recovery of domestic demand
    import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely affected by
    phosphate marketing difficulties In January  Morocco reached a new
    month standby arrangement for  million with the IMF In February
     the Paris Club rescheduled  billion of Moroccos commercial debt
    This is thought to be Moroccos last rescheduling By  the Moroccan
    authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service obligations
    without additional rescheduling Servicing this large debt high
    unemployment and Moroccos vulnerability to external economic forces remain
    severe longterm problems

Mozambique Economy

Overview
    One of Africas poorest countries Mozambique has failed to exploit the
    economic potential of its sizable agricultural hydropower and
    transportation resources Indeed national output consumption and
    investment declined throughout the first half of the s because of
    internal disorders lack of government administrative control and a growing
    foreign debt A sharp increase in foreign aid attracted by an economic
    reform policy has resulted in successive years of economic growth since
     Agricultural output nevertheless is at about only  of its 
    level and grain has to be imported Industry operates at only  of
    capacity The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat
    The continuation of civil strife through  has dimmed chances of foreign

Nauru Economy

Overview
    Revenues come from the export of phosphates the reserves of which are
    expected to be exhausted by the year  Phosphates have given Nauruans
    one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World   annually
    Few other resources exist so most necessities must be imported including
    fresh water from Australia The rehabilitation of mined land and the
    replacement of income from phosphates are serious longterm problems
    Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
    cushion the transition
