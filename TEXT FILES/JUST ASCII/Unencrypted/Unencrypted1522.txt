To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife
The former vain to hope argues as vain
The latter for what place can be for us
Within Heavens bound unless Heavens Lord supreme
We overpower? Suppose he should relent
And publish grace to all on promise made
Of new subjection with what eyes could we
Stand in his presence humble and receive
Strict laws imposed to celebrate his throne
With warbled hyms and to his Godhead sing
Forced hallelujahs while he lordly sits
Our envied sovereign and his altar breathes
Ambrosial odours and ambrosial flowers
Our servile offerings? This must be our task
In Heaven this our delight How wearisome
Eternity so spent in worship paid
To whom we hate Let us not then pursue
By force impossible by leave obtained
Unacceptable though in Heaven our state
Of splendid vassalage but rather seek
Our own good from ourselves and from our own
Live to ourselves though in this vast recess
Free and to none accountable preferring
Hard liberty before the easy yoke
Of servile pomp Our greatness will appear
Then most conspicuous when great things of small
Useful of hurtful prosperous of adverse
We can create and in what place soeer
Thrive under evil and work ease out of pain
Through labour and endurance This deep world
Of darkness do we dread? How oft amidst
Thick clouds and dark doth Heavens allruling Sire
Choose to reside his glory unobscured
And with the majesty of darkness round
Covers his throne from whence deep thunders roar
Mustering their rage and Heaven resembles Hell
As he our darkness cannot we his light
Imitate when we please? This desert soil
Wants not her hidden lustre gems and gold
Nor want we skill or art from whence to raise
Magnificence and what can Heaven show more?
Our torments also may in length of time
Become our elements these piercing fires
As soft as now severe our temper changed
Into their temper which must needs remove
The sensible of pain All things invite
To peaceful counsels and the settled state
Of order how in safety best we may
Compose our present evils with regard
Of what we are and where dismissing quite
All thoughts of war Ye have what I advise"
  He scarce had finished when such murmur filled
Th assembly as when hollow rocks retain
The sound of blustering winds which all night long
Had roused the sea now with hoarse cadence lull
Seafaring men oerwatched whose bark by chance
Or pinnace anchors in a craggy bay
After the tempest Such applause was heard
As Mammon ended and his sentence pleased
Advising peace for such another field
They dreaded worse than Hell so much the fear
Of thunder and the sword of Michael
Wrought still within them and no less desire
To found this nether empire which might rise
By policy and long process of time
In emulation opposite to Heaven
Which when Beelzebub perceivedthan whom
Satan except none higher satwith grave
Aspect he rose and in his rising seemed
A pillar of state Deep on his front engraven
Deliberation sat and public care
And princely counsel in his face yet shone
Majestic though in ruin Sage he stood
With Atlantean shoulders fit to bear
The weight of mightiest monarchies his look
Drew audience and attention still as night
Or summers noontide air while thus he spake
  "Thrones and Imperial Powers Offspring of Heaven
Ethereal Virtues or these titles now
Must we renounce and changing style be called
Princes of Hell? for so the popular vote
