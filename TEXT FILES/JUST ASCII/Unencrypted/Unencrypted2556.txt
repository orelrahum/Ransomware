    grew roughly  in FY and  in FY An oil windfall in  combined
    with a substantial increase in imports contributed to Irans recent economic
    growth Iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to
    reduce government intervention including subsidies and has allocated
    substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the
    economy Nevertheless lower oil revenues in   oil accounts for more
    than  of export revenues and provides roughly  of the financing for
    the fiveyear economic development plan  and dramatic increases in external
    debt are threatening development plans and could prompt Iran to cut imports
