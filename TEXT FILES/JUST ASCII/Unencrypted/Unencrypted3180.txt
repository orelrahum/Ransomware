dears  Its high time you were all in bed  On various pretexts
they all moved off and Alice was soon left alone

  I wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah she said to herself in a
melancholy tone  Nobody seems to like her down here and Im

In a little while however she again heard a little pattering of
footsteps in the distance and she looked up eagerly half hoping
that the Mouse had changed his mind and was coming back to
finish his story

that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to without
trying to explain the mistake it had made
