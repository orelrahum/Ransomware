Italy Economy

Overview
    Since World War II the economy has changed from one based on agriculture
    into a ranking industrial economy with approximately the same total and per
    capita output as France and the UK The country is still divided into a
    developed industrial north dominated by small private companies and an
    undeveloped agricultural south dominated by large public enterprises
    Services account for  of GDP industry about  agriculture  and
    public administration  Most raw materials needed by industry and over
     of energy requirements must be imported After growing at an annual
    average rate of  during the period  growth slowed to about  in
     For the s Italy faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering
    communications system curbing pollution in major industrial centers and
    adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic
    integration of the European Community

Ivory Coast Economy

Overview
    Ivory Coast is among the worlds largest producers and exporters of coffee
    cocoa beans and palmkernel oil Consequently the economy is highly
    sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and cocoa and
    to weather conditions Despite attempts by the government to diversify the
    economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related industries
    The agricultural sector accounts for over onethird of GDP and about  of
    export earnings and employs about  of the labor force A collapse of
    world cocoa and coffee prices in  threw the economy into a recession
    from which the country had not recovered by  Continuing poor prices for
    commodity exports an overvalued exchange rate a bloated publicsector wage

Jamaica Economy

Overview
    The economy is based on sugar bauxite and tourism In  it suffered a
    setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina
    industry a major source of hard currency earnings Since  an economic
    recovery has been under way In  conditions began to improve for the
    bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices The
    recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and tourism
    sectors In September  Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on
    crops and the electric power system a sharp but temporary setback to the
    economy By October  the economic recovery from the hurricane was
    largely complete and real growth was up about  for  In
