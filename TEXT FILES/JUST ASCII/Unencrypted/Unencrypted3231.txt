    about  meters in thickness although pressure ridges may be three times
    that size clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral Stream but nearly
    straight line movement from the New Siberian Islands Russia to Denmark
    Strait between Greenland and Iceland the ice pack is surrounded by open
    seas during the summer but more than doubles in size during the winter and
    extends to the encircling land masses the ocean floor is about
