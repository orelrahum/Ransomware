Jordan Economy

Overview
    Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the late
    s and early s when its annual GNP growth averaged more than  In
    the remainder of the s however reductions in both Arab aid and worker
    remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly  per year
    Imports  mainly oil capital goods consumer durables and food  have been
    outstripping exports with the difference covered by aid remittances and
    borrowing In mid the Jordanian Government began debtrescheduling
    negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually
    reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms The
    Persian Gulf crisis that began in August  however aggravated Jordans
    already serious economic problems forcing the government to shelve the IMF
    program stop most debt payments and suspend rescheduling negotiations Aid
    from Gulf Arab states and worker remittances have plunged and refugees have
    flooded the country straining government resources Economic recovery is
    unlikely without substantial foreign aid debt relief and economic reform
