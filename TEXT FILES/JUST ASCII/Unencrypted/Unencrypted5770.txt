Sudan Economy

Overview
    Sudan is buffeted by civil war chronic political instability adverse
    weather high inflation and counterproductive economic policies The
    economy is dominated by governmental entities that account for more than 
    of new investment The private sectors main areas of activity are
    agriculture and trading with most private industrial investment predating
     The economys base is agriculture which employs  of the work
    force Industry mainly processes agricultural items Sluggish economic
    performance over the past decade attributable largely to declining annual
    rainfall has reduced levels of per capita income and consumption A high
    foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause difficulties In  the
    International Monetary Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan
    noncooperative because of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund Despite
    subsequent government efforts to implement reforms urged by the IMF and the
    World Bank the economy remained stagnant in FY as entrepreneurs lack the
    incentive to take economic risks
