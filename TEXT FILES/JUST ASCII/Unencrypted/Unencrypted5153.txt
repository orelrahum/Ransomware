Not unperceived of Adam who to Eve
While the great visitant approached thus spake
Eve now expect great tidings which perhaps
Of us will soon determine or impose
New laws to be observed for I descry
From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill
One of the heavenly host and by his gait
None of the meanest some great Potentate
Or of the Thrones above such majesty
Invests him coming yet not terrible
That I should fear nor sociably mild
As Raphael that I should much confide
But solemn and sublime whom not to offend
With reverence I must meet and thou retire
He ended and the ArchAngel soon drew nigh
Not in his shape celestial but as man
Clad to meet man over his lucid arms
A military vest of purple flowed
Livelier than Meliboean or the grain
Of Sarra worn by kings and heroes old
In time of truce Iris had dipt the woof
His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime
In manhood where youth ended by his side
As in a glistering zodiack hung the sword
Satans dire dread and in his hand the spear
Adam bowed low he kingly from his state
Inclined not but his coming thus declared
Adam Heavens high behest no preface needs
Sufficient that thy prayers are heard and Death
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress
Defeated of his seisure many days
Given thee of grace wherein thou mayest repent
And one bad act with many deeds well done
Mayest cover  Well may then thy Lord appeased
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claim
But longer in this Paradise to dwell
Permits not to remove thee I am come
And send thee from the garden forth to till
The ground whence thou wast taken fitter soil
He added not for Adam at the news
Heartstruck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood
That all his senses bound Eve who unseen
Yet all had heard with audible lament
Discovered soon the place of her retire
O unexpected stroke worse than of Death
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
Thee native soil these happy walks and shades
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend
Quiet though sad the respite of that day
That must be mortal to us both  O flowers
That never will in other climate grow
My early visitation and my last
 t even which I bred up with tender hand
From the first opening bud and gave ye names
Who now shall rear ye to the sun or rank
Your tribes and water from the ambrosial fount?
Thee lastly nuptial bower by me adorned
With what to sight or smell was sweet from thee
How shall I part and whither wander down
Into a lower world to this obscure
And wild? how shall we breathe in other air
Less pure accustomed to immortal fruits?
Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild
Lament not Eve but patiently resign
What justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart
Thus overfond on that which is not thine
Thy going is not lonely with thee goes
Thy husband whom to follow thou art bound
Where he abides think there thy native soil
Adam by this from the cold sudden damp
Recovering and his scattered spirits returned
To Michael thus his humble words addressed
Celestial whether among the Thrones or named
Of them the highest for such of shape may seem
Prince above princes gently hast thou told
Thy message which might else in telling wound
And in performing end us what besides
Of sorrow and dejection and despair
Our frailty can sustain thy tidings bring
Departure from this happy place our sweet
Recess and only consolation left
Familiar to our eyes all places else
Inhospitable appear and desolate
Nor knowing us nor known  And if by prayer
Incessant I could hope to change the will
Of Him who all things can I would not cease
To weary him with my assiduous cries
But prayer against his absolute decree
No more avails than breath against the wind
Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth
Therefore to his great bidding I submit
This most afflicts me that departing hence
As from his face I shall be hid deprived
His blessed countenance  Here I could frequent
With worship place by place where he vouchsafed
Presence Divine and to my sons relate
On this mount he appeared under this tree
Stood visible among these pines his voice
I heard here with him at this fountain talked
So many grateful altars I would rear
Of grassy turf and pile up every stone
Of lustre from the brook in memory
Or monument to ages and theron
Offer sweetsmelling gums and fruits and flowers
In yonder nether world where shall I seek
His bright appearances or footstep trace?
For though I fled him angry yet recalled
To life prolonged and promised race I now
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
Of glory and far off his steps adore
To whom thus Michael with regard benign
Adam thou knowest Heaven his and all the Earth
Not this rock only his Omnipresence fills
Land sea and air and every kind that lives
Fomented by his virtual power and warmed
All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule
No despicable gift surmise not then
His presence to these narrow bounds confined
Of Paradise or Eden this had been
Perhaps thy capital seat from whence had spread
All generations and had hither come
From all the ends of the earth to celebrate
And reverence thee their great progenitor
But this preeminence thou hast lost brought down
To dwell on even ground now with thy sons
Yet doubt not but in valley and in plain
God is as here and will be found alike
Present and of his presence many a sign
Still following thee still compassing thee round
With goodness and paternal love his face
Express and of his steps the track divine
Which that thou mayest believe and be confirmed
Ere thou from hence depart know I am sent
To show thee what shall come in future days
To thee and to thy offspring good with bad
Expect to hear supernal grace contending
With sinfulness of men thereby to learn
True patience and to temper joy with fear
And pious sorrow equally inured
By moderation either state to bear
Prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead
Safest thy life and best prepared endure
Thy mortal passage when it comesAscend
This hill let Eve for I have drenched her eyes
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wakest
As once thou sleptst while she to life was formed
To whom thus Adam gratefully replied
Ascend I follow thee safe Guide the path
Thou leadest me and to the hand of Heaven submit
However chastening to the evil turn
My obvious breast arming to overcome
By suffering and earn rest from labour won
If so I may attain  So both ascend
In the visions of God  It was a hill
Of Paradise the highest from whose top
The hemisphere of earth in clearest ken
Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay
Not higher that hill nor wider looking round
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
Our second Adam in the wilderness
To show him all Earths kingdoms and their glory
His eye might there command wherever stood
City of old or modern fame the seat
Of mightiest empire from the destined walls
Of Cambalu seat of Cathaian Can
And Samarchand by Oxus Temirs throne
To Paquin of Sinaean kings and thence
To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul
Down to the golden Chersonese or where
The Persian in Ecbatan sat or since
In Hispahan or where the Russian Ksar
In Mosco or the Sultan in Bizance
Turchestanborn nor could his eye not ken
The empire of Negus to his utmost port
Ercoco and the less maritim kings
Mombaza and Quiloa and Melind
And Sofala thought Ophir to the realm
Of Congo and Angola farthest south
Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount
The kingdoms of Almansor Fez and Sus
Morocco and Algiers and Tremisen
On Europe thence and where Rome was to sway
The world in spirit perhaps he also saw
Rich Mexico the seat of Montezume
And Cusco in Peru the richer seat
Of Atabalipa and yet unspoiled
Guiana whose great city Geryons sons
Call El Dorado  But to nobler sights
Michael from Adams eyes the film removed
Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight
Had bred then purged with euphrasy and rue
The visual nerve for he had much to see
And from the well of life three drops instilled
So deep the power of these ingredients pierced
Even to the inmost seat of mental sight
That Adam now enforced to close his eyes
Sunk down and all his spirits became entranced
But him the gentle Angel by the hand
Soon raised and his attention thus recalled
Adam now ope thine eyes and first behold
The effects which thy original crime hath wrought
In some to spring from thee who never touched
The excepted tree nor with the snake conspired
Nor sinned thy sin yet from that sin derive
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds
His eyes he opened and beheld a field
Part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves
New reaped the other part sheepwalks and folds
I the midst an altar as the landmark stood
Rustick of grassy sord thither anon
A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought
First fruits the green ear and the yellow sheaf
Unculled as came to hand a shepherd next
More meek came with the firstlings of his flock
Choicest and best then sacrificing laid
The inwards and their fat with incense strowed
On the cleft wood and all due rights performed
His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven
Consumed with nimble glance and grateful steam
The others not for his was not sincere
Whereat he inly raged and as they talked
Smote him into the midriff with a stone
That beat out life he felland deadly pale
Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused
Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
Dismayed and thus in haste to the Angel cried
O Teacher some great mischief hath befallen
To that meek man who well had sacrificed
Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?
To whom Michael thus he also moved replied
These two are brethren Adam and to come
Out of thy loins the unjust the just hath slain
For envy that his brothers offering found
From Heaven acceptance but the bloody fact
Will be avenged and the others faith approved
Lose no reward though here thou see him die
Rolling in dust and gore  To which our sire
Alas both for the deed and for the cause
But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way
I must return to native dust?  O sight
Of terrour foul and ugly to behold
Horrid to think how horrible to feel
To whom thus Michael  Death thou hast seen
In his first shape on Man but many shapes
Of Death and many are the ways that lead
To his grim cave all dismal yet to sense
More terrible at the entrance than within
Some as thou sawest by violent stroke shall die
By fire flood famine by intemperance more
In meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring
Diseases dire of which a monstrous crew
Before thee shall appear that thou mayest know
What misery the inabstinence of Eve
Shall bring on Men  Immediately a place
Before his eyes appeared sad noisome dark
A lazarhouse it seemed wherein were laid
Numbers of all diseased all maladies
Of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms
Of heartsick agony all feverous kinds
Convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs
Intestine stone and ulcer colickpangs
Demoniack phrenzy moaping melancholy
And moonstruck madness pining atrophy
Marasmus and widewasting pestilence
Dropsies and asthmas and jointracking rheums
Dire was the tossing deep the groans Despair
Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch
And over them triumphant Death his dart
Shook but delayed to strike though oft invoked
With vows as their chief good and final hope
Sight so deform what heart of rock could long
Dryeyed behold?  Adam could not but wept
Though not of woman born compassion quelled
His best of man and gave him up to tears
A space till firmer thoughts restrained excess
And scarce recovering words his plaint renewed
O miserable mankind to what fall
Degraded to what wretched state reserved
Better end here unborn  Why is life given
To be thus wrested from us? rather why
Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew
What we receive would either no accept
Life offered or soon beg to lay it down
Glad to be so dismissed in peace  Can thus
The image of God in Man created once
So goodly and erect though faulty since
To such unsightly sufferings be debased
Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man
Retaining still divine similitude
In part from such deformities be free
And for his Makers image sake exempt?
Their Makers image answered Michael then
Forsook them when themselves they vilified
To serve ungoverned Appetite and took
His image whom they served a brutish vice
Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve
Therefore so abject is their punishment
Disfiguring not Gods likeness but their own
Or if his likeness by themselves defaced
While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules
To loathsome sickness worthily since they
Gods image did not reverence in themselves
I yield it just said Adam and submit
But is there yet no other way besides
These painful passages how we may come
To death and mix with our connatural dust?
There is said Michael if thou well observe
The rule of Not too much by temperance taught
In what thou eatest and drinkest seeking from thence
Due nourishment not gluttonous delight
Till many years over thy head return
So mayest thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop
Into thy mothers lap or be with ease
Gathered nor harshly plucked for death mature
This is Old Age but then thou must outlive
Thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change
To withered weak and gray thy senses then
Obtuse all taste of pleasure must forego
To what thou hast and for the air of youth
Hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reign
A melancholy damp of cold and dry
To weigh thy spirits down and last consume
The balm of life  To whom our ancestor
Henceforth I fly not death nor would prolong
Life much bent rather how I may be quit
Fairest and easiest of this cumbrous charge
Which I must keep till my appointed day
Of rendering up and patiently attend
My dissolution  Michael replied
Nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livest
Live well how long or short permit to Heaven
And now prepare thee for another sight
He looked and saw a spacious plain whereon
Were tents of various hue by some were herds
Of cattle grazing others whence the sound
Of instruments that made melodious chime
Was heard of harp and organ and who moved
Their stops and chords was seen his volant touch
Instinct through all proportions low and high
Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue
In other part stood one who at the forge
Labouring two massy clods of iron and brass
Had melted whether found where casual fire
Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale
Down to the veins of earth thence gliding hot
To some caves mouth or whether washed by stream
From underground the liquid ore he drained
Into fit moulds prepared from which he formed
First his own tools then what might else be wrought
Fusil or graven in metal  After these
But on the hither side a different sort
From the high neighbouring hills which was their seat
Down to the plain descended by their guise
Just men they seemed and all their study bent
To worship God aright and know his works
Not hid nor those things last which might preserve
Freedom and peace to Men they on the plain
Long had not walked when from the tents behold
A bevy of fair women richly gay
In gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung
Soft amorous ditties and in dance came on
The men though grave eyed them and let their eyes
Rove without rein till in the amorous net
Fast caught they liked and each his liking chose
And now of love they treat till the eveningstar
Loves harbinger appeared then all in heat
They light the nuptial torch and bid invoke
Hymen then first to marriage rites invoked
With feast and musick all the tents resound
Such happy interview and fair event
Of love and youth not lost songs garlands flowers
And charming symphonies attached the heart
Of Adam soon inclined to admit delight
The bent of nature which he thus expressed
True opener of mine eyes prime Angel blest
Much better seems this vision and more hope
Of peaceful days portends than those two past
Those were of hate and death or pain much worse
Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends
To whom thus Michael  Judge not what is best
By pleasure though to nature seeming meet
Created as thou art to nobler end
Holy and pure conformity divine
Those tents thou sawest so pleasant were the tents
Of wickedness wherein shall dwell his race
Who slew his brother studious they appear
Of arts that polish life inventers rare
Unmindful of their Maker though his Spirit
Taught them but they his gifts acknowledged none
Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget
For that fair female troop thou sawest that seemed
Of Goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay
Yet empty of all good wherein consists
Womans domestick honour and chief praise
Bred only and completed to the taste
Of lustful appetence to sing to dance
To dress and troll the tongue and roll the eye
To these that sober race of men whose lives
Religious titled them the sons of God
Shall yield up all their virtue all their fame
Ignobly to the trains and to the smiles
Of these fair atheists and now swim in joy
Erelong to swim at large and laugh for which
The world erelong a world of tears must weep
To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft
O pity and shame that they who to live well
Entered so fair should turn aside to tread
Paths indirect or in the mid way faint
But still I see the tenour of Mans woe
Holds on the same from Woman to begin
From Mans effeminate slackness it begins
Said the Angel who should better hold his place
By wisdom and superiour gifts received
But now prepare thee for another scene
He looked and saw wide territory spread
Before him towns and rural works between
Cities of men with lofty gates and towers
Concourse in arms fierce faces threatening war
Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise
Part wield their arms part curb the foaming steed
Single or in array of battle ranged
Both horse and foot nor idly mustering stood
One way a band select from forage drives
A herd of beeves fair oxen and fair kine
From a fat meadow ground or fleecy flock
Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain
Their booty scarce with life the shepherds fly
But call in aid which makes a bloody fray
With cruel tournament the squadrons join
Where cattle pastured late now scattered lies
With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field
Deserted  Others to a city strong
Lay siege encamped by battery scale and mine
Assaulting others from the wall defend
With dart and javelin stones and sulphurous fire
On each hand slaughter and gigantick deeds
In other part the sceptered heralds call
To council in the citygates anon
Grayheaded men and grave with warriours mixed
Assemble and harangues are heard but soon
In factious opposition till at last
Of middle age one rising eminent
In wise deport spake much of right and wrong
Of justice or religion truth and peace
And judgement from above him old and young
Exploded and had seized with violent hands
Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
Unseen amid the throng so violence
Proceeded and oppression and swordlaw
Through all the plain and refuge none was found
Adam was all in tears and to his guide
Lamenting turned full sad Owhat are these
Deaths ministers not men? who thus deal death
Inhumanly to men and multiply
Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
His brother for of whom such massacre
Make they but of their brethren men of men
But who was that just man whom had not Heaven
Rescued had in his righteousness been lost?
To whom thus Michael  These are the product
Of those illmated marriages thou sawest
Where good with bad were matched who of themselves
Abhor to join and by imprudence mixed
Produce prodigious births of body or mind
Such were these giants men of high renown
For in those days might only shall be admired
And valour and heroick virtue called
To overcome in battle and subdue
Nations and bring home spoils with infinite
Manslaughter shall be held the highest pitch
Of human glory and for glory done
Of triumph to be styled great conquerours
Patrons of mankind Gods and sons of Gods
Destroyers rightlier called and plagues of men
Thus fame shall be achieved renown on earth
And what most merits fame in silence hid
But he the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst
The only righteous in a world preverse
And therefore hated therefore so beset
With foes for daring single to be just
And utter odious truth that God would come
To judge them with his Saints him the Most High
Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds
Did as thou sawest receive to walk with God
High in salvation and the climes of bliss
Exempt from death to show thee what reward
Awaits the good the rest what punishment
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold
He looked and saw the face of things quite changed
The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar
All now was turned to jollity and game
To luxury and riot feast and dance
Marrying or prostituting as befel
Rape or adultery where passing fair
Allured them thence from cups to civil broils
At length a reverend sire among them came
And of their doings great dislike declared
And testified against their ways he oft
Frequented their assemblies whereso met
Triumphs or festivals and to them preached
Conversion and repentance as to souls
In prison under judgements imminent
But all in vain which when he saw he ceased
Contending and removed his tents far off
Then from the mountain hewing timber tall
Began to build a vessel of huge bulk
Measured by cubit length and breadth and highth
Smeared round with pitch and in the side a door
Contrived and of provisions laid in large
For man and beast when lo a wonder strange
Of every beast and bird and insect small
Came sevens and pairs and entered in as taught
Their order last the sire and his three sons
With their four wives and God made fast the door
Mean while the southwind rose and with black wings
Widehovering all the clouds together drove
From under Heaven the hills to their supply
Vapour and exhalation dusk and moist
Sent up amain and now the thickened sky
Like a dark cieling stood down rushed the rain
Impetuous and continued till the earth
No more was seen the floating vessel swum
Uplifted and secure with beaked prow
Rode tilting oer the waves all dwellings else
Flood overwhelmed and them with all their pomp
Deep under water rolled sea covered sea
Sea without shore and in their palaces
Where luxury late reigned seamonsters whelped
And stabled of mankind so numerous late
All left in one small bottom swum imbarked
How didst thou grieve then Adam to behold
The end of all thy offspring end so sad
Depopulation  Thee another flood
Of tears and sorrow a flood thee also drowned
And sunk thee as thy sons till gently reared
By the Angel on thy feet thou stoodest at last
