To recompense his distance in their sight
Had rounded still the horizon and not known
Or east or west which had forbid the snow
From cold Estotiland and south as far
Beneath Magellan  At that tasted fruit
The sun as from Thyestean banquet turned
His course intended else how had the world
Inhabited though sinless more than now
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?
These changes in the Heavens though slow produced
Like change on sea and land sideral blast
Vapour and mist and exhalation hot
Corrupt and pestilent  Now from the north
Of Norumbega and the Samoed shore
Bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice
And snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw
Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud
And Thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn
With adverse blast upturns them from the south
Notus and Afer black with thunderous clouds
From Serraliona thwart of these as fierce
Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds
Eurus and Zephyr with their lateral noise
Sirocco and Libecchio  Thus began
Outrage from lifeless things but Discord first
Daughter of Sin among the irrational
Death introduced through fierce antipathy
Beast now with beast gan war and fowl with fowl
And fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving
Devoured each other nor stood much in awe
Of Man but fled him or with countenance grim
Glared on him passing  These were from without
The growing miseries which Adam saw
Already in part though hid in gloomiest shade
To sorrow abandoned but worse felt within
And in a troubled sea of passion tost
Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint
O miserable of happy  Is this the end
Of this new glorious world and me so late
The glory of that glory who now become
Accursed of blessed? hide me from the face
Of God whom to behold was then my highth
Of happinessYet well if here would end
The misery I deserved it and would bear
My own deservings but this will not serve
All that I eat or drink or shall beget
Is propagated curse  O voice once heard
Delightfully Encrease and multiply
Now death to hear for what can I encrease
Or multiply but curses on my head?
Who of all ages to succeed but feeling
The evil on him brought by me will curse
My head?  Ill fare our ancestor impure
For this we may thank Adam but his thanks
Shall be the execration so besides
Mine own that bide upon me all from me
Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound
On me as on their natural center light
Heavy though in their place  O fleeting joys
Of Paradise dear bought with lasting woes
Did I request thee Maker from my clay
To mould me Man? did I solicit thee
From darkness to promote me or here place
In this delicious garden?  As my will
Concurred not to my being it were but right
And equal to reduce me to my dust
Desirous to resign and render back
All I received unable to perform
Thy terms too hard by which I was to hold
The good I sought not  To the loss of that
Sufficient penalty why hast thou added
The sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable
Why am I mocked with death and lengthened out
To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet
Mortality my sentence and be earth
Insensible  How glad would lay me down
As in my mothers lap  There I should rest
And sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
Would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
To me and to my offspring would torment me
With cruel expectation  Yet one doubt
Pursues me still lest all I cannot die
Lest that pure breath of life the spirit of Man
Which God inspired cannot together perish
With this corporeal clod then in the grave
Or in some other dismal place who knows
But I shall die a living death?  O thought
Horrid if true  Yet why? It was but breath
Of life that sinned what dies but what had life
And sin?  The body properly had neither
All of me then shall die let this appease
The doubt since human reach no further knows
For though the Lord of all be infinite
Is his wrath also?  Be it Man is not so
But mortal doomed  How can he exercise
Wrath without end on Man whom death must end?
Can he make deathless death?  That were to make
Strange contradiction which to God himself
Impossible is held as argument
Of weakness not of power  Will he draw out
For angers sake finite to infinite
In punished Man to satisfy his rigour
Satisfied never?  That were to extend
His sentence beyond dust and Natures law
By which all causes else according still
To the reception of their matter act
Not to the extent of their own sphere  But say
That death be not one stroke as I supposed
Bereaving sense but endless misery
From this day onward which I feel begun
Both in me and without me and so last
To perpetuityAy methat fear
Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution
On my defenceless head both Death and I
Am found eternal and incorporate both
Nor I on my part single in me all
Posterity stands cursed  Fair patrimony
That I must leave ye Sons  O were I able
To waste it all myself and leave ye none
So disinherited how would you bless
Me now your curse  Ah why should all mankind
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemned
It guiltless?  But from me what can proceed
But all corrupt both mind and will depraved
Not to do only but to will the same
With me?  How can they then acquitted stand
In sight of God?  Him after all disputes
Forced I absolve all my evasions vain
And reasonings though through mazes lead me still
But to my own conviction first and last
On me me only as the source and spring
Of all corruption all the blame lights due
So might the wrath  Fond wishcouldst thou support
That burden heavier than the earth to bear
Than all the world much heavier though divided
With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desirest
And what thou fearest alike destroys all hope
Of refuge and concludes thee miserable
Beyond all past example and future
To Satan only like both crime and doom
O Conscience into what abyss of fears
And horrours hast thou driven me out of which
I find no way from deep to deeper plunged
Thus Adam to himself lamented loud
Through the still night not now as ere Man fell
Wholesome and cool and mild but with black air
Accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom
Which to his evil conscience represented
All things with double terrour  On the ground
Outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft
Cursed his creation  Death as oft accused
Of tardy execution since denounced
The day of his offence  Why comes not Death
Said he with one thriceacceptable stroke
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word
Justice Divine not hasten to be just?
But Death comes not at call Justice Divine
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries
O woods O fountains hillocks dales and bowers
With other echo late I taught your shades
To answer and resound far other song
Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld
Desolate where she sat approaching nigh
Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed
But her with stern regard he thus repelled
Out of my sight thou Serpent  That name best
Befits thee with him leagued thyself as false
And hateful nothing wants but that thy shape
Like his and colour serpentine may show
Thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
Henceforth lest that too heavenly form pretended
To hellish falshood snare them  But for thee
I had persisted happy had not thy pride
And wandering vanity when least was safe
Rejected my forewarning and disdained
Not to be trusted longing to be seen
Though by the Devil himself him overweening
To overreach but with the serpent meeting
Fooled and beguiled by him thou I by thee
To trust thee from my side imagined wise
Constant mature proof against all assaults
And understood not all was but a show
Rather than solid virtue all but a rib
Crooked by nature bent as now appears
More to the part sinister from me drawn
Well if thrown out as supernumerary
To my just number found  O why did God
Creator wise that peopled highest Heaven
With Spirits masculine create at last
This novelty on earth this fair defect
Of nature and not fill the world at once
With Men as Angels without feminine
Or find some other way to generate
Mankind?  This mischief had not been befallen
And more that shall befall innumerable
Disturbances on earth through female snares
And strait conjunction with this sex for either
He never shall find out fit mate but such
As some misfortune brings him or mistake
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
Through her perverseness but shall see her gained
By a far worse or if she love withheld
By parents or his happiest choice too late
Shall meet already linked and wedlockbound
To a fell adversary his hate or shame
Which infinite calamity shall cause
To human life and houshold peace confound
He added not and from her turned but Eve
Not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing
And tresses all disordered at his feet
Fell humble and embracing them besought
His peace and thus proceeded in her plaint
Forsake me not thus Adam witness Heaven
What love sincere and reverence in my heart
I bear thee and unweeting have offended
Unhappily deceived  Thy suppliant
I beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not
Whereon I live thy gentle looks thy aid
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress
My only strength and stay  Forlorn of thee
Whither shall I betake me where subsist?
While yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps
Between us two let there be peace both joining
As joined in injuries one enmity
Against a foe by doom express assigned us
That cruel Serpent  On me exercise not
Thy hatred for this misery befallen
On me already lost me than thyself
More miserable  Both have sinnedbut thou
Against God only I against God and thee
And to the place of judgement will return
There with my cries importune Heaven that all
The sentence from thy head removed may light
On me sole cause to thee of all this woe
Me me only just object of his ire
She ended weeping and her lowly plight
Immoveable till peace obtained from fault
Acknowledged and deplored in Adam wrought
Commiseration  Soon his heart relented
Towards her his life so late and sole delight
Now at his feet submissive in distress
Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking
His counsel whom she had displeased his aid
As one disarmed his anger all he lost
And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon
Unwary and too desirous as before
So now of what thou knowest not who desirest
The punishment all on thyself alas
Bear thine own first ill able to sustain
His full wrath whose thou feelest as yet least part
And my displeasure bearest so ill  If prayers
Could alter high decrees I to that place
Would speed before thee and be louder heard
That on my head all might be visited
Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven
To me committed and by me exposed
But riselet us no more contend nor blame
Each other blamed enough elsewhere but strive
In offices of love how we may lighten
Each others burden in our share of woe
Since this days death denounced if aught I see
Will prove no sudden but a slowpaced evil
A long days dying to augment our pain
And to our seed O hapless seed derived
To whom thus Eve recovering heart replied
Adam by sad experiment I know
How little weight my words with thee can find
Found so erroneous thence by just event
Found so unfortunate  Nevertheless
Restored by thee vile as I am to place
Of new acceptance hopeful to regain
Thy love the sole contentment of my heart
Living or dying from thee I will not hide
What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen
Tending to some relief of our extremes
Or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable
As in our evils and of easier choice
If care of our descent perplex us most
Which must be born to certain woe devoured
By Death at last and miserable it is
To be to others cause of misery
Our own begotten and of our loins to bring
Into this cursed world a woeful race
That after wretched life must be at last
Food for so foul a monster in thy power
It lies yet ere conception to prevent
The race unblest to being yet unbegot
Childless thou art childless remain so Death
Shall be deceived his glut and with us two
Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw
But if thou judge it hard and difficult
Conversing looking loving to abstain
From loves due rights nuptial embraces sweet
And with desire to languish without hope
Before the present object languishing
With like desire which would be misery
And torment less than none of what we dread
Then both ourselves and seed at once to free
From what we fear for both let us make short 
Let us seek Death  or he not found supply
With our own hands his office on ourselves
Why stand we longer shivering under fears
That show no end but death and have the power
Of many ways to die the shortest choosing
Destruction with destruction to destroy? 
She ended here or vehement despair
Broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts
Had entertained as dyed her cheeks with pale
But Adam with such counsel nothing swayed
To better hopes his more attentive mind
Labouring had raised and thus to Eve replied
Eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
To argue in thee something more sublime
And excellent than what thy mind contemns
But selfdestruction therefore sought refutes
That excellence thought in thee and implies
Not thy contempt but anguish and regret
For loss of life and pleasure overloved
Or if thou covet death as utmost end
Of misery so thinking to evade
The penalty pronounced doubt not but God
Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire than so
To be forestalled much more I fear lest death
So snatched will not exempt us from the pain
We are by doom to pay rather such acts
Of contumacy will provoke the Highest
To make death in us live  Then let us seek
Some safer resolution which methinks
I have in view calling to mind with heed
Part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise
The Serpents head piteous amends unless
Be meant whom I conjecture our grand foe
Satan who in the serpent hath contrived
Against us this deceit  To crush his head
Would be revenge indeed which will be lost
By death brought on ourselves or childless days
Resolved as thou proposest so our foe
Shal scape his punishment ordained and we
Instead shall double ours upon our heads
No more be mentioned then of violence
Against ourselves and wilful barrenness
That cuts us off from hope and savours only
Rancour and pride impatience and despite
Reluctance against God and his just yoke
Laid on our necks  Remember with what mild
And gracious temper he both heard and judged
Without wrath or reviling we expected
Immediate dissolution which we thought
Was meant by death that day when loto thee
Pains only in childbearing were foretold
And bringing forth soon recompensed with joy
Fruit of thy womb  On me the curse aslope
Glanced on the ground with labour I must earn
My bread what harm? Idleness had been worse
My labour will sustain me and lest cold
Or heat should injure us his timely care
Hath unbesought provided and his hands
Clothed us unworthy pitying while he judged
How much more if we pray him will his ear
Be open and his heart to pity incline
And teach us further by what means to shun
The inclement seasons rain ice hail and snow
Which now the sky with various face begins
To show us in this mountain while the winds
Blow moist and keen shattering the graceful locks
Of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek
Some better shroud some better warmth to cherish
Our limbs benummed ere this diurnal star
Leave cold the night how we his gathered beams
Reflected may with matter sere foment
Or by collision of two bodies grind
The air attrite to fire as late the clouds
Justling or pushed with winds rude in their shock
Tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame driven down
Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine
And sends a comfortable heat from far
Which might supply the sun  Such fire to use
And what may else be remedy or cure
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought
He will instruct us praying and of grace
Beseeching him so as we need not fear
To pass commodiously this life sustained
By him with many comforts till we end
In dust our final rest and native home
What better can we do than to the place
Repairing where he judged us prostrate fall
Before him reverent and there confess
Humbly our faults and pardon beg with tears
Watering the ground and with our sighs the air
Frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign
Of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek



Book XI


Undoubtedly he will relent and turn
From his displeasure in whose look serene
When angry most he seemed and most severe
What else but favour grace and mercy shone?
So spake our father penitent nor Eve
Felt less remorse they forthwith to the place
Repairing where he judged them prostrate fell
Before him reverent and both confessed
Humbly their faults and pardon begged with tears
Watering the ground and with their sighs the air
Frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign
Of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek
Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
Praying for from the mercyseat above
Prevenient grace descending had removed
The stony from their hearts and made new flesh
Regenerate grow instead that sighs now breathed
Unutterable which the Spirit of prayer
Inspired and winged for Heaven with speedier flight
Than loudest oratory  Yet their port
Not of mean suitors nor important less
Seemed their petition than when the ancient pair
In fables old less ancient yet than these
Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore
The race of mankind drowned before the shrine
Of Themis stood devout  To Heaven their prayers
Flew up nor missed the way by envious winds
Blown vagabond or frustrate in they passed
Dimensionless through heavenly doors then clad
With incense where the golden altar fumed
By their great intercessour came in sight
Before the Fathers throne them the glad Son
Presenting thus to intercede began
See Father what firstfruits on earth are sprung
From thy implanted grace in Man these sighs
And prayers which in this golden censer mixed
With incense I thy priest before thee bring
Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed
Sown with contrition in his heart than those
Which his own hand manuring all the trees
Of Paradise could have produced ere fallen
From innocence  Now therefore bend thine ear
To supplication hear his sighs though mute
Unskilful with what words to pray let me
Interpret for him me his advocate
And propitiation all his works on me
Good or not good ingraft my merit those
Shall perfect and for these my death shall pay
Accept me and in me from these receive
The smell of peace toward mankind let him live
Before thee reconciled at least his days
Numbered though sad till death his doom which I
To mitigate thus plead not to reverse
To better life shall yield him where with me
All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss
Made one with me as I with thee am one
To whom the Father without cloud serene
All thy request for Man accepted Son
Obtain all thy request was my decree
But longer in that Paradise to dwell
The law I gave to Nature him forbids
Those pure immortal elements that know
No gross no unharmonious mixture foul
Eject him tainted now and purge him off
As a distemper gross to air as gross
And mortal food as may dispose him best
For dissolution wrought by sin that first
Distempered all things and of incorrupt
Corrupted  I at first with two fair gifts
Created him endowed with happiness
And immortality that fondly lost
This other served but to eternize woe
Till I provided death so death becomes
His final remedy and after life
Tried in sharp tribulation and refined
By faith and faithful works to second life
Waked in the renovation of the just
Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed
But let us call to synod all the Blest
Through Heavens wide bounds from them I will not hide
My judgements how with mankind I proceed
As how with peccant Angels late they saw
And in their state though firm stood more confirmed
He ended and the Son gave signal high
To the bright minister that watched he blew
His trumpet heard in Oreb since perhaps
When God descended and perhaps once more
To sound at general doom  The angelick blast
Filled all the regions from their blisful bowers
Of amarantine shade fountain or spring
By the waters of life whereer they sat
In fellowships of joy the sons of light
Hasted resorting to the summons high
And took their seats till from his throne supreme
The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will
O Sons like one of us Man is become
To know both good and evil since his taste
Of that defended fruit but let him boast
His knowledge of good lost and evil got
Happier had it sufficed him to have known
Good by itself and evil not at all
He sorrows now repents and prays contrite
My motions in him longer than they move
His heart I know how variable and vain
Selfleft  Lest therefore his now bolder hand
Reach also of the tree of life and eat
And live for ever dream at least to live
For ever to remove him I decree
And send him from the garden forth to till
The ground whence he was taken fitter soil
Michael this my behest have thou in charge
Take to thee from among the Cherubim
Thy choice of flaming warriours lest the Fiend
Or in behalf of Man or to invade
Vacant possession some new trouble raise
Haste thee and from the Paradise of God
Without remorse drive out the sinful pair
From hallowed ground the unholy and denounce
To them and to their progeny from thence
Perpetual banishment  Yet lest they faint
At the sad sentence rigorously urged
For I behold them softened and with tears
Bewailing their excess all terrour hide
If patiently thy bidding they obey
Dismiss them not disconsolate reveal
To Adam what shall come in future days
As I shall thee enlighten intermix
My covenant in the Womans seed renewed
So send them forth though sorrowing yet in peace
And on the east side of the garden place
Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs
Cherubick watch and of a sword the flame
Widewaving all approach far off to fright
And guard all passage to the tree of life
Lest Paradise a receptacle prove
To Spirits foul and all my trees their prey
With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude
He ceased and the archangelick Power prepared
For swift descent with him the cohort bright
Of watchful Cherubim four faces each
Had like a double Janus all their shape
Spangled with eyes more numerous than those
Of Argus and more wakeful than to drouse
Charmed with Arcadian pipe the pastoral reed
Of Hermes or his opiate rod  Mean while
To resalute the world with sacred light
Leucothea waked and with fresh dews imbalmed
The earth when Adam and first matron Eve
Had ended now their orisons and found
Strength added from above new hope to spring
Out of despair joy but with fear yet linked
Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed
Eve easily my faith admit that all
The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends
But that from us aught should ascend to Heaven
So prevalent as to concern the mind
Of God highblest or to incline his will
Hard to belief may seem yet this will prayer
Or one short sigh of human breath upborne
Even to the seat of God  For since I sought
By prayer the offended Deity to appease
Kneeled and before him humbled all my heart
Methought I saw him placable and mild
Bending his ear persuasion in me grew
That I was heard with favour peace returned
Home to my breast and to my memory
His promise that thy seed shall bruise our foe
Which then not minded in dismay yet now
Assures me that the bitterness of death
Is past and we shall live  Whence hail to thee
Eve rightly called mother of all mankind
Mother of all things living since by thee
Man is to live and all things live for Man
To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek
Illworthy I such title should belong
To me transgressour who for thee ordained
A help became thy snare to me reproach
Rather belongs distrust and all dispraise
But infinite in pardon was my Judge
That I who first brought death on all am graced
The source of life next favourable thou
Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsafst
Far other name deserving  But the field
To labour calls us now with sweat imposed
Though after sleepless night for seethe morn
All unconcerned with our unrest begins
Her rosy progress smiling let us forth
I never from thy side henceforth to stray
Whereer our days work lies though now enjoined
Laborious till day droop while here we dwell
What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?
Here let us live though in fallen state content
So spake so wished much humbled Eve but Fate
Subscribed not  Nature first gave signs impressed
On bird beast air air suddenly eclipsed
After short blush of morn nigh in her sight
The bird of Jove stooped from his aery tour
Two birds of gayest plume before him drove
Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods
First hunter then pursued a gentle brace
Goodliest of all the forest hart and hind
Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight
Adam observed and with his eye the chase
Pursuing not unmoved to Eve thus spake
O Eve some further change awaits us nigh
Which Heaven by these mute signs in Nature shows
Forerunners of his purpose or to warn
Us haply too secure of our discharge
From penalty because from death released
Some days how long and what till then our life
Who knows? or more than this that we are dust
And thither must return and be no more?
Why else this double object in our sight
Of flight pursued in the air and oer the ground
One way the selfsame hour? why in the east
Darkness ere days midcourse and morninglight
More orient in yon western cloud that draws
Oer the blue firmament a radiant white
And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?
