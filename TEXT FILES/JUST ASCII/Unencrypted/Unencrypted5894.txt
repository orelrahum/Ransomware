    expansion of welfare benefits The results have been mixed inflation is
    down from doubledigit levels but growth has been sluggish and
    unemployment always a highly sensitive issue has exceeded  since May

Nicaragua Economy

Overview

    private banks have been licensed and the government has liberalized foreign
    trade and abolished price controls on most goods Over  of the
    agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned Sandinista economic
    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis The foundation
    of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities
    largely coffee and cotton Farm production fell by roughly  in  and 
    in  and remained about even in  The agricultural sector employs
     of the work force and accounts for  of GDP and  of export
    earnings Industry which employs  of the work force and contributes
    about  to GDP showed a drop of  in  fell slightly in  and

Niger Economy

Overview
    About  of the population is engaged in farming and stock raising
    activities that generate almost half the national income The economy also
    depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits Uranium
    production grew rapidly in the mids but tapered off in the early s
    when world prices declined France is a major customer while Germany
    Japan and Spain also make regular purchases The depressed demand for
    uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy a severe
    trade imbalance and a mounting external debt
