Cambodia Economy

Overview
    Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic development has been
    stymied by deadly political infighting The economy is based on agriculture
    and related industries Over the past decade Cambodia has been slowly
    recovering from its near destruction by war and political upheaval The food
    situation remains precarious during the s famine was averted only
    through international relief In  the production level of rice the
    staple food crop was able to meet only  of domestic needs The biggest
    success of the nations recovery program has been in new rubber plantings
    and in fishing Industry other than rice processing is almost nonexistent
    Foreign trade has been primarily with the former USSR and Vietnam and both
    trade and foreign aid are being adversely affected by the breakup of the
    USSR Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and unreliable
    Foreign aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has virtually stopped

Cameroon Economy

Overview
    Because of its offshore oil resources Cameroon has one of the highest
    incomes per capita in tropical Africa Still it faces many of the serious
    problems facing other underdeveloped countries such as political
    instability a topheavy civil service and a generally unfavorable climate
    for business enterprise The development of the oil sector led rapid
    economic growth between  and  Growth came to an abrupt halt in 
    precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports coffee
    cocoa and petroleum Export earnings were cut by almost onethird and
    inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed In  with support
    from the IMF and World Bank the government has begun to introduce reforms
    designed to spur business investment increase efficiency in agriculture
    and recapitalize the nations banks Nationwide strikes organized by
    opposition parties in  however undermined these efforts
