  You are not attending said the Mouse to Alice severely
What are you thinking of?

  I beg your pardon said Alice very humbly  you had got to
the fifth bend I think?

  I had NOT cried the Mouse sharply and very angrily

  A knot said Alice always ready to make herself useful and
looking anxiously about her  Oh do let me help to undo it

  I shall do nothing of the sort said the Mouse getting up
and walking away  You insult me by talking such nonsense

  I didnt mean it pleaded poor Alice  But youre so easily
offended you know

  The Mouse only growled in reply

  Please come back and finish your story Alice called after
it and the others all joined in chorus Yes please do but
the Mouse only shook its head impatiently and walked a little
quicker

  What a pity it wouldnt stay sighed the Lory as soon as it
was quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of
saying to her daughter Ah my dear  Let this be a lesson to you
never to lose YOUR temper  Hold your tongue Ma said the
young Crab a little snappishly  Youre enough to try the
patience of an oyster

  I wish I had our Dinah here I know I do said Alice aloud
addressing nobody in particular  Shed soon fetch it back

  And who is Dinah if I might venture to ask the question?
