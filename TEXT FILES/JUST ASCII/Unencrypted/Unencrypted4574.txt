HOOTON prefaced the lengthy discussion that followed with several
comments about modifying an image before one reaches the point of
performing OCR  For example in regard to an application containing a
significant amount of redundant data such as formtype data numerous
companies today are working on various kinds of form renewal prior to
going through a recognition process by using dropout colors  Thus
acquiring access to form design or using electronic means are worth
considering  HOOTON also noted that conversion usually makes or breaks
ones imaging system  It is extremely important extremely costly in
terms of either capital investment or service and determines the quality
of the remainder of ones system because it determines the character of
the raw material used by the system

Concerning the four projects undertaken by NAL two inside and two
performed by outside contractors ZIDAR revealed that an inhouse service
bureau executed the first at a cost between  and  per page for
everything including building of the database  The project undertaken
by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research CGIAR
cost approximately  per page for the conversion plus some expenses
for the software and building of the database  The Acid Rain Projecta
twodisk set produced by the University of Vermont consisting of
Canadian publications on acid raincost  per page for everything
including keying of the text which was double keyed scanning of the
images and building of the database  The inhouse project offered
considerable ease of convenience and greater control of the process  On
the other hand the service bureaus know their job and perform it
expeditiously because they have more people

As a useful comparison ERWAY revealed AMs costs as follows  
cents to  cents per thousand characters with an average page
containing  characters  Requirements for coding and imaging
increase the costs  Thus conversion of the text including the coding
costs approximately  per page  This figure does not include the
imaging and databasebuilding included in the NAL costs  AM also
enjoyed a happy experience with Federal Prison Industries which
precluded the necessity of going through the requestforproposal process
to award a contract because it is another government agency  The
prisoners performed AMs rekeying just as well as other service bureaus
and proved handy as well  AM shipped them the books which they would
photocopy on a bookedge scanner  They would perform the markup on
photocopies return the books as soon as they were done with them
perform the keying and return the material to AM on WORM disks

ZIDAR detailed the elements that constitute the previously noted cost of
approximately  per page  Most significant is the editing correction
of errors and spellcheckings which though they may sound easy to
perform require in fact a great deal of time  Reformatting text also
takes a while but a significant amount of NALs expenses are for equipment
which was extremely expensive when purchased because it was one of the few
systems on the market  The costs of equipment are being amortized over
five years but are still quite high nearly  per month

HOCKEY raised a general question concerning OCR and the amount of editing
required substantial in her experience to generate the kind of
structured markup necessary for manipulating the text on the computer or
loading it into any retrieval system  She wondered if the speakers could
extend the previous question about the costbenefit of adding or exerting
structured markup  ERWAY noted that several OCR systems retain italics
bolding and other spatial formatting  While the material may not be in
the format desired these systems possess the ability to remove the
original materials quickly from the hands of the people performing the
conversion as well as to retain that information so that users can work
with it  HOCKEY rejoined that the current thinking on markup is that one
should not say that something is italic or bold so much as why it is that
way  To be sure one needs to know that something was italicized but
how can one get from one to the other?  One can map from the structure to
the typographic representation

FLEISCHHAUER suggested that given the  million items the Library
holds it may not be possible for LC to do more than report that a thing
was in italics as opposed to why it was italics although that may be
desirable in some contexts  Promising to talk a bit during the afternoon
session about several experiments OCLC performed on automatic recognition
of document elements and which they hoped to extend WEIBEL said that in
fact one can recognize the major elements of a document with a fairly
high degree of reliability at least as good as OCR  STEVENS drew a
useful distinction between standard generalized markup ie defining
for a documenttype definition the structure of the document and what
he termed a style sheet which had to do with italics bolding and other
forms of emphasis  Thus two different components are at work one being
the structure of the document itself its logic and the other being its
representation when it is put on the screen or printed

                                 

SESSION V  APPROACHES TO PREPARING ELECTRONIC TEXTS


HOCKEY  Text in ASCII and the representation of electronic text versus
an image  The need to look at ways of using markup to assist retrieval 
The need for an encoding format that will be reusable and multifunctional


Susan HOCKEY director Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities
CETH Rutgers and Princeton Universities announced that one talk
WEIBELs was moved into this session from the morning and that David
Packard was unable to attend  The session would attempt to focus more on
what one can do with a text in ASCII and the representation of electronic
text rather than just an image what one can do with a computer that
cannot be done with a book or an image  It would be argued that one can
do much more than just read a text and from that starting point one can
use markup and methods of preparing the text to take full advantage of
the capability of the computer  That would lead to a discussion of what
the European Community calls REUSABILITY what may better be termed
DURABILITY that is how to prepare or make a text that will last a long
time and that can be used for as many applications as possible which
would lead to issues of improving intellectual access

HOCKEY urged the need to look at ways of using markup to facilitate retrieval
not just for referencing or to help locate an item that is retrieved but also to put markup tags in
a text to help retrieve the thing sought either with linguistic tagging or
interpretation  HOCKEY also argued that little advancement had occurred in
the software tools currently available for retrieving and searching text
She pressed the desideratum of going beyond Boolean searches and performing
more sophisticated searching which the insertion of more markup in the text
would facilitate  Thinking about electronic texts as opposed to images means
considering material that will never appear in print form or print will not
be its primary form that is material which only appears in electronic form
HOCKEY alluded to the history and the need for markup and tagging and
electronic text which was developed through the use of computers in the
humanities as MICHELSON had observed Father Busa had started in 
to prepare the firstever text on the computer

HOCKEY remarked several large projects particularly in Europe for the
compilation of dictionaries language studies and language analysis in
which people have built up archives of text and have begun to recognize
the need for an encoding format that will be reusable and multifunctional
that can be used not just to print the text which may be assumed to be a
byproduct of what one wants to do but to structure it inside the computer
so that it can be searched built into a Hypertext system etc

                                 


WEIBEL  OCLCs approach to preparing electronic text  retroconversion
keying of texts more automated ways of developing data  Project ADAPT
and the CORE Project  Intelligent character recognition does not exist 
Advantages of SGML  Data should be free of procedural markup
descriptive markup strongly advocated  OCLCs interface illustrated 
Storage requirements and costs for putting a lot of information on line 


Stuart WEIBEL senior research scientist Online Computer Library Center
Inc OCLC described OCLCs approach to preparing electronic text  He
argued that the electronic world into which we are moving must
accommodate not only the future but the past as well and to some degree
even the present  Thus starting out at one end with retroconversion and
keying of texts one would like to move toward much more automated ways
of developing data

For example Project ADAPT had to do with automatically converting
document images into a structured document database with OCR text as
indexing and also a little bit of automatic formatting and tagging of
that text  The CORE project hosted by Cornell University Bellcore
OCLC the American Chemical Society and Chemical Abstracts constitutes
WEIBELs principal concern at the moment  This project is an example of
converting text for which one already has a machinereadable version into
a format more suitable for electronic delivery and database searching
Since Michael LESK had previously described CORE WEIBEL would say
little concerning it  Borrowing a chemical phrase de novo synthesis
WEIBEL cited the Online Journal of Current Clinical Trials as an example
of de novo electronic publishing that is a form in which the primary
form of the information is electronic

Project ADAPT then which OCLC completed a couple of years ago and in
fact is about to resume is a model in which one takes page images either
in paper or microfilm and converts them automatically to a searchable
electronic database either online or local  The operating assumption
is that accepting some blemishes in the data especially for
retroconversion of materials will make it possible to accomplish more
Not enough money is available to support perfect conversion

WEIBEL related several steps taken to perform image preprocessing
processing on the image before performing optical character
recognition as well as image postprocessing  He denied the existence
of intelligent character recognition and asserted that what is wanted is
page recognition which is a long way off  OCLC has experimented with
merging of multiple optical character recognition systems that will
reduce errors from an unacceptable rate of  characters out of every
l to an unacceptable rate of  characters out of every l but it
is not good enough  It will never be perfect

Concerning the CORE Project WEIBEL observed that Bellcore is taking the
topography files extracting the page images and converting those
topography files to SGML markup  LESK hands that data off to OCLC which
builds that data into a Newton database the same system that underlies
the online system in virtually all of the reference products at OCLC
The longterm goal is to make the systems interoperable so that not just
Bellcores system and OCLCs system can access this data but other
systems can as well and the key to that is the Z common command
language and the fulltext extension  Z is fine for MARC records
but is not enough to do it for full text that is make full texts
interoperable

WEIBEL next outlined the critical role of SGML for a variety of purposes
for example as noted by HOCKEY in the world of extremely large
databases using highly structured data to perform field searches
WEIBEL argued that by building the structure of the data in ie the
structure of the data originally on a printed page it becomes easy to
look at a journal article even if one cannot read the characters and know
where the title or author is or what the sections of that document would be
OCLC wants to make that structure explicit in the database because it will
be important for retrieval purposes

The second big advantage of SGML is that it gives one the ability to
build structure into the database that can be used for display purposes
without contaminating the data with instructions about how to format
things  The distinction lies between procedural markup which tells one
where to put dots on the page and descriptive markup which describes
the elements of a document

WEIBEL believes that there should be no procedural markup in the data at
all that the data should be completely unsullied by information about
italics or boldness  That should be left up to the display device
whether that display device is a page printer or a screen display device
By keeping ones database free of that kind of contamination one can
make decisions down the road for example reorganize the data in ways
that are not cramped by builtin notions of what should be italic and
what should be bold  WEIBEL strongly advocated descriptive markup  As
an example he illustrated the index structure in the CORE data  With
subsequent illustrated examples of markup WEIBEL acknowledged the common
complaint that SGML is hard to read in its native form although markup
decreases considerably once one gets into the body  Without the markup
however one would not have the structure in the data  One can pass
markup through a LaTeX processor and convert it relatively easily to a
printed version of the document

WEIBEL next illustrated an extremely cluttered screen dump of OCLCs
system in order to show as much as possible the inherent capability on
the screen  He noted parenthetically that he had become a supporter of
XWindows as a result of the progress of the CORE Project  WEIBEL also
illustrated the two major parts of the interface  l a control box that
allows one to generate lists of items which resembles a small table of
contents based on key words one wishes to search and  a document
viewer which is a separate process in and of itself  He demonstrated
how to follow links through the electronic database simply by selecting
the appropriate button and bringing them up  He also noted problems that
remain to be accommodated in the interface eg as pointed out by LESK
what happens when users do not click on the icon for the figure

Given the constraints of time WEIBEL omitted a large number of ancillary
items in order to say a few words concerning storage requirements and
what will be required to put a lot of things on line  Since it is
extremely expensive to reconvert all of this data especially if it is
just in paper form and even if it is in electronic form in typesetting
tapes he advocated building journals electronically from the start  In
that case if one only has text graphics and indexing which is all that
one needs with de novo electronic publishing because there is no need to
go back and look at bitmaps of pages one can get  journals of
full text or almost  million pages per year  These pages can be put in
approximately  gigabytes of storage which is not all that much
WEIBEL said  For twenty years something less than three terabytes would
be required  WEIBEL calculated the costs of storing this information as
follows  If a gigabyte costs approximately  then a terabyte costs
approximately  million to buy in terms of hardware  One also needs a
building to put it in and a staff like OCLC to handle that information
So to support a terabyte multiply by five which gives  million per
year for a supported terabyte of data

                                 


DISCUSSION  Tapes saved by ACS are the typography files originally
supporting publication of the journal  Cost of building tagged text into
the database 


During the questionandanswer period that followed WEIBELs
presentation these clarifications emerged  The tapes saved by the
American Chemical Society are the typography files that originally
supported the publication of the journal  Although they are not tagged
in SGML they are tagged in very fine detail  Every single sentence is
marked all the registry numbers all the publications issues dates and
volumes  No cost figures on tagging material on a permegabyte basis
were available  Because ACSs typesetting system runs from tagged text
there is no extra cost per article  It was unknown what it costs ACS to
keyboard the tagged text rather than just keyboard the text in the
cheapest process  In other words since one intends to publish things
and will need to build tagged text into a typography system in any case
if one does that in such a way that it can drive not only typography but
an electronic system which is what ACS intends to domove to SGML
publishing the marginal cost is zero  The marginal cost represents the
cost of building tagged text into the database which is small

                                 


SPERBERGMcQUEEN  Distinction between texts and computers  Implications
of recognizing that all representation is encoding  Dealing with
complicated representations of text entails the need for a grammar of
documents  Variety of forms of formal grammars  Text as a bitmapped
image does not represent a serious attempt to represent text in
electronic form  SGML the TEI documenttype declarations and the
reusability and longevity of data  TEI conformance explicitly allows
extension or modification of the TEI tag set  Administrative background
of the TEI  Several design goals for the TEI tag set  An absolutely
fixed requirement of the TEI Guidelines  Challenges the TEI has
attempted to face  Good texts not beyond economic feasibility  The
issue of reproducibility or processability  The issue of mages as
simulacra for the text redux  Ones model of text determines what ones
software can do with a text and has economic consequences 


Prior to speaking about SGML and markup Michael SPERBERGMcQUEEN editor
Text Encoding Initiative TEI University of IllinoisChicago first drew
a distinction between texts and computers  Texts are abstract cultural
and linguistic objects while computers are complicated physical devices
he said  Abstract objects cannot be placed inside physical devices with
computers one can only represent text and act upon those representations

The recognition that all representation is encoding SPERBERGMcQUEEN
argued leads to the recognition of two things   The topic description
for this session is slightly misleading because there can be no discussion
of pros and cons of textcoding unless what one means is pros and cons of
working with text with computers   No text can be represented in a
computer without some sort of encoding images are one way of encoding text
ASCII is another SGML yet another  There is no encoding without some
information loss that is there is no perfect reproduction of a text that
allows one to do away with the original  Thus the question becomes
What is the most useful representation of text for a serious work?
This depends on what kind of serious work one is talking about

The projects demonstrated the previous day all involved highly complex
information and fairly complex manipulation of the textual material
In order to use that complicated information one has to calculate it
slowly or manually and store the result  It needs to be stored therefore
as part of ones representation of the text  Thus one needs to store the
structure in the text  To deal with complicated representations of text
one needs somehow to control the complexity of the representation of a text
that means one needs a way of finding out whether a document and an
electronic representation of a document is legal or not and that
means one needs a grammar of documents

SPERBERGMcQUEEN discussed the variety of forms of formal grammars
implicit and explicit as applied to text and their capabilities  He
argued that these grammars correspond to different models of text that
different developers have  For example one implicit model of the text
is that there is no internal structure but just one thing after another
a few characters and then perhaps a starttitle command and then a few
more characters and an endtitle command  SPERBERGMcQUEEN also
distinguished several kinds of text that have a sort of hierarchical
structure that is not very well defined which typically corresponds
to grammars that are not very well defined as well as hierarchies that
are very well defined eg the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae and extremely
complicated things such as SGML which handle strictly hierarchical data
very nicely

SPERBERGMcQUEEN conceded that one other model not illustrated on his two
displays was the model of text as a bitmapped image an image of a page
and confessed to having been converted to a limited extent by the
Workshop to the view that electronic images constitute a promising
probably superior alternative to microfilming  But he was not convinced
that electronic images represent a serious attempt to represent text in
electronic form  Many of their problems stem from the fact that they are
not direct attempts to represent the text but attempts to represent the
page thus making them representations of representations

In this situation of increasingly complicated textual information and the
need to control that complexity in a useful way which begs the question
of the need for good textual grammars one has the introduction of SGML
With SGML one can develop specific documenttype declarations
for specific text types or as with the TEI attempts to generate
general documenttype declarations that can handle all sorts of text
The TEI is an attempt to develop formats for text representation that
will ensure the kind of reusability and longevity of data discussed earlier
It offers a way to stay alive in the state of permanent technological
revolution

It has been a continuing challenge in the TEI to create document grammars
that do some work in controlling the complexity of the textual object but
also allowing one to represent the real text that one will find
Fundamental to the notion of the TEI is that TEI conformance allows one
the ability to extend or modify the TEI tag set so that it fits the text
that one is attempting to represent

SPERBERGMcQUEEN next outlined the administrative background of the TEI
The TEI is an international project to develop and disseminate guidelines
for the encoding and interchange of machinereadable text  It is
sponsored by the Association for Computers in the Humanities the
Association for Computational Linguistics and the Association for
Literary and Linguistic Computing  Representatives of numerous other
professional societies sit on its advisory board  The TEI has a number
of affiliated projects that have provided assistance by testing drafts of
the guidelines

Among the design goals for the TEI tag set the scheme first of all must
meet the needs of research because the TEI came out of the research
community which did not feel adequately served by existing tag sets
The tag set must be extensive as well as compatible with existing and
emerging standards  In  version  of the Guidelines was released
SPERBERGMcQUEEN illustrated their contents

SPERBERGMcQUEEN noted that one problem besetting electronic text has
been the lack of adequate internal or external documentation for many
existing electronic texts  The TEI guidelines as currently formulated
contain few fixed requirements but one of them is this  There must
always be a document header an infile SGML tag that provides
 a bibliographic description of the electronic object one is talking
about that is who included it when what for and under which title
and  the copy text from which it was derived if any  If there was
no copy text or if the copy text is unknown then one states as much
Version  of the Guidelines was scheduled to be completed in fall 
and a revised third version is to be presented to the TEI advisory board
for its endorsement this coming winter  The TEI itself exists to provide
a markup language not a markedup text

Among the challenges the TEI has attempted to face is the need for a
markup language that will work for existing projects that is handle the
level of markup that people are using now to tag only chapter section
and paragraph divisions and not much else  At the same time such a
language also will be able to scale up gracefully to handle the highly
detailed markup which many people foresee as the future destination of
much electronic text and which is not the future destination but the
present home of numerous electronic texts in specialized areas

SPERBERGMcQUEEN dismissed the lowestcommondenominator approach as
unable to support the kind of applications that draw people who have
never been in the public library regularly before and make them come
back  He advocated more interesting text and more intelligent text
Asserting that it is not beyond economic feasibility to have good texts
SPERBERGMcQUEEN noted that the TEI Guidelines listing odd tags
contains tags that one is expected to enter every time the relevant
textual feature occurs  It contains all the tags that people need now
and it is not expected that everyone will tag things in the same way

The question of how people will tag the text is in large part a function
of their reaction to what SPERBERGMcQUEEN termed the issue of
reproducibility  What one needs to be able to reproduce are the things
one wants to work with  Perhaps a more useful concept than that of
reproducibility or recoverability is that of processability that is
what can one get from an electronic text without reading it again
in the original  He illustrated this contention with a page from
Jan Comeniuss bilingual Introduction to Latin

SPERBERGMcQUEEN returned at length to the issue of images as simulacra
for the text in order to reiterate his belief that in the long run more
than images of pages of particular editions of the text are needed
because just as secondgeneration photocopies and secondgeneration
microfilm degenerate so secondgeneration representations tend to
degenerate and one tends to overstress some relatively trivial aspects
of the text such as its layout on the page which is not always
significant despite what the text critics might say and slight other
pieces of information such as the very important lexical ties between the
English and Latin versions of Comeniuss bilingual text for example
Moreover in many crucial respects it is easy to fool oneself concerning
what a scanned image of the text will accomplish  For example in order
to study the transmission of texts information concerning the text
carrier is necessary which scanned images simply do not always handle
Further even the highquality materials being produced at Cornell use
much of the information that one would need if studying those books as
physical objects  It is a choice that has been made  It is an arguably
justifiable choice but one does not know what color those pen strokes in
the margin are or whether there was a stain on the page because it has
been filtered out  One does not know whether there were rips in the page
because they do not show up and on a couple of the marginal marks one
loses half of the mark because the pen is very light and the scanner
failed to pick it up and so what is clearly a checkmark in the margin of
the original becomes a little scoop in the margin of the facsimile
Standard problems for facsimile editions not new to electronics but
also true of lightlens photography and are remarked here because it is
important that we not fool ourselves that even if we produce a very nice
image of this page with good contrast we are not replacing the
manuscript any more than microfilm has replaced the manuscript

The TEI comes from the research community where its first allegiance
lies but it is not just an academic exercise  It has relevance far
beyond those who spend all of their time studying text because ones
model of text determines what ones software can do with a text  Good
models lead to good software  Bad models lead to bad software  That has
economic consequences and it is these economic consequences that have
led the European Community to help support the TEI and that will lead
SPERBERGMcQUEEN hoped some software vendors to realize that if they
provide software with a better model of the text they can make a killing

                                 


DISCUSSION  Implications of different DTDs and tag sets  ODA versus SGML 


During the discussion that followed several additional points were made
Neither AAP ie Association of American Publishers nor CALS ie
Computeraided Acquisition and Logistics Support has a documenttype
definition for ancient Greek drama although the TEI will be able to
handle that  Given this state of affairs and assuming that the
technicaljournal producers and the commercial vendors decide to use the
other two types then an institution like the Library of Congress which
might receive all of their publications would have to be able to handle
three different types of document definitions and tag sets and be able to
distinguish among them

Office Document Architecture ODA has some advantages that flow from its
tight focus on office documents and clear directions for implementation
Much of the ODA standard is easier to read and clearer at first reading
than the SGML standard which is extremely general  What that means is
that if one wants to use graphics in TIFF and ODA one is stuck because
ODA defines graphics formats while TIFF does not whereas SGML says the
world is not waiting for this work group to create another graphics format
What is needed is an ability to use whatever graphics format one wants

The TEI provides a socket that allows one to connect the SGML document to
the graphics  The notation that the graphics are in is clearly a choice
that one needs to make based on her or his environment and that is one
advantage  SGML is less megalomaniacal in attempting to define formats
for all kinds of information though more megalomaniacal in attempting to
cover all sorts of documents  The other advantage is that the model of
text represented by SGML is simply an order of magnitude richer and more
flexible than the model of text offered by ODA  Both offer hierarchical
structures but SGML recognizes that the hierarchical model of the text
that one is looking at may not have been in the minds of the designers
whereas ODA does not

ODA is not really aiming for the kind of document that the TEI wants to
encompass  The TEI can handle the kind of material ODA has as well as a
significantly broader range of material  ODA seems to be very much
focused on office documents which is what it started out being called
office document architecture

                                 


CALALUCA  Textencoding from a publishers perspective 
Responsibilities of a publisher  Reproduction of Mignes Latin series
whole and complete with SGML tags based on perceived need and expected
use  Particular decisions arising from the general decision to produce
and publish PLD 


The final speaker in this session Eric CALALUCA vice president
ChadwyckHealey Inc spoke from the perspective of a publisher re
textencoding rather than as one qualified to discuss methods of
encoding data and observed that the presenters sitting in the room
whether they had chosen to or not were acting as publishers  making
choices gathering data gathering information and making assessments
CALALUCA offered the hardwon conviction that in publishing very large
text files such as PLD one cannot avoid making personal judgments of
appropriateness and structure

In CALALUCAs view encoding decisions stem from prior judgments  Two
notions have become axioms for him in the consideration of future sources
for electronic publication   electronic text publishing is as personal
as any other kind of publishing and questions of if and how to encode
the data are simply a consequence of that prior decision   all
personal decisions are open to criticism which is unavoidable

CALALUCA rehearsed his role as a publisher or better as an intermediary
between what is viewed as a sound idea and the people who would make use
of it  Finding the specialist to advise in this process is the core of
that function  The publisher must monitor and hug the fine line between
giving users what they want and suggesting what they might need  One
responsibility of a publisher is to represent the desires of scholars and
research librarians as opposed to bullheadedly forcing them into areas
they would not choose to enter

CALALUCA likened the questions being raised today about data structure
and standards to the decisions faced by the Abbe Migne himself during
production of the Patrologia series in the midnineteenth century
ChadwyckHealeys decision to reproduce Mignes Latin series whole and
complete with SGML tags was also based upon a perceived need and an
expected use  In the same way that Mignes work came to be far more than
a simple handbook for clerics PLD is already far more than a database
for theologians  It is a bedrock source for the study of Western
civilization CALALUCA asserted

In regard to the decision to produce and publish PLD the editorial board
offered direct judgments on the question of appropriateness of these
texts for conversion their encoding and their distribution and
concluded that the best possible project was one that avoided overt
intrusions or exclusions in so important a resource  Thus the general
decision to transmit the original collection as clearly as possible with
the widest possible avenues for use led to other decisions   To encode
the data or not SGML or not TEI or not  Again the expected user
community asserted the need for normative tagging structures of important
humanities texts and the TEI seemed the most appropriate structure for
that purpose  Research librarians who are trained to view the larger
impact of electronic text sources on  or  or  doctoral
disciplines loudly approved the decision to include tagging  They see
what is coming better than the specialist who is completely focused on
one edition of Ambroses De Anima and they also understand that the
potential uses exceed present expectations   What will be tagged and
what will not  Once again the board realized that one must tag the
obvious  But in no way should one attempt to identify through encoding
schemes every single discrete area of a text that might someday be
searched  That was another decision  Searching by a column number an
author a word a volume permitting combination searches and tagging
notations seemed logical choices as core elements   How does one make
the data available?  Tieing it to a CDROM edition creates limitations
but a magnetic tape file that is very large is accompanied by the
encoding specifications and that allows one to make local modifications
also allows one to incorporate any changes one may desire within the
bounds of private research though exporting tag files from a CDROM
could serve just as well  Since no one on the board could possibly
anticipate each and every way in which a scholar might choose to mine
this data bank it was decided to satisfy the basics and make some
provisions for what might come   Not to encode the database would rob
it of the interchangeability and portability these important texts should
accommodate  For CALALUCA the extensive options presented by fulltext
searching require care in text selection and strongly support encoding of
data to facilitate the widest possible search strategies  Better
software can always be created but summoning the resources the people
and the energy to reconvert the text is another matter

PLD is being encoded captured and distributed because to
ChadwyckHealey and the board it offers the widest possible array of
future research applications that can be seen today  CALALUCA concluded
by urging the encoding of all important text sources in whatever way
seems most appropriate and durable at the time without blanching at the
thought that ones work may require emendation in the future  Thus
ChadwyckHealey produced a very large humanities text database before the
final release of the TEI Guidelines

                                 


DISCUSSION  Creating texts with markup advocated  Trends in encoding 
The TEI and the issue of interchangeability of standards  A
misconception concerning the TEI  Implications for an institution like
LC in the event that a multiplicity of DTDs develops  Producing images
as a first step towards possible conversion to full text through
character recognition  The AAP tag sets as a common starting point and
the need for caution 


HOCKEY prefaced the discussion that followed with several comments in
favor of creating texts with markup and on trends in encoding  In the
future when many more texts are available for online searching real
problems in finding what is wanted will develop if one is faced with
millions of words of data  It therefore becomes important to consider
putting markup in texts to help searchers home in on the actual things
they wish to retrieve  Various approaches to refining retrieval methods
toward this end include building on a computer version of a dictionary
and letting the computer look up words in it to obtain more information
about the semantic structure or semantic field of a word its grammatical
structure and syntactic structure

HOCKEY commented on the present keen interest in the encoding world
in creating   machinereadable versions of dictionaries that can be
initially tagged in SGML which gives a structure to the dictionary entry
these entries can then be converted into a more rigid or otherwise
different database structure inside the computer which can be treated as
a dynamic tool for searching mechanisms  large bodies of text to study
the language  In order to incorporate more sophisticated mechanisms
more about how words behave needs to be known which can be learned in
part from information in dictionaries  However the last ten years have
seen much interest in studying the structure of printed dictionaries
converted into computerreadable form  The information one derives about
many words from those is only partial one or two definitions of the
common or the usual meaning of a word and then numerous definitions of
unusual usages  If the computer is using a dictionary to help retrieve
words in a text it needs much more information about the common usages
because those are the ones that occur over and over again  Hence the
current interest in developing large bodies of text in computerreadable
form in order to study the language  Several projects are engaged in
compiling for example  million words HOCKEY described one with
which she was associated briefly at Oxford University involving
compilation of  million words of British English  about  percent of
that will contain detailed linguistic tagging encoded in SGML it will
have word class taggings with words identified as nouns verbs
adjectives or other parts of speech  This tagging can then be used by
programs which will begin to learn a bit more about the structure of the
language and then can go to tag more text

HOCKEY said that the more that is tagged accurately the more one can
refine the tagging process and thus the bigger body of text one can build
up with linguistic tagging incorporated into it  Hence the more tagging
or annotation there is in the text the more one may begin to learn about
language and the more it will help accomplish more intelligent OCR  She
recommended the development of software tools that will help one begin to
understand more about a text which can then be applied to scanning
images of that text in that format and to using more intelligence to help
one interpret or understand the text

HOCKEY posited the need to think about common methods of textencoding
for a long time to come because building these large bodies of text is
extremely expensive and will only be done once

In the more general discussion on approaches to encoding that followed
these points were made

BESSER identified the underlying problem with standards that all have to
struggle with in adopting a standard namely the tension between a very
highly defined standard that is very interchangeable but does not work
for everyone because something is lacking and a standard that is less
defined more open more adaptable but less interchangeable  Contending
that the way in which people use SGML is not sufficiently defined BESSER
wondered  if people resist the TEI because they think it is too defined
in certain things they do not fit into and  how progress with
interchangeability can be made without frightening people away

SPERBERGMcQUEEN replied that the published drafts of the TEI had met
with surprisingly little objection on the grounds that they do not allow
one to handle X or Y or Z  Particular concerns of the affiliated
projects have led in practice to discussions of how extensions are to
be made the primary concern of any project has to be how it can be
represented locally thus making interchange secondary  The TEI has
received much criticism based on the notion that everything in it is
required or even recommended which as it happens is a misconception
from the beginning   because none of it is required and very little is
actually actively recommended for all cases except that one document
ones source

SPERBERGMcQUEEN agreed with BESSER about this tradeoff  all the
projects in a set of twenty TEIconformant projects will not necessarily
tag the material in the same way  One result of the TEI will be that the
easiest problems will be solvedthose dealing with the external form of
the information but the problem that is hardest in interchange is that
one is not encoding what another wants and vice versa  Thus after
the adoption of a common notation the differences in the underlying
conceptions of what is interesting about texts become more visible
The success of a standard like the TEI will lie in the ability of
the recipient of interchanged texts to use some of what it contains
and to add the information that was not encoded that one wants in a
layered way so that texts can be gradually enriched and one does not
have to put in everything all at once  Hence having a wellbehaved
markup scheme is important

STEVENS followed up on the paradoxical analogy that BESSER alluded to in
the example of the MARC records namely the formats that are the same
except that they are different  STEVENS drew a parallel between
documenttype definitions and MARC records for books and serials and maps
where one has a tagging structure and there is a textinterchange
STEVENS opined that the producers of the information will set the terms
for the standard ie develop documenttype definitions for the users
of their products creating a situation that will be problematical for
an institution like the Library of Congress which will have to deal with
the DTDs in the event that a multiplicity of them develops  Thus
numerous people are seeking a standard but cannot find the tag set that
will be acceptable to them and their clients  SPERBERGMcQUEEN agreed
with this view and said that the situation was in a way worse  attempting
to unify arbitrary DTDs resembled attempting to unify a MARC record with a
bibliographic record done according to the Prussian instructions
According to STEVENS this situation occurred very early in the process

WATERS recalled from early discussions on Project Open Book the concern
of many people that merely by producing images POB was not really
enhancing intellectual access to the material  Nevertheless not wishing
to overemphasize the opposition between imaging and full text WATERS
stated that POB views getting the images as a first step toward possibly
converting to full text through character recognition if the technology
is appropriate  WATERS also emphasized that encoding is involved even
with a set of images

SPERBERGMcQUEEN agreed with WATERS that one can create an SGML document
consisting wholly of images  At first sight organizing graphic images
with an SGML document may not seem to offer great advantages but the
advantages of the scheme WATERS described would be precisely that
ability to move into something that is more of a multimedia document
a combination of transcribed text and page images  WEIBEL concurred in
this judgment offering evidence from Project ADAPT where a page is
divided into text elements and graphic elements and in fact the text
elements are organized by columns and lines  These lines may be used as
the basis for distributing documents in a network environment  As one
develops software intelligent enough to recognize what those elements
are it makes sense to apply SGML to an image initially that may in
fact ultimately become more and more text either through OCR or edited
OCR or even just through keying  For WATERS the labor of composing the
document and saying this set of documents or this set of images belongs
to this document constitutes a significant investment

WEIBEL also made the point that the AAP tag sets while not excessively
prescriptive offer a common starting point they do not define the
structure of the documents though  They have some recommendations about
DTDs one could use as examples but they do just suggest tag sets   For
example the CORE project attempts to use the AAP markup as much as
possible but there are clearly areas where structure must be added
That in no way contradicts the use of AAP tag sets

SPERBERGMcQUEEN noted that the TEI prepared a long working paper early
on about the AAP tag set and what it lacked that the TEI thought it
needed and a fairly long critique of the naming conventions which has
led to a very different style of naming in the TEI  He stressed the
importance of the opposition between prescriptive markup the kind that a
publisher or anybody can do when producing documents de novo and
descriptive markup in which one has to take what the text carrier
provides  In these particular tag sets it is easy to overemphasize this
opposition because the AAP tag set is extremely flexible  Even if one
just used the DTDs they allow almost anything to appear almost anywhere

                                 

SESSION VI  COPYRIGHT ISSUES


PETERS  Several cautions concerning copyright in an electronic
environment  Review of copyright law in the United States  The notion
of the public good and the desirability of incentives to promote it 
What copyright protects  Works not protected by copyright  The rights
of copyright holders  Publishers concerns in todays electronic
environment  Compulsory licenses  The price of copyright in a digital
medium and the need for cooperation  Additional clarifications   Rough
justice oftentimes the outcome in numerous copyright matters  Copyright
in an electronic society  Copyright law always only sets up the
boundaries anything can be changed by contract 


Marybeth PETERS policy planning adviser to the Register of Copyrights
Library of Congress   made several general comments and then opened the
floor to discussion of subjects of interest to the audience

Having attended several sessions in an effort to gain a sense of what
people did and where copyright would affect their lives PETERS expressed
the following cautions

      If one takes and converts materials and puts them in new forms
     then from a copyright point of view one is creating something and
     will receive some rights

      However if what one is converting already exists a question
     immediately arises about the status of the materials in question

      Putting something in the public domain in the United States offers
     some freedom from anxiety but distributing it throughout the world
     on a network is another matter even if one has put it in the public
     domain in the United States  Re foreign laws very frequently a
     work can be in the public domain in the United States but protected
     in other countries  Thus one must consider all of the places a
     work may reach lest one unwittingly become liable to being faced
     with a suit for copyright infringement or at least a letter
     demanding discussion of what one is doing

PETERS reviewed copyright law in the United States  The US
Constitution effectively states that Congress has the power to enact
copyright laws for two purposes   to encourage the creation and
dissemination of intellectual works for the good of society as a whole
and significantly  to give creators and those who package and
disseminate materials the economic rewards that are due them

Congress strives to strike a balance which at times can become an
emotional issue  The United States has never accepted the notion of the
natural right of an author so much as it has accepted the notion of the
public good and the desirability of incentives to promote it  This state
of affairs however has created strains on the international level and
is the reason for several of the differences in the laws that we have
Today the United States protects almost every kind of work that can be
called an expression of an author  The standard for gaining copyright
protection is simply originality  This is a low standard and means that
a work is not copied from something else as well as shows a certain
minimal amount of authorship  One can also acquire copyright protection
for making a new version of preexisting material provided it manifests
some spark of creativity

However copyright does not protect ideas methods systemsonly the way
that one expresses those things  Nor does copyright protect anything
that is mechanical anything that does not involve choice or criteria
concerning whether or not one should do a thing  For example the
results of a process called declicking in which one mechanically removes
impure sounds from old recordings are not copyrightable  On the other
hand the choice to record a song digitally and to increase the sound of
violins or to bring up the tympani constitutes the results of conversion
that are copyrightable  Moreover if a work is protected by copyright in
the United States one generally needs the permission of the copyright
owner to convert it  Normally who will own the newthat is converted
material is a matter of contract  In the absence of a contract the
person who creates the new material is the author and owner  But people
do not generally think about the copyright implications until after the
fact  PETERS stressed the need when dealing with copyrighted works to
think about copyright in advance  Ones bargaining power is much greater
up front than it is down the road

PETERS next discussed works not protected by copyright for example any
work done by a federal employee as part of his or her official duties is
in the public domain in the United States  The issue is not wholly free
of doubt concerning whether or not the work is in the public domain
outside the United States  Other materials in the public domain include
any works published more than seventyfive years ago and any work
published in the United States more than twentyeight years ago whose
copyright was not renewed  In talking about the new technology and
putting material in a digital form to send all over the world PETERS
cautioned one must keep in mind that while the rights may not be an
issue in the United States they may be in different parts of the world
where most countries previously employed a copyright term of the life of
the author plus fifty years

PETERS next reviewed the economics of copyright holding  Simply
economic rights are the rights to control the reproduction of a work in
any form  They belong to the author or in the case of a work made for
hire the employer  The second right which is critical to conversion
is the right to change a work  The right to make new versions is perhaps
one of the most significant rights of authors particularly in an
electronic world  The third right is the right to publish the work and
the right to disseminate it something that everyone who deals in an
electronic medium needs to know  The basic rule is if a copy is sold
all rights of distribution are extinguished with the sale of that copy
The key is that it must be sold  A number of companies overcome this
obstacle by leasing or renting their product  These companies argue that
if the material is rented or leased and not sold they control the uses
of a work  The fourth right and one very important in a digital world
is a right of public performance which means the right to show the work
sequentially  For example copyright owners control the showing of a
CDROM product in a public place such as a public library  The reverse
side of public performance is something called the right of public
display  Moral rights also exist which at the federal level apply only
to very limited visual works of art but in theory may apply under
contract and other principles  Moral rights may include the right of an
author to have his or her name on a work the right of attribution and
the right to object to distortion or mutilationthe right of integrity

The way copyright law is worded gives much latitude to activities such as
preservation to use of material for scholarly and research purposes when
the user does not make multiple copies and to the generation of
facsimile copies of unpublished works by libraries for themselves and
other libraries  But the law does not allow anyone to become the
distributor of the product for the entire world  In todays electronic
environment publishers are extremely concerned that the entire world is
networked and can obtain the information desired from a single copy in a
single library  Hence if there is to be only one sale which publishers
may choose to live with they will obtain their money in other ways for
example from access and use  Hence the development of site licenses
and other kinds of agreements to cover what publishers believe they
should be compensated for  Any solution that the United States takes
today has to consider the international arena

Noting that the United States is a member of the Berne Convention and
subscribes to its provisions PETERS described the permissions process
She also defined compulsory licenses  A compulsory license of which the
United States has had a few builds into the law the right to use a work
subject to certain terms and conditions  In the international arena
however the ability to use compulsory licenses is extremely limited
Thus clearinghouses and other collectives comprise one option that has
succeeded in providing for use of a work  Often overlooked when one
begins to use copyrighted material and put products together is how
expensive the permissions process and managing it is  According to
PETERS the price of copyright in a digital medium whatever solution is
worked out will include managing and assembling the database  She
strongly recommended that publishers and librarians or people with
various backgrounds cooperate to work out administratively feasible
systems in order to produce better results

In the lengthy questionandanswer period that followed PETERSs
presentation the following points emerged

      The Copyright Office maintains that anything mechanical and
     totally exhaustive probably is not protected  In the event that
     what an individual did in developing potentially copyrightable
     material is not understood the Copyright Office will ask about the
     creative choices the applicant chose to make or not to make  As a
     practical matter if one believes she or he has made enough of those
     choices that person has a right to assert a copyright and someone
     else must assert that the work is not copyrightable  The more
     mechanical the more automatic a thing is the less likely it is to
     be copyrightable

      Nearly all photographs are deemed to be copyrightable but no one
     worries about them much because everyone is free to take the same
     image  Thus a photographic copyright represents what is called a
     "thin" copyright  The photograph itself must be duplicated in
     order for copyright to be violated

      The Copyright Office takes the position that Xrays are not
     copyrightable because they are mechanical  It  can be argued
     whether or not image enhancement in scanning can be protected  One
     must exercise care with material created with public funds and
     generally in the public domain  An article written by a federal
     employee if written as part of official duties is not
     copyrightable  However control over a scientific article written
     by a National Institutes of Health grantee ie someone who
     receives money from the US government depends on NIH policy  If
     the government agency has no policy and that policy can be
     contained in its regulations the contract or the grant the
     author retains copyright  If a provision of the contract grant or
     regulation states that there will be no copyright then it does not
     exist  When a work is created copyright automatically comes into
     existence unless something exists that says it does not

      An enhanced electronic copy of a print copy of an older reference
     work in the public domain that does not contain copyrightable new
     material is a purely mechanical rendition of the original work and
     is not copyrightable

      Usually when a work enters the public domain nothing can remove
     it  For example Congress recently passed into law the concept of
     automatic renewal which means that copyright on any work published
     between l and l does not have to be renewed in order to
     receive a seventyfiveyear term  But any work not renewed before
      is in the public domain

      Concerning whether or not the United States keeps track of when
     authors die nothing was ever done nor is anything being done at
     the moment by the Copyright Office

      Software that drives a mechanical process is itself copyrightable
     If one changes platforms the software itself has a copyright  The
     World Intellectual Property Organization will hold a symposium 
     March through  April l at Harvard University on digital
     technology and will study this entire issue  If one purchases a
     computer software package such as MacPaint and creates something
     new one receives protection only for that which has been added

PETERS added that often in copyright matters rough justice is the
outcome for example in collective licensing ASCAP ie American
Society of Composers Authors and Publishers and BMI ie Broadcast
Music Inc where it may seem that the big guys receive more than their
due  Of course people ought not to copy a creative product without
paying for it there should be some compensation  But the truth of the
world and it is not a great truth is that the big guy gets played on
the radio more frequently than the little guy who has to do much more
until he becomes a big guy  That is true of every author every
composer everyone and unfortunately is part of life

Copyright always originates with the author except in cases of works
made for hire  Most software falls into this category  When an author
sends his article to a journal he has not relinquished copyright though
he retains the right to relinquish it  The author receives absolutely
everything  The less prominent the author the more leverage the
publisher will have in contract negotiations  In order to transfer the
rights the author must sign an agreement giving them away

In an electronic society it is important to be able to license a writer
and work out deals  With regard to use of a work it usually is much
easier when a publisher holds the rights  In an electronic era a real
problem arises when one is digitizing and making information available
PETERS referred again to electronic licensing clearinghouses  Copyright
ought to remain with the author but as one moves forward globally in the
electronic arena a middleman who can handle the various rights becomes
increasingly necessary

The notion of copyright law is that it resides with the individual but
in an online environment where a work can be adapted and tinkered with
by many individuals there is concern  If changes are authorized and
there is no agreement to the contrary the person who changes a work owns
the changes  To put it another way the person who acquires permission
to change a work technically will become the author and the owner unless
some agreement to the contrary has been made  It is typical for the
original publisher to try to control all of the versions and all of the
uses  Copyright law always only sets up the boundaries  Anything can be
changed by contract

                                 

SESSION VII  CONCLUSION


GENERAL DISCUSSION  Two questions for discussion  Different emphases in
the Workshop  Bringing the text and image partisans together 
Desiderata in planning the longterm development of something  Questions
surrounding the issue of electronic deposit  Discussion of electronic
deposit as an allusion to the issue of standards  Need for a directory
of preservation projects in digital form and for access to their
digitized files  CETHs catalogue of machinereadable texts in the
humanities  What constitutes a publication in the electronic world? 
Need for LC to deal with the concept of online publishing  LCs Network
Development Office  exploring the limits of MARC as a standard in terms
of handling electronic information  Magnitude of the problem and the
need for distributed responsibility in order to maintain and store
electronic information  Workshop participants to be viewed as a starting
point  Development of a network version of AM urged  A step toward AMs
construction of some sort of apparatus for network access  A delicate
and agonizing policy question for LC  Re the issue of electronic
deposit LC urged to initiate a catalytic process in terms of distributed
responsibility  Suggestions for cooperative ventures  Commercial
publishers fears  Strategic questions for getting the image and text
people to think through longterm cooperation  Clarification of the
driving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects 


In his role as moderator of the concluding session GIFFORD raised two
questions he believed would benefit from discussion   Are there enough
commonalities among those of us that have been here for two days so that
we can see courses of action that should be taken in the future?  And if
so what are they and who might take them?   Partly derivative from
that but obviously very dangerous to LC as host do you see a role for
the Library of Congress in all this?  Of course the Library of Congress
holds a rather special status in a number of these matters because it is
not perceived as a player with an economic stake in them but are there
roles that LC can play that can help advance us toward where we are heading?

Describing himself as an uninformed observer of the technicalities of the
last two days GIFFORD detected three different emphases in the Workshop
 people who are very deeply committed to text  people who are almost
passionate about images and  a few people who are very committed to
what happens to the networks  In other words the new networking
dimension the accessibility of the processability the portability of
all this across the networks  How do we pull those three together?

Adding a question that reflected HOCKEYs comment that this was the
fourth workshop she had attended in the previous thirty days FLEISCHHAUER
wondered to what extent this meeting had reinvented the wheel or if it
had contributed anything in the way of bringing together a different group
of people from those who normally appear on the workshop circuit

HOCKEY confessed to being struck at this meeting and the one the
Electronic Pierce Consortium organized the previous week that this was a
coming together of people working on texts and not images  Attempting to
bring the two together is something we ought to be thinking about for the
future  How one can think about working with image material to begin
with but structuring it and digitizing it in such a way that at a later
stage it can be interpreted into text and find a common way of building
text and images together so that they can be used jointly in the future
with the network support to begin there because that is how people will
want to access it

In planning the longterm development of something which is what is
being done in electronic text HOCKEY stressed the importance not only
of discussing the technical aspects of how one does it but particularly
of thinking about what the people who use the stuff will want to do
But conversely there are numerous things that people start to do with
electronic text or material that nobody ever thought of in the beginning

LESK in response to the question concerning the role of the Library of
Congress remarked the often suggested desideratum of having electronic
deposit  Since everything is now computertypeset an entire decade of
material that was machinereadable exists but the publishers frequently
did not save it has LC taken any action to have its copyright deposit
operation start collecting these machinereadable versions?  In the
absence of PETERS GIFFORD replied that the question was being
actively considered but that that was only one dimension of the problem
Another dimension is the whole question of the integrity of the original
electronic document  It becomes highly important in science to prove
authorship  How will that be done?

ERWAY explained that under the old policy to make a claim for a
copyright for works that were published in electronic form including
software one had to submit a paper copy of the first and last twenty
pages of codesomething that represented the work but did not include
the entire work itself and had little value to anyone  As a temporary
measure LC has claimed the right to demand electronic versions of
electronic publications  This measure entails a proactive role for the
Library to say that it wants a particular electronic version  Publishers
then have perhaps a year to submit it  But the real problem for LC is
what to do with all this material in all these different formats  Will
the Library mount it?  How will it give people access to it?  How does LC
