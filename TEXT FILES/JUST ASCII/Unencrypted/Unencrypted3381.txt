Andorra Economy

Overview
    The mainstay of Andorras economy is tourism An estimated  million
    tourists visit annually attracted by Andorras dutyfree status and by its
    summer and winter resorts Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
    of arable land and most food has to be imported The principal livestock
    activity is sheep raising Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes
    cigars and furniture The rapid pace of European economic integration is a
    potential threat to Andorras advantages from its dutyfree status
