highlighted the virtues of Internet today and of the network that will
evolve from Internet  Listeners could discern in these narratives a
vision of an information democracy in which millions of citizens freely
find and use what they need  LYNCH noted that a lack of standards
inhibits disseminating multimedia on the network a topic also discussed
by BESSER  LARSEN addressed the issues of network scalability and
modularity and commented upon the difficulty of anticipating the effects
of growth in orders of magnitude  BROWNRIGG talked about the ability of
packet radio to provide certain links in a network without the need for
wiring  However the presenters also called attention to the
shortcomings and incongruities of presentday computer networks  For
example   Network use is growing dramatically but much network
traffic consists of personal communication Email   Large bodies of
information are available but a users ability to search across their
entirety is limited   There are significant resources for science and
technology but few network sources provide content in the humanities
 Machinereadable texts are commonplace but the capability of the
system to deal with images let alone other media formats lags behind
A glimpse of a multimedia future for networks however was provided by
Maria LEBRON in her overview of the Online Journal of Current Clinical
Trials OJCCT and the process of scholarly publishing online

The contrasting form of the CDROM disk was never systematically
analyzed but attendees could glean an impression from several of the
showandtell presentations  The Perseus and American Memory examples
demonstrated recently published disks while the descriptions of the
IBYCUS version of the Papers of George Washington and ChadwyckHealeys
Patrologia Latina Database PLD told of disks to come  According to
Eric CALALUCA PLDs principal focus has been on converting JacquesPaul
Mignes definitive collection of Latin texts to machinereadable form
Although everyone could share the network advocates enthusiasm for an
online future the possibility of rolling up ones sleeves for a session
with a CDROM containing both textual materials and a powerful retrieval
engine made the disk seem an appealing vessel indeed  The overall
discussion suggested that the transition from CDROM to online networked
access may prove far slower and more difficult than has been anticipated


WHO ARE THE USERS AND WHAT DO THEY DO?

Although concerned with the technicalities of production the Workshop
never lost sight of the purposes and uses of electronic versions of
textual materials  As noted above those interested in imaging discussed
the problematical matter of digital preservation while the TEI proponents
described how machinereadable texts can be used in research  This latter
topic received thorough treatment in the paper read by Avra MICHELSON
She placed the phenomenon of electronic texts within the context of
broader trends in information technology and scholarly communication

Among other things MICHELSON described online conferences that
represent a vigorous and important intellectual forum for certain
disciplines  Internet now carries more than  conferences with about
 percent of these devoted to topics in the social sciences and the
humanities  Other scholars use online networks for "distance learning"
Meanwhile there has been a tremendous growth in enduser computing
professors today are less likely than their predecessors to ask the
campus computer center to process their data  Electronic texts are one
key to these sophisticated applications MICHELSON reported and more and
more scholars in the humanities now work in an online environment
Toward the end of the Workshop Michael LESK presented a corollary to
MICHELSONs talk reporting the results of an experiment that compared
the work of one group of chemistry students using traditional printed
texts and two groups using electronic sources  The experiment
demonstrated that in the event one does not know what to read one needs
the electronic systems the electronic systems hold no advantage at the
moment if one knows what to read but neither do they impose a penalty

DALY provided an anecdotal account of the revolutionizing impact of the
new technology on his previous methods of research in the field of classics
His account by extrapolation served to illustrate in part the arguments
made by MICHELSON concerning the positive effects of the sudden and radical
transformation being wrought in the ways scholars work

Susan VECCIA and Joanne FREEMAN delineated the use of electronic
materials outside the university  The most interesting aspect of their
use FREEMAN said could be seen as a paradox  teachers in elementary
and secondary schools requested access to primary source materials but
at the same time found that "primariness" itself made these materials
difficult for their students to use


OTHER TOPICS

Marybeth PETERS reviewed copyright law in the United States and offered
advice during a lively discussion of this subject  But uncertainty
remains concerning the price of copyright in a digital medium because a
solution remains to be worked out concerning management and synthesis of
copyrighted and outofcopyright pieces of a database

As moderator of the final session of the Workshop Prosser GIFFORD directed
discussion to future courses of action and the potential role of LC in
advancing them  Among the recommendations that emerged were the following

      Workshop participants should  begin to think about working
     with image material but structure and digitize it in such a
     way that at a later stage it can be interpreted into text and
      find a common way to build text and images together so that
     they can be used jointly at some stage in the future with
     appropriate network support because that is how users will want
     to access these materials  The Library might encourage attempts
     to bring together people who are working on texts and images

      A network version of American Memory should be developed or
     consideration should be given to making the data in it
     available to people interested in doing network multimedia
     Given the current dearth of digital data that is appealing and
     unencumbered by extremely complex rights problems developing a
     network version of American Memory could do much to help make
     network multimedia a reality

      Concerning the thorny issue of electronic deposit LC should
     initiate a catalytic process in terms of distributed
     responsibility that is bring together the distributed
     organizations and set up a study group to look at all the
     issues related to electronic deposit and see where we as a
     nation should move  For example LC might attempt to persuade
     one major library in each state to deal with its state
     equivalent publisher which might produce a cooperative project
     that would be equitably distributed around the country and one
     in which LC would be dealing with a minimal number of publishers
     and minimal copyright problems  LC must also deal with the
     concept of online publishing determining among other things
     how serials such as OJCCT might be deposited for copyright

      Since a number of projects are planning to carry out
     preservation by creating digital images that will end up in
     online or nearline storage at some institution LC might play
     a helpful role at least in the near term by accelerating how
     to catalog that information into the Research Library Information
     Network RLIN and then into OCLC so that it would be accessible
     This would reduce the possibility of multiple institutions digitizing
     the same work


CONCLUSION

The Workshop was valuable because it brought together partisans from
various groups and provided an occasion to compare goals and methods
The more committed partisans frequently communicate with others in their
groups but less often across group boundaries  The Workshop was also
valuable to attendeesincluding those involved with American Memorywho
came less committed to particular approaches or concepts  These
attendees learned a great deal and plan to select and employ elements of
imaging textcoding and networked distribution that suit their
respective projects and purposes

Still reality rears its ugly head  no breakthrough has been achieved
On the imaging side one confronts a proliferation of competing
datainterchange standards and a lack of consensus on the role of digital
facsimiles in preservation  In the realm of machinereadable texts one
encounters a reasonably mature standard but methodological difficulties
and high costs  These latter problems of course represent a special
impediment to the desire as it is sometimes expressed in the popular
press "to put the contents of the Library of Congress on line"  In
the words of one participant there was "no solution to the economic
problemsthe projects that are out there are surviving but it is going
to be a lot of work to transform the information industry and so far the
investment to do that is not forthcoming" LESK per litteras

WELCOME


GIFFORD  Origin of Workshop in current Librarians desire to make LCs
collections more widely available  Desiderata arising from the prospect
of greater interconnectedness 


After welcoming participants on behalf of the Library of Congress
American Memory AM and the National Demonstration Lab Prosser
GIFFORD director for scholarly programs Library of Congress located
the origin of the Workshop on Electronic Texts in a conversation he had
had considerably more than a year ago with Carl FLEISCHHAUER concerning
some of the issues faced by AM  On the assumption that numerous other
people were asking the same questions the decision was made to bring
together as many of these people as possible to ask the same questions
together  In a deeper sense GIFFORD said the origin of the Workshop
lay in the desire of the current Librarian of Congress James H
Billington to make the collections of the Library especially those
offering unique or unusual testimony on aspects of the American
experience available to a much wider circle of users than those few
people who can come to Washington to use them  This meant that the
emphasis of AM from the outset has been on archival collections of the
basic material and on making these collections themselves available
rather than selected or heavily edited products

From AMs emphasis followed the questions with which the Workshop began
who will use these materials and in what form will they wish to use
them  But an even larger issue deserving mention in GIFFORDs view was
the phenomenal growth in Internet connectivity  He expressed the hope
that the prospect of greater interconnectedness than ever before would
lead to   much more cooperative and mutually supportive endeavors 
development of systems of shared and distributed responsibilities to
avoid duplication and to ensure accuracy and preservation of unique
materials and  agreement on the necessary standards and development of
the appropriate directories and indices to make navigation
straightforward among the varied resources that are and increasingly
will be available  In this connection GIFFORD requested that
participants reflect from the outset upon the sorts of outcomes they
thought the Workshop might have  Did those present constitute a group
with sufficient common interests to propose a next step or next steps
and if so what might those be?  They would return to these questions the
following afternoon

                                 


FLEISCHHAUER  Core of Workshop concerns preparation and production of
materials  Special challenge in conversion of textual materials 
Quality versus quantity  Do the several groups represented share common
interests? 


Carl FLEISCHHAUER coordinator American Memory Library of Congress
emphasized that he would attempt to represent the people who perform some
of the work of converting or preparing  materials and that the core of
the Workshop had to do with preparation and production  FLEISCHHAUER
then drew a distinction between the long term when many things would be
available and connected in the ways that GIFFORD described and the short
term in which AM not only has wrestled with the issue of what is the
best course to pursue but also has faced a variety of technical
challenges

FLEISCHHAUER remarked AMs endeavors to deal with a wide range of library
formats such as motion picture collections soundrecording collections
and pictorial collections of various sorts especially collections of
photographs  In the course of these efforts AM kept coming back to
textual materialsmanuscripts or rare printed matter bound materials
etc  Text posed the greatest conversion challenge of all  Thus the
genesis of the Workshop which reflects the problems faced by AM  These
problems include physical problems  For example those in the library
and archive business deal with collections made up of fragile and rare
manuscript items bound materials especially the notoriously brittle
bound materials of the late nineteenth century  These are precious
cultural artifacts however as well as interesting sources of
information and LC desires to retain and conserve them  AM needs to
handle things without damaging them  Guillotining a book to run it
through a sheet feeder must be avoided at all costs

Beyond physical problems issues pertaining to quality arose  For
example the desire to provide users with a searchable text is affected
by the question of acceptable level of accuracy  One hundred percent
accuracy is tremendously expensive  On the other hand the output of
optical character recognition OCR can be tremendously inaccurate
Although AM has attempted to find a middle ground uncertainty persists
as to whether or not it has discovered the right solution

Questions of quality arose concerning images as well  FLEISCHHAUER
contrasted the extremely high level of quality of the digital images in
the Cornell Xerox Project with AMs efforts to provide a browsequality
or accessquality image as opposed to an archival or preservation image
FLEISCHHAUER therefore welcomed the opportunity to compare notes

FLEISCHHAUER observed in passing that conversations he had had about
networks have begun to signal that for various forms of media a
determination may be made that there is a browsequality item or a
distributionandaccessquality item that may coexist in some systems
with a higher quality archival item that would be inconvenient to send
through the network because of its size  FLEISCHHAUER referred of
course to images more than to searchable text

As AM considered those questions several conceptual issues arose  ought
AM occasionally to reproduce materials entirely through an image set at
other times entirely through a text set and in some cases a mix?
There probably would be times when the historical authenticity of an
artifact would require that its image be used  An image might be
desirable as a recourse for users if one could not provide percent
accurate text  Again AM wondered as a practical matter if a
distinction could be drawn between rare printed matter that might exist
in multiple collectionsthat is in ten or fifteen libraries  In such
cases the need for perfect reproduction would be less than for unique
items  Implicit in his remarks FLEISCHHAUER conceded was the admission
that AM has been tilting strongly towards quantity and drawing back a
little from perfect quality  That is it seemed to AM that society would
be better served if more things were distributed by LCeven if they were
not quite perfectthan if fewer things perfectly represented were
distributed  This was stated as a proposition to be tested with
responses to be gathered from users

In thinking about issues related to reproduction of materials and seeing
other people engaged in parallel activities AM deemed it useful to
convene a conference  Hence the Workshop  FLEISCHHAUER thereupon
surveyed the several groups represented   the world of images image
users and image makers  the world of text and scholarship and within
this group those concerned with languageFLEISCHHAUER confessed to finding
delightful irony in the fact that some of the most advanced thinkers on
computerized texts are those dealing with ancient Greek and Roman materials
 the network world and  the general world of library science which
includes people interested in preservation and cataloging

FLEISCHHAUER concluded his remarks with special thanks to the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation for its support of the meeting the American
Memory group the Office for Scholarly Programs the National
Demonstration Lab and the Office of Special Events  He expressed the
hope that David Woodley Packard might be able to attend noting that
Packards work and the work of the foundation had sponsored a number of
projects in the text area

                                 

SESSION I  CONTENT IN A NEW FORM   WHO WILL USE IT AND WHAT WILL THEY DO?


DALY  Acknowledgements  A new Latin authors disk   Effects of the new
technology on previous methods of research 


Serving as moderator James DALY acknowledged the generosity of all the
presenters for giving of their time counsel and patience in planning
the Workshop as well as of members of the American Memory project and
other Library of Congress staff and the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation and its executive director Colburn S Wilbur

DALY then recounted his visit in March to the Center for Electronic Texts
in the Humanities CETH and the Department of Classics at Rutgers
University where an old friend Lowell Edmunds introduced him to the
departments IBYCUS scholarly personal computer and in particular the
new Latin CDROM containing among other things almost all classical
Latin literary texts through AD   Packard Humanities Institute
PHI Los Altos California released this disk late in  with a
nominal triennial licensing fee

Playing with the disk for an hour or so at Rutgers brought home to DALY
at once the revolutionizing impact of the new technology on his previous
methods of research  Had this disk been available two or three years
earlier DALY contended when he was engaged in preparing a commentary on
Book  of Virgils Aeneid for Cambridge University Press he would not
have required a fortyeightsquarefoot table on which to spread the
numerous most frequently consulted items including some ten or twelve
concordances to key Latin authors an almost equal number of lexica to
authors who lacked concordances and where either lexica or concordances
were lacking numerous editions of authors antedating and postdating Virgil

Nor when checking each of the average six to seven words contained in
the Virgilian hexameter for its usage elsewhere in Virgils works or
other Latin authors would DALY have had to maintain the laborious
mechanical process of flipping through these concordances lexica and
editions each time  Nor would he have had to frequent as often the
Milton S Eisenhower Library at the Johns Hopkins University to consult
the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae  Instead of devoting countless hours or
the bulk of his research time to gathering data concerning Virgils use
of words DALYnow freed by PHIs Latin authors disk from the
tyrannical yet in some ways paradoxically happy scholarly drudgery
would have been able to devote that same bulk of time to analyzing and
interpreting Virgilian verbal usage

Citing Theodore Brunner Gregory Crane Elli MYLONAS and Avra MICHELSON
DALY argued that this reversal in his style of work made possible by the
new technology would perhaps have resulted in better more productive
research  Indeed even in the course of his browsing the Latin authors
disk at Rutgers its powerful search retrieval and highlighting
capabilities suggested to him several new avenues of research into
Virgils use of sound effects  This anecdotal account DALY maintained
may serve to illustrate in part the sudden and radical transformation
being wrought in the ways scholars work

                                 


MICHELSON  Elements related to scholarship and technology  Electronic
texts within the context of broader trends within information technology
and scholarly communication  Evaluation of the prospects for the use of
electronic texts  Relationship of electronic texts to processes of
scholarly communication in humanities research  New exchange formats
created by scholars  Projects initiated to increase scholarly access to
converted text  Trend toward making electronic resources available
through research and education networks  Changes taking place in
scholarly communication among humanities scholars  Networkmediated
scholarship transforming traditional scholarly practices  Key
information technology trends affecting the conduct of scholarly
communication over the next decade  The trend toward enduser computing
 The trend toward greater connectivity  Effects of these trends  Key
transformations taking place  Summary of principal arguments 


Avra MICHELSON Archival Research and Evaluation Staff National Archives
and Records Administration NARA argued that establishing who will use
electronic texts and what they will use them for involves a consideration
of both information technology and scholarship trends  This
consideration includes several elements related to scholarship and
technology   the key trends in information technology that are most
relevant to scholarship  the key trends in the use of currently
available technology by scholars in the nonscientific community and 
the relationship between these two very distinct but interrelated trends
The investment in understanding this relationship being made by
information providers technologists and public policy developers as
well as by scholars themselves seems to be pervasive and growing
MICHELSON contended  She drew on collaborative work with Jeff Rothenberg
on the scholarly use of technology

MICHELSON sought to place the phenomenon of electronic texts within the
context of broader trends within information technology and scholarly
communication  She argued that electronic texts are of most use to
researchers to the extent that the researchers working context ie
their relevant bibliographic sources collegial feedback analytic tools
notes drafts etc along with their fields primary and secondary
sources also is accessible in electronic form and can be integrated in
ways that are unique to the online environment

Evaluation of the prospects for the use of electronic texts includes two
elements   an examination of the ways in which researchers currently
are using electronic texts along with other electronic resources and 
an analysis of key information technology trends that are affecting the
longterm conduct of scholarly communication  MICHELSON limited her
discussion of the use of electronic texts to the practices of humanists
and noted that the scientific community was outside the panels overview

MICHELSON examined the nature of the current relationship of electronic
texts in particular and electronic resources in general to what she
maintained were essentially five processes of scholarly communication
in humanities research  Researchers  identify sources  communicate
with their colleagues  interpret and analyze data  disseminate
their research findings and  prepare curricula to instruct the next
generation of scholars and students  This examination would produce a
clearer understanding of the synergy among these five processes that
fuels the tendency of the use of electronic resources for one process to
stimulate its use for other processes of scholarly communication

For the first process of scholarly communication the identification of
sources MICHELSON remarked the opportunity scholars now enjoy to
supplement traditional wordofmouth searches for sources among their
colleagues with new forms of electronic searching  So for example
instead of having to visit the library researchers are able to explore
descriptions of holdings in their offices  Furthermore if their own
institutions holdings prove insufficient scholars can access more than
 major American library catalogues over Internet including the
universities of California Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
Direct access to the bibliographic databases offers intellectual
empowerment to scholars by presenting a comprehensive means of browsing
through libraries from their homes and offices at their convenience

The second process of communication involves communication among
scholars  Beyond the most common methods of communication scholars are
using Email and a variety of new electronic communications formats
derived from it for further academic interchange  Email exchanges are
growing at an astonishing rate reportedly  percent a month  They
currently constitute approximately half the traffic on research and
education networks  Moreover the global spread of Email has been so
rapid that it is now possible for American scholars to use it to
communicate with colleagues in close to  other countries

Other new exchange formats created by scholars and operating on Internet
include more than  conferences with about  percent of these devoted
to topics in the social sciences and humanities  The rate of growth of
these scholarly electronic conferences also is astonishing  From l to
l  new conferences were identified on Internet  From October 
to June  an additional  conferences in the social sciences and
humanities were added to this directory of listings  Scholars have
established conferences in virtually every field within every different
discipline  For example there are currently close to  active social
science and humanities  conferences on topics such as art and
architecture ethnomusicology folklore Japanese culture medical
education and gifted and talented education  The appeal to scholars of
communicating through these conferences is that unlike any other medium
electronic conferences today provide a forum for global communication
with peers at the front end of the research process

Interpretation and analysis of sources constitutes the third process of
scholarly communication that MICHELSON discussed in terms of texts and
textual resources  The methods used to analyze sources fall somewhere on
a continuum from quantitative analysis to qualitative analysis
Typically evidence is culled and evaluated using methods drawn from both
ends of this continuum  At one end quantitative analysis involves the
use of mathematical processes such as a count of frequencies and
distributions of occurrences or on a higher level regression analysis
At the other end of the continuum qualitative analysis typically
involves nonmathematical processes oriented toward language
interpretation or the building of theory  Aspects of this work involve
the processingeither manual or computationalof large and sometimes
massive amounts of textual sources although the use of nontextual
sources as evidence such as photographs sound recordings film footage
and artifacts is significant as well

Scholars have discovered that many of the methods of interpretation and
analysis that are related to both quantitative and qualitative methods
are processes that can be performed by computers  For example computers
can count  They can count brush strokes used in a Rembrandt painting or
perform regression analysis for understanding cause and effect  By means
of advanced technologies computers can recognize patterns analyze text
and model concepts  Furthermore computers can complete these processes
faster with more sources and with greater precision than scholars who
must rely on manual interpretation of data  But if scholars are to use
computers for these processes source materials must be in a form
amenable to computerassisted analysis  For this reason many scholars
once they have identified the sources that are key to their research are
converting them to machinereadable form  Thus a representative example
of the numerous textual conversion projects organized by scholars around
the world in recent years to support computational text analysis is the
TLG the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae  This project is devoted to
converting the extant ancient texts of classical Greece  Editors note
according to the TLG Newsletter of May l TLG was in use in thirtytwo
different countries  This figure updates MICHELSONs previous count by one

The scholars performing these conversions have been asked to recognize
that the electronic sources they are converting for one use possess value
for other research purposes as well  As a result during the past few
years humanities scholars have initiated a number of projects to
increase scholarly access to converted text  So for example the Text
Encoding Initiative TEI about which more is said later in the program
was established as an effort by scholars to determine standard elements
and methods for encoding machinereadable text for electronic exchange
In a second effort to facilitate the sharing of converted text scholars
have created a new institution the Center for Electronic Texts in the
Humanities CETH  The center estimates that there are  series of
source texts in the humanities that have been converted to
machinereadable form worldwide  CETH is undertaking an international
search for converted text in the humanities compiling it into an
electronic library and preparing bibliographic descriptions of the
sources for the Research Libraries Information Networks RLIN
machinereadable data file  The library profession has begun to initiate
large conversion projects as well such as American Memory

While scholars have been making converted text available to one another
typically on disk or on CDROM the clear trend is toward making these
resources available through research and education networks  Thus the
American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language
ARTFL and the Dante Project are already available on Internet
MICHELSON summarized this section on interpretation and analysis by
noting that   increasing numbers of humanities scholars in the library
community are recognizing the importance to the advancement of
scholarship of retrospective conversion of source materials in the arts
and humanities and  there is a growing realization that making the
sources available on research and education networks maximizes their
usefulness for the analysis performed by humanities scholars

The fourth process of scholarly communication is dissemination of
research findings that is publication  Scholars are using existing
research and education networks to engineer a new type of publication
scholarlycontrolled journals that are electronically produced and
disseminated  Although such journals are still emerging as a
communication format their number has grown from approximately twelve
to thirtysix during the past year July  to June   Most of
these electronic scholarly journals are devoted to topics in the
humanities  As with network conferences scholarly enthusiasm for these
electronic journals stems from the mediums unique ability to advance
scholarship in a way that no other medium can do by supporting global
feedback and interchange practically in real time early in the research
process  Beyond scholarly journals MICHELSON remarked the delivery of
commercial fulltext products such as articles in professional journals
newsletters magazines wire services and reference sources  These are
being delivered via online local library catalogues especially through
CDROMs  Furthermore according to MICHELSON there is general optimism
that the copyright and fees issues impeding the delivery of full text on
existing research and education networks soon will be resolved

The final process of scholarly communication is curriculum development
and instruction and this involves the use of computer information
technologies in two areas  The first is the development of
computeroriented instructional tools which includes simulations
multimedia applications and computer tools that are used to assist in
the analysis of sources in the classroom etc  The Perseus Project a
database that provides a multimedia curriculum on classical Greek
civilization is a good example of the way in which entire curricula are
being recast using information technologies  It is anticipated that the
current difficulty in exchanging electronically computerbased
instructional software which in turn makes it difficult for one scholar
to build upon the work of others will be resolved before too long
Standalone curricular applications that involve electronic text will be
sharable through networks reinforcing their significance as intellectual
products as well as instructional tools

The second aspect of electronic learning involves the use of research and
education networks for distance education programs  Such programs
interactively link teachers with students in geographically scattered
locations and rely on the availability of electronic instructional
resources  Distance education programs are gaining wide appeal among
state departments of education because of their demonstrated capacity to
bring advanced specialized course work and an array of experts to many
classrooms  A recent report found that at least  states operated at
least one statewide network for education in  with networks under
development in many of the remaining states

MICHELSON summarized this section by noting two striking changes taking
place in scholarly communication among humanities scholars  First is the
extent to which electronic text in particular and electronic resources
in general are being infused into each of the five processes described
above  As mentioned earlier there is a certain synergy at work here
The use of electronic resources for one process tends to stimulate its
use for other processes because the chief course of movement is toward a
comprehensive online working context for humanities scholars that
includes online availability of key bibliographies scholarly feedback
sources analytical tools and publications  MICHELSON noted further
that the movement toward a comprehensive online working context for
humanities scholars is not new  In fact it has been underway for more
than forty years in the humanities since Father Roberto Busa began
developing an electronic concordance of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas
in   What we are witnessing today MICHELSON contended is not the
beginning of this online transition but for at least some humanities
scholars the turning point in the transition from a print to an
electronic working context  Coinciding with the online transition the
second striking change is the extent to which research and education
networks are becoming the new medium of scholarly communication  The
existing Internet and the pending National Education and Research Network
NREN represent the new meeting ground where scholars are going for
bibliographic information scholarly dialogue and feedback the most
current publications in their field and highlevel educational
offerings  Traditional scholarly practices are undergoing tremendous
transformations as a result of the emergence and growing prominence of
what is called networkmediated scholarship

MICHELSON next turned to the second element of the framework she proposed
at the outset of her talk for evaluating the prospects for electronic
text namely the key information technology trends affecting the conduct
of scholarly communication over the next decade   enduser computing
and  connectivity

Enduser computing means that the person touching the keyboard or
performing computations is the same as the person who initiates or
consumes the computation  The emergence of personal computers along
with a host of other forces such as ubiquitous computing advances in
interface design and the online transition is prompting the consumers
of computation to do their own computing and is thus rendering obsolete
the traditional distinction between end users and ultimate users

The trend toward enduser computing is significant to consideration of
the prospects for electronic texts because it means that researchers are
becoming more adept at doing their own computations and thus more
competent in the use of electronic media  By avoiding programmer
intermediaries computation is becoming central to the researchers
thought process  This direct involvement in computing is changing the
researchers perspective on the nature of research itself that is the
kinds of questions that can be posed the analytical methodologies that
can be used the types and amount of sources that are appropriate for
analyses and the form in which findings are presented  The trend toward
enduser computing means that increasingly electronic media and
computation are being infused into all processes of humanities
scholarship inspiring remarkable transformations in scholarly
communication

The trend toward greater connectivity suggests that researchers are using
computation increasingly in network environments  Connectivity is
important to scholarship because it erases the distance that separates
students from teachers and scholars from their colleagues while allowing
users to access remote databases share information in many different
media connect to their working context wherever they are and
collaborate in all phases of research

The combination of the trend toward enduser computing and the trend
toward connectivity suggests that the scholarly use of electronic
resources already evident among some researchers will soon become an
established feature of scholarship  The effects of these trends along
with ongoing changes in scholarly practices point to a future in which
humanities researchers will use computation and electronic communication
to help them formulate ideas access sources perform research
collaborate with colleagues seek peer review publish and disseminate
results and engage in many other professional and educational activities

In summary MICHELSON emphasized four points   A portion of humanities
scholars already consider electronic texts the preferred format for
analysis and dissemination   Scholars are using these electronic
texts in conjunction with other electronic resources in all the
processes of scholarly communication   The humanities scholars
working context is in the process of changing from print technology to
electronic technology in many ways mirroring transformations that have
occurred or are occurring within the scientific community   These
changes are occurring in conjunction with the development of a new
communication medium  research and education networks that are
characterized by their capacity to advance scholarship in a wholly unique
way

MICHELSON also reiterated her three principal arguments  l Electronic
texts are best understood in terms of the relationship to other
electronic resources and the growing prominence of networkmediated
scholarship   The prospects for electronic texts lie in their capacity
to be integrated into the online network of electronic resources that
comprise the new working context for scholars   Retrospective conversion
of portions of the scholarly record should be a key strategy as information
providers respond to changes in scholarly communication practices

implement that project  FREEMAN has been an associate coordinator of AM
and has been involved principally with the interpretative materials
preparing some of the electronic exhibits and printed historical
information that accompanies AM and that is requested by users  VECCIA
and FREEMAN shared anecdotal observations concerning AM with public users
of electronic resources  Notwithstanding a fairly structured evaluation
in progress both VECCIA and FREEMAN chose not to report on specifics in
terms of numbers etc because they felt it was too early in the
evaluation project to do so

AM is an electronic archive of primary source materials from the Library
of Congress selected collections representing a variety of formats
photographs graphic arts recorded sound motion pictures broadsides
and soon pamphlets and books  In terms of the design of this system
the interpretative exhibits have been kept separate from the primary
resources with good reason  Accompanying this collection are printed
documentation and user guides as well as guides that FREEMAN prepared for
teachers so that they may begin using the content of the system at once

VECCIA described the evaluation project before talking about the public
users of AM limiting her remarks to public libraries because FREEMAN
would talk more specifically about schools from kindergarten to twelfth
grade K   Having started in spring  the evaluation currently
involves testing of the Macintosh implementation of AM  Since the
primary goal of this evaluation is to determine the most appropriate
audience or audiences for AM very different sites were selected  This
makes evaluation difficult because of the varying degrees of technology
literacy among the sites  AM is situated in fortyfour locations of
which six are public libraries and sixteen are schools  Represented
among the schools are elementary junior high and high schools
District offices also are involved in the evaluation which will
conclude in summer 

VECCIA focused the remainder of her talk on the six public libraries one
of which doubles as a state library  They represent a range of
geographic areas and a range of demographic characteristics  For
example three are located in urban settings two in rural settings and
one in a suburban setting  A range of technical expertise is to be found
among these facilities as well  For example one is an "Apple library of
the future" while two others are rural oneroom librariesin one AM
sits at the front desk next to a tractor manual

All public libraries have been extremely enthusiastic supportive and
appreciative of the work that AM has been doing  VECCIA characterized
various users  Most users in public libraries describe themselves as
general readers of the students who use AM in the public libraries
those in fourth grade and above seem most interested  Public libraries
in rural sites tend to attract retired people who have been highly
receptive to AM  Users tend to fall into two additional categories
people interested in the content and historical connotations of these
primary resources and those fascinated by the technology  The format
receiving the most comments has been motion pictures  The adult users in
public libraries are more comfortable with IBM computers whereas young
people seem comfortable with either IBM or Macintosh although most of
them seem to come from a Macintosh background  This same tendency is
found in the schools

What kinds of things do users do with AM?  In a public library there are
two main goals or ways that AM is being used  as an individual learning
tool and as a leisure activity  Adult learning was one area that VECCIA
would highlight as a possible application for a tool such as AM  She
described a patron of a rural public library who comes in every day on
his lunch hour and literally reads AM methodically going through the
collection image by image  At the end of his hour he makes an electronic
bookmark puts it in his pocket and returns to work  The next day he
comes in and resumes where he left off  Interestingly this man had
never been in the library before he used AM  In another small rural
library the coordinator reports that AM is a popular activity for some
of the older retired people in the community who ordinarily would not
use "those things"computers  Another example of adult learning in
public libraries is book groups one of which in particular is using AM
as part of its reading on industrialization integration and urbanization
in the early s

One library reports that a family is using AM to help educate their
children  In another instance individuals from a local museum came in
to use AM to prepare an exhibit on toys of the past  These two examples
emphasize the mission of the public library as a cultural institution
reaching out to people who do not have the same resources available to
those who live in a metropolitan area or have access to a major library
One rural library reports that junior high school students in large
numbers came in one afternoon to use AM for entertainment  A number of
public libraries reported great interest among postcard collectors in the
Detroit collection which was essentially a collection of images used on
postcards around the turn of the century  Train buffs are similarly
interested because that was a time of great interest in railroading
People it was found relate to things that they know of firsthand  For
example in both rural public libraries where AM was made available
observers reported that the older people with personal remembrances of
the turn of the century were gravitating to the Detroit collection
These examples served to underscore MICHELSONs observation re the
integration of electronic tools and ideasthat people learn best when
the material relates to something they know

VECCIA made the final point that in many cases AM serves as a
publicrelations tool for the public libraries that are testing it  In
one case AM is being used as a vehicle to secure additional funding for
the library  In another case AM has served as an inspiration to the
staff of a major local public library in the South to think about ways to
make its own collection of photographs more accessible to the public

                                  


FREEMAN  AM and archival electronic resources in a school environment 
Questions concerning context  Questions concerning the electronic format
itself  Computer anxiety  Access and availability of the system 
Hardware  Strengths gained through the use of archival resources in
schools 


Reiterating an observation made by VECCIA that AM is an archival
resource made up of primary materials with very little interpretation
FREEMAN stated that the project has attempted to bridge the gap between
these bare primary materials and a school environment and in that cause
has created guided introductions to AM collections  Loud demand from the
educational community  chiefly from teachers working with the upper
grades of elementary school through high school greeted the announcement
that AM would be tested around the country

FREEMAN reported not only on what was learned about AM in a school
environment but also on several universal questions that were raised
concerning archival electronic resources in schools  She discussed
several strengths of this type of material in a school environment as
opposed to a highly structured resource that offers a limited number of
paths to follow

FREEMAN first raised several questions about using AM in a school
environment  There is often some difficulty in developing a sense of
what the system contains  Many students sit down at a computer resource
and assume that because AM comes from the Library of Congress all of
American history is now at their fingertips  As a result of that sort of
mistaken judgment some students are known to conclude that AM contains
nothing of use to them when they look for one or two things and do not
find them  It is difficult to discover that middle ground where one has
a sense of what the system contains  Some students grope toward the idea
of an archive a new idea to them since they have not previously
experienced what it means to have access to a vast body of somewhat
random information

Other questions raised by FREEMAN concerned the electronic format itself
For instance in a school environment it is often difficult both for
teachers and students to gain a sense of what it is they are viewing
They understand that it is a visual image but they do not necessarily
know that it is a postcard from the turn of the century a panoramic
photograph or even machinereadable text of an eighteenthcentury
broadside a twentiethcentury printed book or a nineteenthcentury
diary  That distinction is often difficult for people in a school
environment to grasp  Because of that it occasionally becomes difficult
to draw conclusions from what one is viewing

FREEMAN also noted the obvious fear of the computer which constitutes a
difficulty in using an electronic resource  Though students in general
did not suffer from this anxiety several older students feared that they
were computerilliterate an assumption that became selffulfilling when
they searched for something but failed to find it  FREEMAN said she
believed that some teachers also fear computer resources because they
believe they lack complete control  FREEMAN related the example of
teachers shooing away students because it was not their time to use the
system  This was a case in which the situation had to be extremely
structured so that the teachers would not feel that they had lost their
grasp on what the system contained

A final question raised by FREEMAN concerned access and availability of
the system  She noted the occasional existence of a gap in communication
between school librarians and teachers  Often AM sits in a school
library and the librarian is the person responsible for monitoring the
system  Teachers do not always take into their world new library
resources about which the librarian is excited  Indeed at the sites
where AM had been used most effectively within a library the librarian
was required to go to specific teachers and instruct them in its use  As
a result several AM sites will have inservice sessions over a summer
in the hope that perhaps with a more individualized link teachers will
be more likely to use the resource

A related issue in the school context concerned the number of
workstations available at any one location  Centralization of equipment
at the district level with teachers invited to download things and walk
away with them proved unsuccessful because the hours these offices were
open were also school hours

Another issue was hardware  As VECCIA observed a range of sites exists
some technologically advanced and others essentially acquiring their
first computer for the primary purpose of using it in conjunction with
AMs testing  Users at technologically sophisticated sites want even
more sophisticated hardware so that they can perform even more
sophisticated tasks with the materials in AM  But once they acquire a
newer piece of hardware they must learn how to use that also at an
unsophisticated site it takes an extremely long time simply to become
accustomed to the computer not to mention the program offered with the
computer  All of these small issues raise one large question namely
are systems like AM truly rewarding in a school environment or do they
simply act as innovative toys that do little more than spark interest?

FREEMAN contended that the evaluation project has revealed several strengths
that were gained through the use of archival resources in schools including

      Psychic rewards from using AM as a vast rich database with
     teachers assigning various projects to studentsoral presentations
     written reports a documentary a turnofthecentury newspaper
     projects that start with the materials in AM but are completed using
     other resources AM thus is used as a research tool in conjunction
     with other electronic resources as well as with books and items in
     the library where the system is set up

      Students are acquiring computer literacy in a humanities context

      This sort of system is overcoming the isolation between disciplines
     that often exists in schools  For example many English teachers are
     requiring their students to write papers on historical topics
     represented in AM  Numerous teachers have reported that their
     students are learning critical thinking skills using the system

      On a broader level AM is introducing primary materials not only
     to students but also to teachers in an environment where often
     simply none existan exciting thing for the students because it
     helps them learn to conduct research to interpret and to draw
     their own conclusions  In learning to conduct research and what it
     means students are motivated to seek knowledge  That relates to
     another positive outcomea high level of personal involvement of
     students with the materials in this system and greater motivation to
     conduct their own research and draw their own conclusions

      Perhaps the most ironic strength of these kinds of archival
     electronic resources is that many of the teachers AM interviewed
     were desperate it is no exaggeration to say not only for primary
     materials but for unstructured primary materials  These would they
     thought foster personally motivated research exploration and
     excitement in their students  Indeed these materials have done
     just that  Ironically however this lack of structure produces
     some of the confusion to which the newness of these kinds of
     resources may also contribute  The key to effective use of archival
     products in a school environment is a clear effective introduction
     to the system and to what it contains

                                 


DISCUSSION  Nothing known quantitatively about the number of
humanities scholars who must see the original versus those who would
settle for an edited transcript or about the ways in which humanities
scholars are using information technology  Firm conclusions concerning
the manner and extent of the use of supporting materials in print
provided by AM to await completion of evaluative study  A listeners
reflections on additional applications of electronic texts  Role of
electronic resources in teaching elementary research skills to students 


During the discussion that followed the presentations by MICHELSON
VECCIA and FREEMAN additional points emerged

LESK asked if MICHELSON could give any quantitative estimate of the
number of humanities scholars who must see or want to see the original
or the best possible version of the material versus those who typically
would settle for an edited transcript  While unable to provide a figure
she offered her impressions as an archivist who has done some reference
work and has discussed this issue with other archivists who perform
reference that those who use archives and those who use primary sources
for what would be considered very highlevel scholarly research as
opposed to say undergraduate papers were few in number especially
given the public interest in using primary sources to conduct
genealogical or avocational research and the kind of professional
research done by people in private industry or the federal government
More important in MICHELSONs view was that quantitatively nothing is
known about the ways in which for example humanities scholars are using
information technology  No studies exist to offer guidance in creating
strategies  The most recent study was conducted in  by the American
Council of Learned Societies ACLS and what it showed was that 
percent of humanities scholars at that time were using computers  That
constitutes the extent of our knowledge

Concerning AMs strategy for orienting people toward the scope of
electronic resources FREEMAN could offer no hard conclusions at this
point because she and her colleagues were still waiting to see
particularly in the schools what has been made of their efforts  Within
the system however AM has provided what are called electronic exhibits
such as introductions to time periods and materialsand these are
intended to offer a student user a sense of what a broadside is  and what
it might tell her or him  But FREEMAN conceded that the project staff
would have to talk with students next year after teachers have had a
summer to use the materials and attempt to discover what the students
were learning from the materials  In addition FREEMAN described
supporting materials in print provided by AM at the request of local
teachers during a meeting held at LC  These included time lines
bibliographies and other materials that could be reproduced on a
photocopier in a classroom  Teachers could walk away with and use these
and in this way gain a better understanding of the contents  But again
reaching firm conclusions concerning the manner and extent of their use
would have to wait until next year

As to the changes she saw occurring at the National Archives and Records
Administration NARA as a result of the increasing emphasis on
technology in scholarly research MICHELSON stated that NARA at this
point was absorbing the report by her and Jeff Rothenberg addressing
strategies for the archival profession in general although not for the
National Archives specifically  NARA is just beginning to establish its
role and what it can do  In terms of changes and initiatives that NARA
can take no clear response could be given at this time

GREENFIELD remarked two trends mentioned in the session  Reflecting on
DALYs opening comments on how he could have used a Latin collection of
text in an electronic form he said that at first he thought most scholars
would be unwilling to do that  But as he thought of that in terms of the
original meaning of researchthat is having already mastered these texts
researching them for critical and comparative purposesfor the first time
the electronic format made a lot of sense  GREENFIELD could envision
growing numbers of scholars learning the new technologies for that very
aspect of their scholarship and for conveniences sake

Listening to VECCIA and FREEMAN GREENFIELD thought of an additional
application of electronic texts  He realized that AM could be used as a
guide to lead someone to original sources  Students cannot be expected
to have mastered these sources things they have never known about
before  Thus AM is leading them in theory to a vast body of
information and giving them a superficial overview of it enabling them
to select parts of it  GREENFIELD asked if any evidence exists that this
resource will indeed teach the new user the K students how to do
research  Scholars already know how to do research and are applying
these new tools  But he wondered why students would go beyond picking
out things that were most exciting to them

FREEMAN conceded the correctness of GREENFIELDs observation as applied
to a school environment  The risk is that a student would sit down at a
system play with it find some things of interest and then walk away
But in the relatively controlled situation of a school library much will
depend on the instructions a teacher or a librarian gives a student  She
viewed the situation not as one of finetuning research skills but of
involving students at a personal level in understanding and researching
things  Given the guidance one can receive at school it then becomes
possible to teach elementary research skills to students which in fact
one particular librarian said she was teaching her fifth graders
FREEMAN concluded that introducing the idea of following ones own path
of inquiry which is essentially what research entails involves more
than teaching specific skills  To these comments VECCIA added the
observation that the individual teacher and the use of a creative
resource rather than AM itself seemed to make the key difference
Some schools and some teachers are making excellent use of the nature
of critical thinking and teaching skills she said

Concurring with these remarks DALY closed the session with the thought that
the more that producers produced for teachers and for scholars to use with
their students the more successful their electronic products would prove

                                 

SESSION II  SHOW AND TELL

Jacqueline HESS director National Demonstration Laboratory served as
moderator of the "showandtell" session  She noted that a
questionandanswer period would follow each presentation


MYLONAS  Overview and content of Perseus  Perseus primary materials
exist in a systemindependent archival form  A concession  Textual
aspects of Perseus  Tools to use with the Greek text  Prepared indices
and fulltext searches in Perseus  EnglishGreek word search leads to
close study of words and concepts  Navigating Perseus by tracing down
indices  Using the iconography to perform research 


Elli MYLONAS managing editor Perseus Project Harvard University first
gave an overview of Perseus a large collaborative effort based at
Harvard University but with contributors and collaborators located at
numerous universities and colleges in the United States eg Bowdoin
Maryland Pomona Chicago Virginia  Funded primarily by the
AnnenbergCPB Project with additional funding from Apple Harvard and
the Packard Humanities Institute among others Perseus is a multimedia
hypertextual database for teaching and research on classical Greek
civilization which was released in February  in version  and
distributed by Yale University Press

Consisting entirely of primary materials Perseus includes ancient Greek
texts and translations of those texts catalog entriesthat is museum
catalog entries not library catalog entrieson vases sites coins
sculpture and archaeological objects maps and a dictionary among
other sources  The number of objects and the objects for which catalog
entries exist are accompanied by thousands of color images which
constitute a major feature of the database  Perseus contains
approximately  megabytes of text an amount that will double in
subsequent versions  In addition to these primary materials the Perseus
Project has been building tools for using them making access and
navigation easier the goal being to build part of the electronic
environment discussed earlier in the morning in which students or
scholars can work with their sources

The demonstration of Perseus will show only a fraction of the real work
that has gone into it because the project had to face the dilemma of
what to enter when putting something into machinereadable form  should
one aim for very high quality or make concessions in order to get the
material in?  Since Perseus decided to opt for very high quality all of
its primary materials exist in a systemindependentinsofar as it is
possible to be systemindependentarchival form  Deciding what that
archival form would be and attaining it required much work and thought
For example all the texts are marked up in SGML which will be made
compatible with the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative TEI when
they are issued

Drawings are postscript files not meeting international standards but
at least designed to go across platforms  Images or rather the real
archival forms consist of the best available slides which are being
digitized  Much of the catalog material exists in database forma form
that the average user could use manipulate and display on a personal
computer but only at great cost  Thus this is where the concession
comes in  All of this rich wellmarkedup information is stripped of
much of its content the images are converted into bitmaps and the text
into small formatted chunks  All this information can then be imported
into HyperCard and run on a midrange Macintosh which is what Perseus
users have  This fact has made it possible for Perseus to attain wide
use fairly rapidly  Without those archival forms the HyperCard version
being demonstrated could not be made easily and the project could not
have the potential to move to other forms and machines and software as
they appear none of which information is in Perseus on the CD

Of the numerous multimedia aspects of Perseus MYLONAS focused on the
textual  Part of what makes Perseus such a pleasure to use MYLONAS
said is this effort at seamless integration and the ability to move
around both visual and textual material  Perseus also made the decision
not to attempt to interpret its material any more than one interprets by
selecting  But MYLONAS emphasized Perseus is not courseware  No
syllabus exists  There is no effort to define how one teaches a topic
using Perseus although the project may eventually collect papers by
people who have used it to teach  Rather Perseus aims to provide
primary material in a kind of electronic library an electronic sandbox
so to say in which students and scholars who are working on this
material can explore by themselves  With that MYLONAS demonstrated
Perseus beginning with the Perseus gateway the first thing one sees
upon opening Perseusan effort in part to solve the contextualizing
problemwhich tells the user what the system contains

MYLONAS demonstrated only a very small portion beginning with primary
texts and running off the CDROM  Having selected Aeschylus Prometheus
Bound which was viewable in Greek and English pretty much in the same
segments together MYLONAS demonstrated tools to use with the Greek text
something not possible with a book  looking up the dictionary entry form
of an unfamiliar word in Greek after subjecting it to Perseus
morphological analysis for all the texts  After finding out about a
