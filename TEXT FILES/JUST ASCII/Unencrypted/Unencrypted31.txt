Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed
Labour as to debar us when we need
Refreshment whether food or talk between
Food of the mind or this sweet intercourse
Of looks and smiles for smiles from reason flow
To brute denied and are of love the food
Love not the lowest end of human life
For not to irksome toil but to delight
He made us and delight to reason joined
These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands
Will keep from wilderness with ease as wide
As we need walk till younger hands ere long
Assist us But if much converse perhaps
Thee satiate to short absence I could yield
For solitude sometimes is best society
And short retirement urges sweet return
But other doubt possesses me lest harm
Befall thee severed from me for thou knowest
What hath been warned us what malicious foe
Envying our happiness and of his own
Despairing seeks to work us woe and shame
By sly assault and somewhere nigh at hand
Watches no doubt with greedy hope to find
His wish and best advantage us asunder
Hopeless to circumvent us joined where each
To other speedy aid might lend at need
Whether his first design be to withdraw
Our fealty from God or to disturb
Conjugal love than which perhaps no bliss
Enjoyed by us excites his envy more
Or this or worse leave not the faithful side
That gave thee being still shades thee and protects
The wife where danger or dishonour lurks
Safest and seemliest by her husband stays
Who guards her or with her the worst endures
To whom the virgin majesty of Eve
As one who loves and some unkindness meets
With sweet austere composure thus replied
Offspring of Heaven and Earth and all Earths Lord
That such an enemy we have who seeks
Our ruin both by thee informed I learn
And from the parting Angel overheard
As in a shady nook I stood behind
Just then returned at shut of evening flowers
But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
To God or thee because we have a foe
May tempt it I expected not to hear
His violence thou fearest not being such
As we not capable of death or pain
Can either not receive or can repel
His fraud is then thy fear which plain infers
Thy equal fear that my firm faith and love
Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced
Thoughts which how found they harbour in thy breast
Adam misthought of her to thee so dear?
To whom with healing words Adam replied
Daughter of God and Man immortal Eve
For such thou art from sin and blame entire
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade
Thy absence from my sight but to avoid
The attempt itself intended by our foe
For he who tempts though in vain at least asperses
The tempted with dishonour foul supposed
Not incorruptible of faith not proof
Against temptation Thou thyself with scorn
And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong
Though ineffectual found misdeem not then
If such affront I labour to avert
From thee alone which on us both at once
The enemy though bold will hardly dare
Or daring first on me the assault shall light
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn
Subtle he needs must be who could seduce
Angels nor think superfluous others aid
I from the influence of thy looks receive
Access in every virtue in thy sight
More wise more watchful stronger if need were
Of outward strength while shame thou looking on
Shame to be overcome or overreached
Would utmost vigour raise and raised unite
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
When I am present and thy trial choose
With me best witness of thy virtue tried?
So spake domestick Adam in his care
And matrimonial love but Eve who thought
Less attributed to her faith sincere
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed
If this be our condition thus to dwell
In narrow circuit straitened by a foe
Subtle or violent we not endued
Single with like defence wherever met
How are we happy still in fear of harm?
But harm precedes not sin only our foe
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
Of our integrity his foul esteem
Sticks no dishonour on our front but turns
Foul on himself then wherefore shunned or feared
By us? who rather double honour gain
From his surmise proved false find peace within
Favour from Heaven our witness from the event
And what is faith love virtue unassayed
Alone without exteriour help sustained?
Let us not then suspect our happy state
Left so imperfect by the Maker wise
As not secure to single or combined
Frail is our happiness if this be so
And Eden were no Eden thus exposed
To whom thus Adam fervently replied
O Woman best are all things as the will
Of God ordained them His creating hand
Nothing imperfect or deficient left
Of all that he created much less Man
Or aught that might his happy state secure
Secure from outward force within himself
The danger lies yet lies within his power
Against his will he can receive no harm
But God left free the will for what obeys
Reason is free and Reason he made right
But bid her well be ware and still erect
Lest by some fairappearing good surprised
She dictate false and misinform the will
To do what God expressly hath forbid
Not then mistrust but tender love enjoins
That I should mind thee oft and mind thou me
Firm we subsist yet possible to swerve
Since Reason not impossibly may meet
Some specious object by the foe suborned
And fall into deception unaware
Not keeping strictest watch as she was warned
Seek not temptation then which to avoid
Were better and most likely if from me
Thou sever not Trial will come unsought
Wouldst thou approve thy constancy approve
First thy obedience the other who can know
Not seeing thee attempted who attest?
But if thou think trial unsought may find
Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest
Go for thy stay not free absents thee more
Go in thy native innocence rely
On what thou hast of virtue summon all
For God towards thee hath done his part do thine
So spake the patriarch of mankind but Eve
Persisted yet submiss though last replied
With thy permission then and thus forewarned
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
Touched only that our trial when least sought
May find us both perhaps far less prepared
The willinger I go nor much expect
A foe so proud will first the weaker seek
So bent the more shall shame him his repulse
Thus saying from her husbands hand her hand
Soft she withdrew and like a WoodNymph light
Oread or Dryad or of Delias train
Betook her to the groves but Delias self
In gait surpassed and Goddesslike deport
Though not as she with bow and quiver armed
But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude
Guiltless of fire had formed or Angels brought
To Pales or Pomona thus adorned
Likest she seemed Pomona when she fled
Vertumnus or to Ceres in her prime
Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove
Her long with ardent look his eye pursued
Delighted but desiring more her stay
Oft he to her his charge of quick return
Repeated she to him as oft engaged
To be returned by noon amid the bower
And all things in best order to invite
Noontide repast or afternoons repose
O much deceived much failing hapless Eve
Of thy presumed return event perverse
Thou never from that hour in Paradise
Foundst either sweet repast or sound repose
Such ambush hid among sweet flowers and shades
Waited with hellish rancour imminent
To intercept thy way or send thee back
Despoiled of innocence of faith of bliss
For now and since first break of dawn the Fiend
Mere serpent in appearance forth was come
And on his quest where likeliest he might find
The only two of mankind but in them
The whole included race his purposed prey
In bower and field he sought where any tuft
Of grove or gardenplot more pleasant lay
Their tendance or plantation for delight
By fountain or by shady rivulet
He sought them both but wished his hap might find
Eve separate he wished but not with hope
Of what so seldom chanced when to his wish
Beyond his hope Eve separate he spies
Veiled in a cloud of fragrance where she stood
Half spied so thick the roses blushing round
About her glowed oft stooping to support
Each flower of slender stalk whose head though gay
Carnation purple azure or specked with gold
Hung drooping unsustained them she upstays
Gently with myrtle band mindless the while
Herself though fairest unsupported flower
From her best prop so far and storm so nigh
Nearer he drew and many a walk traversed
Of stateliest covert cedar pine or palm
Then voluble and bold now hid now seen
Among thickwoven arborets and flowers
Imbordered on each bank the hand of Eve
Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned
Or of revived Adonis or renowned
Alcinous host of old Laertes son
Or that not mystick where the sapient king
Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse
Much he the place admired the person more
As one who long in populous city pent
Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air
Forth issuing on a summers morn to breathe
Among the pleasant villages and farms
Adjoined from each thing met conceives delight
The smell of grain or tedded grass or kine
Or dairy each rural sight each rural sound
If chance with nymphlike step fair virgin pass
What pleasing seemed for her now pleases more
She most and in her look sums all delight
Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold
This flowery plat the sweet recess of Eve
Thus early thus alone Her heavenly form
Angelick but more soft and feminine
Her graceful innocence her every air
Of gesture or least action overawed
His malice and with rapine sweet bereaved
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought
That space the Evilone abstracted stood
From his own evil and for the time remained
Stupidly good of enmity disarmed
Of guile of hate of envy of revenge
But the hot Hell that always in him burns
Though in mid Heaven soon ended his delight
And tortures him now more the more he sees
Of pleasure not for him ordained then soon
Fierce hate he recollects and all his thoughts
Of mischief gratulating thus excites
Thoughts whither have ye led me with what sweet
Compulsion thus transported to forget
What hither brought us hate not lovenor hope
Of Paradise for Hell hope here to taste
Of pleasure but all pleasure to destroy
Save what is in destroying other joy
