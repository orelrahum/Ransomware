Albania Economy

Overview
    The Albanian economy already providing the lowest standard of living in
    Europe contracted sharply in  with most industries producing at only a
    fraction of past levels and an unemployment rate estimated at  For over
     years the Stalinisttype economy has operated on the principle of
    central planning and state ownership of the means of production Albania
    began fitful economic reforms during  including the liberalization of
    prices and trade the privatization of shops and transport and land reform
    These reform measures were crippled however by the widespread civil
    disorder that accompanied the collapse of the Communist state Following
    their overwhelming victory in the  March  elections the new
    Democratic government announced a program of shock therapy to stabilize the
    economy and establish a market economy In an effort to expand international
    ties Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the former Soviet
    Union and the US and has joined the IMF and World Bank The Albanians have
    also passed legislation allowing foreign investment Albania possesses
    considerable mineral resources and until  was largely selfsufficient
    in food however the breakup of cooperative farms in  and general
    economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign aid to maintain adequate
    supplies Available statistics on Albanian economic activity are rudimentary
    and subject to an especially wide margin of error

Algeria Economy

Overview
    The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy Algeria
    depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its export receipts about  of
    government revenues and nearly  of GDP In  the sharp increase in
    oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
    program of industrialization Plunging oil and gas prices combined with the
    mismanagement of Algerias highly centralized economy has brought the
    nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence in
     The government has promised farreaching reforms including
    privatization of some public sector companies encouraging privatesector
    activity boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports and proposing a major
    overhaul of the banking and financial systems but to date it has made only
    limited progress
