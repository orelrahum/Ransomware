    bauxite prices which started in the late s and continued until late 
    was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in the interior that
    crippled the important bauxite sector Although the insurgency has since
    ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered a military coup in December 
    reflected continued political instability and deterred investment and
    economic reform High inflation high unemployment widespread black market
