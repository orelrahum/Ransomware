Towards either throne they bow and to the ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold
Immortal amarant a flower which once
In Paradise fast by the tree of life
Began to bloom but soon for mans offence
To Heaven removed where first it grew there grows
And flowers aloft shading the fount of life
And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven
Rolls oer Elysian flowers her amber stream
With these that never fade the Spirits elect
Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams
Now in loose garlands thick thrown off the bright
Pavement that like a sea of jasper shone
Impurpled with celestial roses smiled
Then crowned again their golden harps they took
Harps ever tuned that glittering by their side
Like quivers hung and with preamble sweet
Of charming symphony they introduce
Their sacred song and waken raptures high
No voice exempt no voice but well could join
Melodious part such concord is in Heaven
Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent
Immutable Immortal Infinite
Eternal King the Author of all being
Fonntain of light thyself invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitst
Throned inaccessible but when thou shadest
The full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear
Yet dazzle Heaven that brightest Seraphim
Approach not but with both wings veil their eyes
Thee next they sang of all creation first
Begotten Son Divine Similitude
In whose conspicuous countenance without cloud
Made visible the Almighty Father shines
Whom else no creature can behold on thee
Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests
He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
By thee created and by thee threw down
The aspiring Dominations  Thou that day
Thy Fathers dreadful thunder didst not spare
Nor stop thy flaming chariotwheels that shook
Heavens everlasting frame while oer the necks
