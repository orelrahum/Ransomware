Sweden Economy

Overview
    Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I through
    World War II Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
    mixed system of hightech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits It has
    essentially full employment a modern distribution system excellent
    internal and external communications and a skilled labor force Timber
    hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is
    heavily oriented toward foreign trade Privately owned firms account for
    about  of industrial output of which the engineering sector accounts for
     of output and exports In the last few years however this
    extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by inflation growing
    absenteeism and a gradual loss of competitiveness in international markets
    The new centerright government facing a sagging economic situation which
    is unlikely to improve until  is pushing full steam ahead with economic
    reform proposals to end Swedens recession and to prepare for possible EC
    membership in  The freemarketoriented reforms are designed to spur
    growth maintain price stability lower unemployment create a more
    efficient welfare state and further adapt to EC standards The measures
    include cutting taxes particularly the valueadded tax VAT and levies on
    new and small business privatization liberalizing foreign ownership
    restrictions and opening the welfare system to competition and private
    alternatives which the government will still finance Growth is expected to
    remain flat in  but increase slightly in  while inflation should
    remain around  for the next few years On the down side unemployment may
    climb to slightly over  in  and the budget deficit will reach nearly
     billion in

Switzerland Economy

Overview
    Switzerlands economic success is matched in few other nations Per capita
    output general living standards education and science health care and
    diet are unsurpassed in Europe Economic stability helps promote the
    important banking and tourist sectors Since World War II Switzerlands
    economy has adjusted smoothly to the great changes in output and trade
    patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust to the challenges of the s
    particularly to the further economic integration of Western Europe and the
    amazingly rapid changes in East European political and economic prospects
    After  years of growth the economy experienced a mild recession in 
    because monetary policy was tightened to combat inflation and because of the
    weak international economy In the second half of  however Switzerland
    is expected to resume growth despite inflation and unemployment problems
    GDP growth for  may be just under  inflation should drop from  to
     and the trade deficit will continue to decline after dropping by over
     to  billion due to increased exports to Germany Unemployment
    however is forecast to rise to  in  up from  in  and
