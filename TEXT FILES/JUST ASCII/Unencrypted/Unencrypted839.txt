Easing their flight so steers the prudent crane
Her annual voyage borne on winds the air
Floats as they pass fanned with unnumbered plumes
From branch to branch the smaller birds with song
Solaced the woods and spread their painted wings
Till even nor then the solemn nightingale
Ceased warbling but all night tund her soft lays
Others on silver lakes and rivers bathed
Their downy breast the swan with arched neck
Between her white wings mantling proudly rows
Her state with oary feet yet oft they quit
The dank and rising on stiff pennons tower
The mid aereal sky  Others on ground
Walked firm the crested cock whose clarion sounds
The silent hours and the other whose gay train
Adorns him coloured with the florid hue
Of rainbows and starry eyes  The waters thus
With fish replenished and the air with fowl
Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day
The sixth and of creation last arose
With evening harps and matin when God said
Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind
Cattle and creeping things and beast of the Earth
Each in their kind  The Earth obeyed and straight
Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth
Innumerous living creatures perfect forms
Limbed and full grown  Out of the ground up rose
As from his lair the wild beast where he wons
In forest wild in thicket brake or den
Among the trees in pairs they rose they walked
The cattle in the fields and meadows green
Those rare and solitary these in flocks
Pasturing at once and in broad herds upsprung
The grassy clods now calved now half appeared
The tawny lion pawing to get free
His hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds
And rampant shakes his brinded mane the ounce
The libbard and the tiger as the mole
Rising the crumbled earth above them threw
In hillocks  The swift stag from under ground
Bore up his branching head  Scarce from his mould
Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved
His vastness  Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose
As plants  Ambiguous between sea and land
The riverhorse and scaly crocodile
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground
Insect or worm those waved their limber fans
For wings and smallest lineaments exact
In all the liveries decked of summers pride
With spots of gold and purple azure and green
These as a line their long dimension drew
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace not all
Minims of nature some of serpentkind
Wonderous in length and corpulence involved
Their snaky folds and added wings  First crept
The parsimonious emmet provident
Of future in small room large heart enclosed
Pattern of just equality perhaps
Hereafter joined in her popular tribes
Of commonalty  Swarming next appeared
The female bee that feeds her husband drone
Deliciously and builds her waxen cells
With honey stored  The rest are numberless
And thou their natures knowest and gavest them names
Needless to thee repeated nor unknown
The serpent subtlest beast of all the field
Of huge extent sometimes with brazen eyes
And hairy mane terrifick though to thee
Not noxious but obedient at thy call
Now Heaven in all her glory shone and rolled
Her motions as the great first Movers hand
First wheeled their course  Earth in her rich attire
Consummate lovely smiled air water earth
By fowl fish beast was flown was swum was walked
Frequent and of the sixth day yet remained
There wanted yet the masterwork the end
Of all yet done a creature who not prone
And brute as other creatures but endued
With sanctity of reason might erect
His stature and upright with front serene
Govern the rest selfknowing and from thence
Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
Descends thither with heart and voice and eyes
Directed in devotion to adore
And worship God Supreme who made him chief
Of all his works  therefore the Omnipotent
Eternal Father for where is not he
Present? thus to his Son audibly spake
Let us make now Man in our image Man
In our similitude and let them rule
Over the fish and fowl of sea and air
Beast of the field and over all the Earth
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground
This said he formed thee Adam thee O Man
Dust of the ground and in thy nostrils breathed
The breath of life in his own image he
Created thee in the image of God
Express and thou becamest a living soul
Male he created thee but thy consort
Female for race then blessed mankind and said
Be fruitful multiply and fill the Earth
Subdue it and throughout dominion hold
Over fish of the sea and fowl of the air
And every living thing that moves on the Earth
Wherever thus created for no place
Is yet distinct by name thence as thou knowest
He brought thee into this delicious grove
This garden planted with the trees of God
Delectable both to behold and taste
And freely all their pleasant fruit for food
Gave thee all sorts are here that all the Earth yields
Variety without end but of the tree
Which tasted works knowledge of good and evil
Thou mayest not in the day thou eatest thou diest
Death is the penalty imposed beware
And govern well thy appetite lest Sin
Surprise thee and her black attendant Death
Here finished he and all that he had made
Viewed and behold all was entirely good
So even and morn accomplished the sixth day
Yet not till the Creator from his work
Desisting though unwearied up returned
Up to the Heaven of Heavens his high abode
Thence to behold this new created world
The addition of his empire how it showed
In prospect from his throne how good how fair
Answering his great idea  Up he rode
Followed with acclamation and the sound
Symphonious of ten thousand harps that tuned
Angelick harmonies  The earth the air
Resounded thou rememberest for thou heardst
The heavens and all the constellations rung
The planets in their station listening stood
While the bright pomp ascended jubilant
Open ye everlasting gates they sung
Open ye Heavens your living doorslet in
The great Creator from his work returned
Magnificent his six days work a World
Open and henceforth oft for God will deign
To visit oft the dwellings of just men
Delighted and with frequent intercourse
Thither will send his winged messengers
On errands of supernal grace  So sung
The glorious train ascending  He through Heaven
That opened wide her blazing portals led
To Gods eternal house direct the way
A broad and ample road whose dust is gold
And pavement stars as stars to thee appear
Seen in the galaxy that milky way
Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
Powdered with stars  And now on Earth the seventh
Evening arose in Eden for the sun
Was set and twilight from the east came on
Forerunning night when at the holy mount
Of Heavens highseated top the imperial throne
Of Godhead fixed for ever firm and sure
The Filial Power arrived and sat him down
With his great Father for he also went
Invisible yet staid such privilege
Hath Omnipresence and the work ordained
Author and End of all things and from work
Now resting blessed and hallowed the seventh day
As resting on that day from all his work
But not in silence holy kept the harp
Had work and rested not the solemn pipe
And dulcimer all organs of sweet stop
All sounds on fret by string or golden wire
Tempered soft tunings intermixed with voice
Choral or unison of incense clouds
Fuming from golden censers hid the mount
Creation and the six days acts they sung
Great are thy works Jehovah infinite
Thy power what thought can measure thee or tongue
Relate thee  Greater now in thy return
Than from the giant Angels  Thee that day
Thy thunders magnified but to create
Is greater than created to destroy
Who can impair thee Mighty King or bound
Thy empire  Easily the proud attempt
Of Spirits apostate and their counsels vain
Thou hast repelled while impiously they thought
Thee to diminish and from thee withdraw
The number of thy worshippers  Who seeks
To lessen thee against his purpose serves
To manifest the more thy might his evil
Thou usest and from thence createst more good
Witness this newmade world another Heaven
From Heavengate not far founded in view
On the clear hyaline the glassy sea
Of amplitude almost immense with stars
Numerous and every star perhaps a world
Of destined habitation but thou knowest
Their seasons among these the seat of Men
Earth with her nether ocean circumfused
Their pleasant dwellingplace  Thrice happy Men
And sons of Men whom God hath thus advanced
Created in his image there to dwell
And worship him and in reward to rule
Over his works on earth in sea or air
And multiply a race of worshippers
Holy and just  Thrice happy if they know
Their happiness and persevere upright
So sung they and the empyrean rung
With halleluiahs  Thus was sabbath kept
And thy request think now fulfilled that asked
How first this world and face of things began
And what before thy memory was done
From the beginning that posterity
Informed by thee might know  If else thou seekest
Aught not surpassing human measure say



Book VIII


The Angel ended and in Adams ear
So charming left his voice that he a while
Thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear
Then as new waked thus gratefully replied
What thanks sufficient or what recompence
Equal have I to render thee divine
Historian who thus largely hast allayed
The thirst I had of knowledge and vouchsafed
This friendly condescension to relate
Things else by me unsearchable now heard
With wonder but delight and as is due
With glory attributed to the high
Creator  Something yet of doubt remains
Which only thy solution can resolve
When I behold this goodly frame this world
Of Heaven and Earth consisting and compute
Their magnitudes this Earth a spot a grain
An atom with the firmament compared
And all her numbered stars that seem to roll
Spaces incomprehensible for such
Their distance argues and their swift return
Diurnal merely to officiate light
Round this opacous Earth this punctual spot
One day and night in all her vast survey
Useless besides reasoning I oft admire
How Nature wise and frugal could commit
Such disproportions with superfluous hand
So many nobler bodies to create
Greater so manifold to this one use
For aught appears and on their orbs impose
Such restless revolution day by day
Repeated while the sedentary Earth
That better might with far less compass move
Served by more noble than herself attains
Her end without least motion and receives
As tribute such a sumless journey brought
Of incorporeal speed her warmth and light
Speed to describe whose swiftness number fails
So spake our sire and by his countenance seemed
Entering on studious thoughts abstruse which Eve
Perceiving where she sat retired in sight
With lowliness majestick from her seat
And grace that won who saw to wish her stay
Rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers
To visit how they prospered bud and bloom
Her nursery they at her coming sprung
And touched by her fair tendance gladlier grew
Yet went she not as not with such discourse
Delighted or not capable her ear
Of what was high such pleasure she reserved
Adam relating she sole auditress
Her husband the relater she preferred
Before the Angel and of him to ask
Chose rather he she knew would intermix
Grateful digressions and solve high dispute
With conjugal caresses from his lip
Not words alone pleased her  O when meet now
Such pairs in love and mutual honour joined?
With Goddesslike demeanour forth she went
Not unattended for on her as Queen
A pomp of winning Graces waited still
And from about her shot darts of desire
Into all eyes to wish her still in sight
And Raphael now to Adams doubt proposed
Benevolent and facile thus replied
To ask or search I blame thee not for Heaven
Is as the book of God before thee set
Wherein to read his wonderous works and learn
His seasons hours or days or months or years
This to attain whether Heaven move or Earth
Imports not if thou reckon right the rest
From Man or Angel the great Architect
Did wisely to conceal and not divulge
His secrets to be scanned by them who ought
Rather admire or if they list to try
Conjecture he his fabrick of the Heavens
Hath left to their disputes perhaps to move
His laughter at their quaint opinions wide
Hereafter when they come to model Heaven
And calculate the stars how they will wield
The mighty frame how build unbuild contrive
To save appearances how gird the sphere
With centrick and eccentrick scribbled oer
Cycle and epicycle orb in orb
Already by thy reasoning this I guess
Who art to lead thy offspring and supposest
That bodies bright and greater should not serve
The less not bright nor Heaven such journeys run
Earth sitting still when she alone receives
The benefit  Consider first that great
Or bright infers not excellence the Earth
Though in comparison of Heaven so small
Nor glistering may of solid good contain
More plenty than the sun that barren shines
Whose virtue on itself works no effect
But in the fruitful Earth there first received
His beams unactive else their vigour find
Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries
Officious but to thee Earths habitant
And for the Heavens wide circuit let it speak
The Makers high magnificence who built
So spacious and his line stretched out so far
That Man may know he dwells not in his own
An edifice too large for him to fill
Lodged in a small partition and the rest
Ordained for uses to his Lord best known
The swiftness of those circles attribute
Though numberless to his Omnipotence
That to corporeal substances could add
Speed almost spiritual  Me thou thinkest not slow
Who since the morninghour set out from Heaven
Where God resides and ere midday arrived
In Eden distance inexpressible
By numbers that have name  But this I urge
Admitting motion in the Heavens to show
Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved
Not that I so affirm though so it seem
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth
God to remove his ways from human sense
Placed Heaven from Earth so far that earthly sight
If it presume might err in things too high
And no advantage gain  What if the sun
Be center to the world and other stars
By his attractive virtue and their own
Incited dance about him various rounds?
Their wandering course now high now low then hid
Progressive retrograde or standing still
In six thou seest and what if seventh to these
The planet earth so stedfast though she seem
Insensibly three different motions move?
Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe
Moved contrary with thwart obliquities
Or save the sun his labour and that swift
Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed
Invisible else above all stars the wheel
Of day and night which needs not thy belief
If earth industrious of herself fetch day
Travelling east and with her part averse
From the suns beam meet night her other part
Still luminous by his ray  What if that light
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air
To the terrestrial moon be as a star
Enlightening her by day as she by night
This earth? reciprocal if land be there
Fields and inhabitants  Her spots thou seest
As clouds and clouds may rain and rain produce
Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat
Allotted there and other suns perhaps
With their attendant moons thou wilt descry
Communicating male and female light
Which two great sexes animate the world
Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed
By living soul desart and desolate
Only to shine yet scarce to contribute
Each orb a glimpse of light conveyed so far
Down to this habitable which returns
Light back to them is obvious to dispute
But whether thus these things or whether not
But whether the sun predominant in Heaven
Rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun
He from the east his flaming road begin
Or she from west her silent course advance
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
On her soft axle while she paces even
And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid
Leave them to God above him serve and fear
Of other creatures as him pleases best
Wherever placed let him dispose joy thou
In what he gives to thee this Paradise
And thy fair Eve Heaven is for thee too high
To know what passes there be lowly wise
Think only what concerns thee and thy being
Dream not of other worlds what creatures there
Live in what state condition or degree
Contented that thus far hath been revealed
Not of Earth only but of highest Heaven
To whom thus Adam cleared of doubt replied
How fully hast thou satisfied me pure
Intelligence of Heaven Angel serene
And freed from intricacies taught to live
The easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts
To interrupt the sweet of life from which
God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares
And not molest us unless we ourselves
Seek them with wandering thoughts and notions vain
But apt the mind or fancy is to rove
Unchecked and of her roving is no end
Till warned or by experience taught she learn
That not to know at large of things remote
From use obscure and subtle but to know
That which before us lies in daily life
Is the prime wisdom  What is more is fume
Or emptiness or fond impertinence
And renders us in things that most concern
Unpractised unprepared and still to seek
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
A lower flight and speak of things at hand
Useful whence haply mention may arise
Of something not unseasonable to ask
By sufferance and thy wonted favour deigned
Thee I have heard relating what was done
Ere my remembrance now hear me relate
My story which perhaps thou hast not heard
And day is not yet spent till then thou seest
How subtly to detain thee I devise
Inviting thee to hear while I relate
Fond were it not in hope of thy reply
For while I sit with thee I seem in Heaven
And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear
Than fruits of palmtree pleasantest to thirst
And hunger both from labour at the hour
Of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill
Though pleasant but thy words with grace divine
Imbued bring to their sweetness no satiety
To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek
Nor are thy lips ungraceful Sire of men
Nor tongue ineloquent for God on thee
Abundantly his gifts hath also poured
Inward and outward both his image fair
Speaking or mute all comeliness and grace
Attends thee and each word each motion forms
Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth
Than of our fellowservant and inquire
Gladly into the ways of God with Man
For God we see hath honoured thee and set
On Man his equal love  Say therefore on
For I that day was absent as befel
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure
Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell
Squared in full legion such command we had
