    downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US recession

Armenia Economy

Overview
    Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built up textile
    machinebuilding and other industries and had become a key supplier to
    sister republics In turn Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials
    and energy from the other republics Most of these supplies enter the
    republic by rail through Azerbaijan  and Georgia  The economy has
    been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the
    NagornoKarabakh Autonomous Oblast a mostly Armenianpopulated enclave
    within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan In addition to outright
    warfare the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the
    Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleagured
    Armenians in NagornoKarabakh An earthquake in December  destroyed
    about onetenth of industrial capacity and housing the repair of which has
    not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been
    disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central
    USSR administrative apparatus Among facilities made unserviceable by the
    earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant which had supplied  of
    Armenias needs for electric power and a plant that produced onequarter of
    the output of elevators in the former USSR Armenia has some deposits of
    nonferrous metal ores bauxite copper zinc and molybdenum that are
    largely unexploited For the midterm Armenias economic prospects seem
    particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high
    dependence on outside areas themselves in a chaotic state of
    transformation
