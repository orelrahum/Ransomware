Industries
    industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology especially in
    computers robotics telecommunications and medicines and medical
    equipment most of these advances take place in OECD nations only a small
    portion of nonOECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
    technological forces and the technological gap between the industrial
    nations and the lessdeveloped countries continues to widen the rapid
    development of new industrial and agricultural technology is complicating
    already grim environmental problems

    the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last
     years The annual production of cereals for instance has risen by

    production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
    increases in planted areas while global production is sufficient for
    aggregate demand about onefifth of the worlds population remains
