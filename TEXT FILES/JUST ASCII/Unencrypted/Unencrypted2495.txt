CDROM software does not network for a variety of reasons LYNCH said
He speculated that CDROM publishers are not eager to have their products
really hook into wide area networks because they fear it will make their
data suppliers nervous  Moreover until relatively recently one had to
be rather adroit to run a full TCPIP stack plus applications on a
PCsize machine whereas nowadays it is becoming easier as PCs grow
bigger and faster  LYNCH also speculated that software providers had not
heard from their customers until the last year or so or had not heard
from enough of their customers

Howard BESSER School of Library and Information Science University of
Pittsburgh spoke primarily about multimedia focusing on images and the
broad implications of disseminating them on the network  He argued that
planning the distribution of multimedia documents posed two critical
implementation problems which he framed in the form of two questions
 What platform will one use and what hardware and software will users
have for viewing of the material?  and  How can one deliver a
sufficiently robust set of information in an accessible format in a
reasonable amount of time?  Depending on whether network or CDROM is the
medium used this question raises different issues of storage
compression and transmission

Concerning the design of platforms eg sound gray scale simple
color etc and the various capabilities users may have BESSER
maintained that a layered approach was the way to deal with users
capabilities  A result would be that users with less powerful
workstations would simply have less functionality  He urged members of
the audience to advocate standards and accompanying software that handle
layered functionality across a wide variety of platforms

BESSER also addressed problems in platform design namely deciding how
large a machine to design for situations when the largest number of users
have the lowest level of the machine and one desires higher
functionality  BESSER then proceeded to the question of file size and
its implications for networking  He discussed still images in the main
For example a digital color image that fills the screen of a standard
megapel workstation Sun or Next will require one megabyte of storage
for an eightbit image or three megabytes of storage for a true color or
twentyfourbit image  Lossless compression algorithms that is
computational procedures in which no data is lost in the process of
compressing and decompressing an imagethe exact bitrepresentation is
maintained might bring storage down to a third of a megabyte per image
but not much further than that  The question of size makes it difficult
to fit an appropriately sized set of these images on a single disk or to
transmit them quickly enough on a network

With these full screen megapel images that constitute a third of a
megabyte one gets  fullscreen images on a onegigabyte disk
a standard CDROM represents approximately  percent of that  Storing
images the size of a PC screen just  bit color increases storage
capacity to  images per gigabyte  percent of that gives
one the size of a CDROM which in turn creates a major problem  One
cannot have fullscreen fullcolor images with lossless compression one
must compress them or use a lower resolution  For megabytesize images
anything slower than a T speed is impractical  For example on a
fiftysixkilobaud line it takes three minutes to transfer a
onemegabyte file if it is not compressed and this speed assumes ideal
circumstances no other user contending for network bandwidth  Thus
questions of disk access remote display and current telephone
connection speed make transmission of megabytesize images impractical

BESSER then discussed ways to deal with these large images for example
compression and decompression at the users end  In this connection the
