	In the spring time the only pretty ring time
	When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
	Sweet lovers love the spring

	Between the acres of the rye
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	These pretty country folks would lie
	In spring time c

	This carol they began that hour
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	How that a life was but a flower
	In spring time c

	And therefore take the present time
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	For love is crowned with the prime
	In spring time c
