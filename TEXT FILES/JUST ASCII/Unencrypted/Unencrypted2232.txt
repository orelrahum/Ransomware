That I was heard with favour peace returned
Home to my breast and to my memory
His promise that thy seed shall bruise our foe
Which then not minded in dismay yet now
Assures me that the bitterness of death
Is past and we shall live  Whence hail to thee
Eve rightly called mother of all mankind
Mother of all things living since by thee
Man is to live and all things live for Man
To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek
Illworthy I such title should belong
To me transgressour who for thee ordained
A help became thy snare to me reproach
Rather belongs distrust and all dispraise
But infinite in pardon was my Judge
That I who first brought death on all am graced
The source of life next favourable thou
Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsafst
Far other name deserving  But the field
To labour calls us now with sweat imposed
Though after sleepless night for seethe morn
All unconcerned with our unrest begins
Her rosy progress smiling let us forth
I never from thy side henceforth to stray
Whereer our days work lies though now enjoined
Laborious till day droop while here we dwell
What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?
Here let us live though in fallen state content
So spake so wished much humbled Eve but Fate
Subscribed not  Nature first gave signs impressed
On bird beast air air suddenly eclipsed
After short blush of morn nigh in her sight
The bird of Jove stooped from his aery tour
Two birds of gayest plume before him drove
Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods
First hunter then pursued a gentle brace
Goodliest of all the forest hart and hind
Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight
Adam observed and with his eye the chase
Pursuing not unmoved to Eve thus spake
O Eve some further change awaits us nigh
Which Heaven by these mute signs in Nature shows
Forerunners of his purpose or to warn
Us haply too secure of our discharge
From penalty because from death released
Some days how long and what till then our life
Who knows? or more than this that we are dust
And thither must return and be no more?
Why else this double object in our sight
Of flight pursued in the air and oer the ground
One way the selfsame hour? why in the east
Darkness ere days midcourse and morninglight
More orient in yon western cloud that draws
Oer the blue firmament a radiant white
And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?
He erred not for by this the heavenly bands
Down from a sky of jasper lighted now
In Paradise and on a hill made halt
A glorious apparition had not doubt
And carnal fear that day dimmed Adams eye
Not that more glorious when the Angels met
Jacob in Mahanaim where he saw
The field pavilioned with his guardians bright
Nor that which on the flaming mount appeared
In Dothan covered with a camp of fire
Against the Syrian king who to surprise
One man assassinlike had levied war
War unproclaimed  The princely Hierarch
In their bright stand there left his Powers to seise
Possession of the garden he alone
To find where Adam sheltered took his way
Not unperceived of Adam who to Eve
While the great visitant approached thus spake
Eve now expect great tidings which perhaps
Of us will soon determine or impose
New laws to be observed for I descry
From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill
One of the heavenly host and by his gait
None of the meanest some great Potentate
Or of the Thrones above such majesty
Invests him coming yet not terrible
That I should fear nor sociably mild
As Raphael that I should much confide
But solemn and sublime whom not to offend
With reverence I must meet and thou retire
He ended and the ArchAngel soon drew nigh
Not in his shape celestial but as man
Clad to meet man over his lucid arms
A military vest of purple flowed
Livelier than Meliboean or the grain
Of Sarra worn by kings and heroes old
In time of truce Iris had dipt the woof
His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime
In manhood where youth ended by his side
As in a glistering zodiack hung the sword
Satans dire dread and in his hand the spear
Adam bowed low he kingly from his state
Inclined not but his coming thus declared
Adam Heavens high behest no preface needs
Sufficient that thy prayers are heard and Death
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress
Defeated of his seisure many days
Given thee of grace wherein thou mayest repent
And one bad act with many deeds well done
Mayest cover  Well may then thy Lord appeased
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claim
But longer in this Paradise to dwell
Permits not to remove thee I am come
And send thee from the garden forth to till
The ground whence thou wast taken fitter soil
He added not for Adam at the news
Heartstruck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood
That all his senses bound Eve who unseen
Yet all had heard with audible lament
Discovered soon the place of her retire
O unexpected stroke worse than of Death
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
Thee native soil these happy walks and shades
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend
Quiet though sad the respite of that day
That must be mortal to us both  O flowers
That never will in other climate grow
My early visitation and my last
 t even which I bred up with tender hand
From the first opening bud and gave ye names
Who now shall rear ye to the sun or rank
Your tribes and water from the ambrosial fount?
Thee lastly nuptial bower by me adorned
With what to sight or smell was sweet from thee
How shall I part and whither wander down
Into a lower world to this obscure
And wild? how shall we breathe in other air
Less pure accustomed to immortal fruits?
Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild
Lament not Eve but patiently resign
What justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart
Thus overfond on that which is not thine
Thy going is not lonely with thee goes
Thy husband whom to follow thou art bound
Where he abides think there thy native soil
Adam by this from the cold sudden damp
Recovering and his scattered spirits returned
To Michael thus his humble words addressed
Celestial whether among the Thrones or named
Of them the highest for such of shape may seem
Prince above princes gently hast thou told
Thy message which might else in telling wound
And in performing end us what besides
Of sorrow and dejection and despair
Our frailty can sustain thy tidings bring
Departure from this happy place our sweet
Recess and only consolation left
Familiar to our eyes all places else
Inhospitable appear and desolate
Nor knowing us nor known  And if by prayer
Incessant I could hope to change the will
Of Him who all things can I would not cease
To weary him with my assiduous cries
But prayer against his absolute decree
No more avails than breath against the wind
Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth
Therefore to his great bidding I submit
This most afflicts me that departing hence
As from his face I shall be hid deprived
His blessed countenance  Here I could frequent
With worship place by place where he vouchsafed
Presence Divine and to my sons relate
On this mount he appeared under this tree
Stood visible among these pines his voice
I heard here with him at this fountain talked
So many grateful altars I would rear
Of grassy turf and pile up every stone
Of lustre from the brook in memory
Or monument to ages and theron
Offer sweetsmelling gums and fruits and flowers
In yonder nether world where shall I seek
His bright appearances or footstep trace?
For though I fled him angry yet recalled
To life prolonged and promised race I now
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
Of glory and far off his steps adore
To whom thus Michael with regard benign
Adam thou knowest Heaven his and all the Earth
Not this rock only his Omnipresence fills
Land sea and air and every kind that lives
Fomented by his virtual power and warmed
All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule
No despicable gift surmise not then
His presence to these narrow bounds confined
Of Paradise or Eden this had been
Perhaps thy capital seat from whence had spread
All generations and had hither come
From all the ends of the earth to celebrate
And reverence thee their great progenitor
But this preeminence thou hast lost brought down
To dwell on even ground now with thy sons
Yet doubt not but in valley and in plain
God is as here and will be found alike
Present and of his presence many a sign
Still following thee still compassing thee round
With goodness and paternal love his face
Express and of his steps the track divine
Which that thou mayest believe and be confirmed
Ere thou from hence depart know I am sent
To show thee what shall come in future days
To thee and to thy offspring good with bad
Expect to hear supernal grace contending
With sinfulness of men thereby to learn
True patience and to temper joy with fear
And pious sorrow equally inured
By moderation either state to bear
Prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead
Safest thy life and best prepared endure
Thy mortal passage when it comesAscend
This hill let Eve for I have drenched her eyes
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wakest
As once thou sleptst while she to life was formed
To whom thus Adam gratefully replied
Ascend I follow thee safe Guide the path
Thou leadest me and to the hand of Heaven submit
However chastening to the evil turn
My obvious breast arming to overcome
By suffering and earn rest from labour won
If so I may attain  So both ascend
In the visions of God  It was a hill
Of Paradise the highest from whose top
The hemisphere of earth in clearest ken
Stretched out to the amplest reach of prospect lay
Not higher that hill nor wider looking round
Whereon for different cause the Tempter set
Our second Adam in the wilderness
To show him all Earths kingdoms and their glory
His eye might there command wherever stood
City of old or modern fame the seat
Of mightiest empire from the destined walls
Of Cambalu seat of Cathaian Can
And Samarchand by Oxus Temirs throne
To Paquin of Sinaean kings and thence
To Agra and Lahor of great Mogul
Down to the golden Chersonese or where
The Persian in Ecbatan sat or since
In Hispahan or where the Russian Ksar
In Mosco or the Sultan in Bizance
Turchestanborn nor could his eye not ken
The empire of Negus to his utmost port
Ercoco and the less maritim kings
Mombaza and Quiloa and Melind
And Sofala thought Ophir to the realm
Of Congo and Angola farthest south
Or thence from Niger flood to Atlas mount
The kingdoms of Almansor Fez and Sus
Morocco and Algiers and Tremisen
On Europe thence and where Rome was to sway
The world in spirit perhaps he also saw
Rich Mexico the seat of Montezume
And Cusco in Peru the richer seat
Of Atabalipa and yet unspoiled
Guiana whose great city Geryons sons
Call El Dorado  But to nobler sights
Michael from Adams eyes the film removed
Which that false fruit that promised clearer sight
Had bred then purged with euphrasy and rue
The visual nerve for he had much to see
And from the well of life three drops instilled
So deep the power of these ingredients pierced
Even to the inmost seat of mental sight
That Adam now enforced to close his eyes
Sunk down and all his spirits became entranced
But him the gentle Angel by the hand
Soon raised and his attention thus recalled
Adam now ope thine eyes and first behold
The effects which thy original crime hath wrought
In some to spring from thee who never touched
The excepted tree nor with the snake conspired
Nor sinned thy sin yet from that sin derive
Corruption to bring forth more violent deeds
His eyes he opened and beheld a field
Part arable and tilth whereon were sheaves
New reaped the other part sheepwalks and folds
I the midst an altar as the landmark stood
Rustick of grassy sord thither anon
A sweaty reaper from his tillage brought
First fruits the green ear and the yellow sheaf
Unculled as came to hand a shepherd next
More meek came with the firstlings of his flock
Choicest and best then sacrificing laid
The inwards and their fat with incense strowed
On the cleft wood and all due rights performed
His offering soon propitious fire from Heaven
Consumed with nimble glance and grateful steam
The others not for his was not sincere
Whereat he inly raged and as they talked
Smote him into the midriff with a stone
That beat out life he felland deadly pale
Groaned out his soul with gushing blood effused
Much at that sight was Adam in his heart
Dismayed and thus in haste to the Angel cried
O Teacher some great mischief hath befallen
To that meek man who well had sacrificed
Is piety thus and pure devotion paid?
To whom Michael thus he also moved replied
These two are brethren Adam and to come
Out of thy loins the unjust the just hath slain
For envy that his brothers offering found
From Heaven acceptance but the bloody fact
Will be avenged and the others faith approved
Lose no reward though here thou see him die
Rolling in dust and gore  To which our sire
Alas both for the deed and for the cause
But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way
I must return to native dust?  O sight
Of terrour foul and ugly to behold
Horrid to think how horrible to feel
To whom thus Michael  Death thou hast seen
In his first shape on Man but many shapes
Of Death and many are the ways that lead
To his grim cave all dismal yet to sense
More terrible at the entrance than within
Some as thou sawest by violent stroke shall die
By fire flood famine by intemperance more
In meats and drinks which on the earth shall bring
Diseases dire of which a monstrous crew
Before thee shall appear that thou mayest know
What misery the inabstinence of Eve
Shall bring on Men  Immediately a place
Before his eyes appeared sad noisome dark
A lazarhouse it seemed wherein were laid
Numbers of all diseased all maladies
Of ghastly spasm or racking torture qualms
Of heartsick agony all feverous kinds
Convulsions epilepsies fierce catarrhs
Intestine stone and ulcer colickpangs
Demoniack phrenzy moaping melancholy
And moonstruck madness pining atrophy
Marasmus and widewasting pestilence
Dropsies and asthmas and jointracking rheums
Dire was the tossing deep the groans Despair
Tended the sick busiest from couch to couch
And over them triumphant Death his dart
Shook but delayed to strike though oft invoked
With vows as their chief good and final hope
Sight so deform what heart of rock could long
Dryeyed behold?  Adam could not but wept
Though not of woman born compassion quelled
His best of man and gave him up to tears
A space till firmer thoughts restrained excess
And scarce recovering words his plaint renewed
O miserable mankind to what fall
Degraded to what wretched state reserved
Better end here unborn  Why is life given
To be thus wrested from us? rather why
Obtruded on us thus? who if we knew
What we receive would either no accept
Life offered or soon beg to lay it down
Glad to be so dismissed in peace  Can thus
The image of God in Man created once
So goodly and erect though faulty since
To such unsightly sufferings be debased
Under inhuman pains?  Why should not Man
Retaining still divine similitude
In part from such deformities be free
And for his Makers image sake exempt?
Their Makers image answered Michael then
Forsook them when themselves they vilified
To serve ungoverned Appetite and took
His image whom they served a brutish vice
Inductive mainly to the sin of Eve
Therefore so abject is their punishment
Disfiguring not Gods likeness but their own
Or if his likeness by themselves defaced
While they pervert pure Natures healthful rules
To loathsome sickness worthily since they
Gods image did not reverence in themselves
I yield it just said Adam and submit
But is there yet no other way besides
These painful passages how we may come
To death and mix with our connatural dust?
There is said Michael if thou well observe
The rule of Not too much by temperance taught
In what thou eatest and drinkest seeking from thence
Due nourishment not gluttonous delight
Till many years over thy head return
So mayest thou live till like ripe fruit thou drop
Into thy mothers lap or be with ease
Gathered nor harshly plucked for death mature
This is Old Age but then thou must outlive
Thy youth thy strength thy beauty which will change
To withered weak and gray thy senses then
Obtuse all taste of pleasure must forego
To what thou hast and for the air of youth
Hopeful and cheerful in thy blood will reign
A melancholy damp of cold and dry
To weigh thy spirits down and last consume
The balm of life  To whom our ancestor
Henceforth I fly not death nor would prolong
Life much bent rather how I may be quit
Fairest and easiest of this cumbrous charge
Which I must keep till my appointed day
Of rendering up and patiently attend
My dissolution  Michael replied
Nor love thy life nor hate but what thou livest
Live well how long or short permit to Heaven
And now prepare thee for another sight
He looked and saw a spacious plain whereon
Were tents of various hue by some were herds
Of cattle grazing others whence the sound
Of instruments that made melodious chime
Was heard of harp and organ and who moved
Their stops and chords was seen his volant touch
Instinct through all proportions low and high
Fled and pursued transverse the resonant fugue
In other part stood one who at the forge
Labouring two massy clods of iron and brass
Had melted whether found where casual fire
Had wasted woods on mountain or in vale
Down to the veins of earth thence gliding hot
To some caves mouth or whether washed by stream
From underground the liquid ore he drained
Into fit moulds prepared from which he formed
First his own tools then what might else be wrought
Fusil or graven in metal  After these
But on the hither side a different sort
From the high neighbouring hills which was their seat
Down to the plain descended by their guise
Just men they seemed and all their study bent
To worship God aright and know his works
Not hid nor those things last which might preserve
Freedom and peace to Men they on the plain
Long had not walked when from the tents behold
A bevy of fair women richly gay
In gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung
Soft amorous ditties and in dance came on
The men though grave eyed them and let their eyes
Rove without rein till in the amorous net
Fast caught they liked and each his liking chose
And now of love they treat till the eveningstar
Loves harbinger appeared then all in heat
They light the nuptial torch and bid invoke
Hymen then first to marriage rites invoked
With feast and musick all the tents resound
Such happy interview and fair event
Of love and youth not lost songs garlands flowers
And charming symphonies attached the heart
Of Adam soon inclined to admit delight
The bent of nature which he thus expressed
True opener of mine eyes prime Angel blest
Much better seems this vision and more hope
Of peaceful days portends than those two past
Those were of hate and death or pain much worse
Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends
To whom thus Michael  Judge not what is best
By pleasure though to nature seeming meet
Created as thou art to nobler end
Holy and pure conformity divine
Those tents thou sawest so pleasant were the tents
Of wickedness wherein shall dwell his race
Who slew his brother studious they appear
Of arts that polish life inventers rare
Unmindful of their Maker though his Spirit
Taught them but they his gifts acknowledged none
Yet they a beauteous offspring shall beget
For that fair female troop thou sawest that seemed
Of Goddesses so blithe so smooth so gay
Yet empty of all good wherein consists
Womans domestick honour and chief praise
Bred only and completed to the taste
Of lustful appetence to sing to dance
To dress and troll the tongue and roll the eye
To these that sober race of men whose lives
Religious titled them the sons of God
Shall yield up all their virtue all their fame
Ignobly to the trains and to the smiles
Of these fair atheists and now swim in joy
Erelong to swim at large and laugh for which
The world erelong a world of tears must weep
To whom thus Adam of short joy bereft
O pity and shame that they who to live well
Entered so fair should turn aside to tread
Paths indirect or in the mid way faint
But still I see the tenour of Mans woe
Holds on the same from Woman to begin
From Mans effeminate slackness it begins
Said the Angel who should better hold his place
By wisdom and superiour gifts received
But now prepare thee for another scene
He looked and saw wide territory spread
Before him towns and rural works between
Cities of men with lofty gates and towers
Concourse in arms fierce faces threatening war
Giants of mighty bone and bold emprise
Part wield their arms part curb the foaming steed
Single or in array of battle ranged
Both horse and foot nor idly mustering stood
One way a band select from forage drives
A herd of beeves fair oxen and fair kine
From a fat meadow ground or fleecy flock
Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain
Their booty scarce with life the shepherds fly
But call in aid which makes a bloody fray
With cruel tournament the squadrons join
Where cattle pastured late now scattered lies
With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field
Deserted  Others to a city strong
Lay siege encamped by battery scale and mine
Assaulting others from the wall defend
With dart and javelin stones and sulphurous fire
On each hand slaughter and gigantick deeds
In other part the sceptered heralds call
To council in the citygates anon
Grayheaded men and grave with warriours mixed
Assemble and harangues are heard but soon
In factious opposition till at last
Of middle age one rising eminent
In wise deport spake much of right and wrong
Of justice or religion truth and peace
And judgement from above him old and young
Exploded and had seized with violent hands
Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
Unseen amid the throng so violence
Proceeded and oppression and swordlaw
Through all the plain and refuge none was found
Adam was all in tears and to his guide
Lamenting turned full sad Owhat are these
Deaths ministers not men? who thus deal death
Inhumanly to men and multiply
Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
His brother for of whom such massacre
Make they but of their brethren men of men
But who was that just man whom had not Heaven
Rescued had in his righteousness been lost?
To whom thus Michael  These are the product
Of those illmated marriages thou sawest
Where good with bad were matched who of themselves
Abhor to join and by imprudence mixed
Produce prodigious births of body or mind
Such were these giants men of high renown
For in those days might only shall be admired
And valour and heroick virtue called
To overcome in battle and subdue
Nations and bring home spoils with infinite
Manslaughter shall be held the highest pitch
Of human glory and for glory done
Of triumph to be styled great conquerours
Patrons of mankind Gods and sons of Gods
Destroyers rightlier called and plagues of men
Thus fame shall be achieved renown on earth
And what most merits fame in silence hid
But he the seventh from thee whom thou beheldst
The only righteous in a world preverse
And therefore hated therefore so beset
With foes for daring single to be just
And utter odious truth that God would come
To judge them with his Saints him the Most High
Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds
Did as thou sawest receive to walk with God
High in salvation and the climes of bliss
Exempt from death to show thee what reward
Awaits the good the rest what punishment
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold
He looked and saw the face of things quite changed
The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar
All now was turned to jollity and game
To luxury and riot feast and dance
Marrying or prostituting as befel
Rape or adultery where passing fair
Allured them thence from cups to civil broils
At length a reverend sire among them came
And of their doings great dislike declared
And testified against their ways he oft
Frequented their assemblies whereso met
Triumphs or festivals and to them preached
Conversion and repentance as to souls
In prison under judgements imminent
But all in vain which when he saw he ceased
Contending and removed his tents far off
Then from the mountain hewing timber tall
Began to build a vessel of huge bulk
Measured by cubit length and breadth and highth
Smeared round with pitch and in the side a door
Contrived and of provisions laid in large
For man and beast when lo a wonder strange
Of every beast and bird and insect small
Came sevens and pairs and entered in as taught
Their order last the sire and his three sons
With their four wives and God made fast the door
Mean while the southwind rose and with black wings
Widehovering all the clouds together drove
From under Heaven the hills to their supply
Vapour and exhalation dusk and moist
Sent up amain and now the thickened sky
Like a dark cieling stood down rushed the rain
Impetuous and continued till the earth
No more was seen the floating vessel swum
Uplifted and secure with beaked prow
Rode tilting oer the waves all dwellings else
Flood overwhelmed and them with all their pomp
Deep under water rolled sea covered sea
Sea without shore and in their palaces
Where luxury late reigned seamonsters whelped
And stabled of mankind so numerous late
All left in one small bottom swum imbarked
How didst thou grieve then Adam to behold
The end of all thy offspring end so sad
Depopulation  Thee another flood
Of tears and sorrow a flood thee also drowned
And sunk thee as thy sons till gently reared
By the Angel on thy feet thou stoodest at last
Though comfortless as when a father mourns
His children all in view destroyed at once
And scarce to the Angel utterdst thus thy plaint
O visions ill foreseen  Better had I
Lived ignorant of future so had borne
My part of evil only each days lot
Enough to bear those now that were dispensed
The burden of many ages on me light
At once by my foreknowledge gaining birth
Abortive to torment me ere their being
With thought that they must be  Let no man seek
Henceforth to be foretold what shall befall
Him or his children evil he may be sure
Which neither his foreknowing can prevent
And he the future evil shall no less
In apprehension than in substance feel
Grievous to bear but that care now is past
Man is not whom to warn those few escaped
Famine and anguish will at last consume
Wandering that watery desart  I had hope
When violence was ceased and war on earth
All would have then gone well peace would have crowned
With length of happy days the race of Man
But I was far deceived for now I see
Peace to corrupt no less than war to waste
How comes it thus? unfold celestial Guide
And whether here the race of Man will end
To whom thus Michael  Those whom last thou sawest
In triumph and luxurious wealth are they
First seen in acts of prowess eminent
And great exploits but of true virtue void
Who having spilt much blood and done much wast
Subduing nations and achieved thereby
Fame in the world high titles and rich prey
Shall change their course to pleasure ease and sloth
Surfeit and lust till wantonness and pride
Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace
The conquered also and enslaved by war
Shall with their freedom lost all virtue lose
And fear of God from whom their piety feigned
In sharp contest of battle found no aid
Against invaders therefore cooled in zeal
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure
Worldly or dissolute on what their lords
Shall leave them to enjoy for the earth shall bear
More than enough that temperance may be tried
So all shall turn degenerate all depraved
Justice and temperance truth and faith forgot
One man except the only son of light
In a dark age against example good
Against allurement custom and a world
Offended fearless of reproach and scorn
The grandchild with twelve sons encreased departs
From Canaan to a land hereafter called
Egypt divided by the river Nile
See where it flows disgorging at seven mouths
Into the sea  To sojourn in that land
He comes invited by a younger son
In time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds
Raise him to be the second in that realm
Of Pharaoh  There he dies and leaves his race
Growing into a nation and now grown
Suspected to a sequent king who seeks
To stop their overgrowth as inmate guests
Or violence he of their wicked ways
Shall them admonish and before them set
The paths of righteousness how much more safe
And full of peace denouncing wrath to come
On their impenitence and shall return
Of them derided but of God observed
The one just man alive by his command
Shall build a wonderous ark as thou beheldst
To save himself and houshold from amidst
A world devote to universal wrack
No sooner he with them of man and beast
Select for life shall in the ark be lodged
And sheltered round but all the cataracts
Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour
Rain day and night all fountains of the deep
Broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp
Beyond all bounds till inundation rise
Above the highest hills  Then shall this mount
Of Paradise by might of waves be moved
Out of his place pushed by the horned flood
With all his verdure spoiled and trees adrift
Down the great river to the opening gulf
And there take root an island salt and bare
The haunt of seals and orcs and seamews clang
To teach thee that God attributes to place
No sanctity if none be thither brought
By men who there frequent or therein dwell
And now what further shall ensue behold
He looked and saw the ark hull on the flood
Which now abated for the clouds were fled
Driven by a keen northwind that blowing dry
Wrinkled the face of deluge as decayed
And the clear sun on his wide watery glass
Gazed hot and of the fresh wave largely drew
As after thirst which made their flowing shrink
From standing lake to tripping ebb that stole
With soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt
His sluces as the Heaven his windows shut
The ark no more now floats but seems on ground
Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed
And now the tops of hills as rocks appear
With clamour thence the rapid currents drive
Towards the retreating sea their furious tide
Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies
And after him the surer messenger
A dove sent forth once and again to spy
Green tree or ground whereon his foot may light
The second time returning in his bill
An oliveleaf he brings pacifick sign
Anon dry ground appears and from his ark
The ancient sire descends with all his train
Then with uplifted hands and eyes devout
Grateful to Heaven over his head beholds
A dewy cloud and in the cloud a bow
Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay
Betokening peace from God and covenant new
Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad
Greatly rejoiced and thus his joy broke forth
O thou who future things canst represent
As present heavenly Instructer  I revive
At this last sight assured that Man shall live
With all the creatures and their seed preserve
Far less I now lament for one whole world
Of wicked sons destroyed than I rejoice
For one man found so perfect and so just
That God vouchsafes to raise another world
From him and all his anger to forget
But say what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven
Distended as the brow of God appeased?
Or serve they as a flowery verge to bind
The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud
Lest it again dissolve and shower the earth?
To whom the ArchAngel  Dextrously thou aimest
So willingly doth God remit his ire
Though late repenting him of Man depraved
Grieved at his heart when looking down he saw
The whole earth filled with violence and all flesh
Corrupting each their way yet those removed
Such grace shall one just man find in his sight
That he relents not to blot out mankind
And makes a covenant never to destroy
The earth again by flood nor let the sea
Surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world
With man therein or beast but when he brings
Over the earth a cloud will therein set
His triplecoloured bow whereon to look
And call to mind his covenant Day and night
Seedtime and harvest heat and hoary frost
Shall hold their course till fire purge all things new
Both Heaven and Earth wherein the just shall dwell



Book XII


As one who in his journey bates at noon
Though bent on speed so here the ArchAngel paused
Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose
Then with transition sweet new speech resumes
Thus thou hast seen one world begin and end
And Man as from a second stock proceed
Much thou hast yet to see but I perceive
Thy mortal sight to fail objects divine
Must needs impair and weary human sense
Henceforth what is to come I will relate
Thou therefore give due audience and attend
This second source of Men while yet but few
And while the dread of judgement past remains
Fresh in their minds fearing the Deity
With some regard to what is just and right
Shall lead their lives and multiply apace
Labouring the soil and reaping plenteous crop
Corn wine and oil and from the herd or flock
Oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid
With large wineofferings poured and sacred feast
Shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell
Long time in peace by families and tribes
Under paternal rule till one shall rise
Of proud ambitious heart who not content
With fair equality fraternal state
Will arrogate dominion undeserved
Over his brethren and quite dispossess
Concord and law of nature from the earth
Hunting and men not beasts shall be his game
With war and hostile snare such as refuse
Subjection to his empire tyrannous
A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled
Before the Lord as in despite of Heaven
Or from Heaven claiming second sovranty
And from rebellion shall derive his name
Though of rebellion others he accuse
He with a crew whom like ambition joins
With him or under him to tyrannize
Marching from Eden towards the west shall find
The plain wherein a black bituminous gurge
Boils out from under ground the mouth of Hell
Of brick and of that stuff they cast to build
A city and tower whose top may reach to Heaven
And get themselves a name lest far dispersed
In foreign lands their memory be lost
Regardless whether good or evil fame
But God who oft descends to visit men
Unseen and through their habitations walks
To mark their doings them beholding soon
Comes down to see their city ere the tower
Obstruct Heaventowers and in derision sets
Upon their tongues a various spirit to rase
Quite out their native language and instead
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
Among the builders each to other calls
Not understood till hoarse and all in rage
As mocked they storm great laughter was in Heaven
And looking down to see the hubbub strange
And hear the din  Thus was the building left
Ridiculous and the work Confusion named
Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeased
O execrable son so to aspire
Above his brethren to himself assuming
Authority usurped from God not given
He gave us only over beast fish fowl
Dominion absolute that right we hold
By his donation but man over men
He made not lord such title to himself
Reserving human left from human free
But this usurper his encroachment proud
Stays not on Man to God his tower intends
Siege and defiance  Wretched manwhat food
Will he convey up thither to sustain
Himself and his rash army where thin air
Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross
And famish him of breath if not of bread?
To whom thus Michael  Justly thou abhorrest
That son who on the quiet state of men
Such trouble brought affecting to subdue
Rational liberty yet know withal
Since thy original lapse true liberty
Is lost which always with right reason dwells
Twinned and from her hath no dividual being
Reason in man obscured or not obeyed
Immediately inordinate desires
And upstart passions catch the government
From reason and to servitude reduce
Man till then free  Therefore since he permits
Within himself unworthy powers to reign
Over free reason God in judgement just
Subjects him from without to violent lords
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
His outward freedom  Tyranny must be
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low
From virtue which is reason that no wrong
But justice and some fatal curse annexed
Deprives them of their outward liberty
Their inward lost  Witness the irreverent son
Of him who built the ark who for the shame
Done to his father heard this heavy curse
Servant of servants on his vicious race
Thus will this latter as the former world
Still tend from bad to worse till God at last
Wearied with their iniquities withdraw
His presence from among them and avert
His holy eyes resolving from thenceforth
To leave them to their own polluted ways
And one peculiar nation to select
From all the rest of whom to be invoked
A nation from one faithful man to spring
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing
Bred up in idolworship  O that men
Canst thou believe? should be so stupid grown
While yet the patriarch lived who scaped the flood
As to forsake the living God and fall
To worship their own work in wood and stone
For Gods  Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes
To call by vision from his fathers house
His kindred and false Gods into a land
Which he will show him and from him will raise
A mighty nation and upon him shower
His benediction so that in his seed
All nations shall be blest he straight obeys
Not knowing to what land yet firm believes
I see him but thou canst not with what faith
He leaves his Gods his friends and native soil
Ur of Chaldaea passing now the ford
To Haran after him a cumbrous train
Of herds and flocks and numerous servitude
Not wandering poor but trusting all his wealth
With God who called him in a land unknown
Canaan he now attains I see his tents
Pitched about Sechem and the neighbouring plain
Of Moreh there by promise he receives
Gift to his progeny of all that land
From Hameth northward to the Desart south
Things by their names I call though yet unnamed
From Hermon east to the great western Sea
Mount Hermon yonder sea each place behold
In prospect as I point them on the shore
Mount Carmel here the doublefounted stream
Jordan true limit eastward but his sons
Shall dwell to Senir that long ridge of hills
This ponder that all nations of the earth
Shall in his seed be blessed  By that seed
Is meant thy great Deliverer who shall bruise
The Serpents head whereof to thee anon
Plainlier shall be revealed  This patriarch blest
Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call
A son and of his son a grandchild leaves
Like him in faith in wisdom and renown
The grandchild with twelve sons increased departs
From Canaan to a land hereafter called
Egypt divided by the river Nile
See where it flows disgorging at seven mouths
Into the sea To sojourn in that land
He comes invited by a younger son
In time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds
Raise him to be the second in that realm
Of Pharaoh There he dies and leaves his race
Growing into a nation and now grown
Suspected to a sequent king who seeks
To stop their overgrowth as inmate guests
Too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves
Inhospitably and kills their infant males
Till by two brethren these two brethren call
Moses and Aaron sent from God to claim
His people from enthralment they return
With glory and spoil back to their promised land
But first the lawless tyrant who denies
To know their God or message to regard
Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire
To blood unshed the rivers must be turned
Frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill
With loathed intrusion and fill all the land
His cattle must of rot and murren die
Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss
And all his people thunder mixed with hail
Hail mixed with fire must rend the Egyptians sky
And wheel on the earth devouring where it rolls
What it devours not herb or fruit or grain
A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down
Must eat and on the ground leave nothing green
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds
Palpable darkness and blot out three days
Last with one midnight stroke all the firstborn
Of Egypt must lie dead  Thus with ten wounds
The riverdragon tamed at length submits
To let his sojourners depart and oft
Humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice
More hardened after thaw till in his rage
Pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea
Swallows him with his host but them lets pass
As on dry land between two crystal walls
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand
Divided till his rescued gain their shore
Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend
Though present in his Angel who shall go
Before them in a cloud and pillar of fire
By day a cloud by night a pillar of fire
To guide them in their journey and remove
Behind them while the obdurate king pursues
All night he will pursue but his approach
Darkness defends between till morning watch
Then through the fiery pillar and the cloud
God looking forth will trouble all his host
And craze their chariotwheels when by command
Moses once more his potent rod extends
Over the sea the sea his rod obeys
On their embattled ranks the waves return
And overwhelm their war  The race elect
Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance
Through the wild Desart not the readiest way
Lest entering on the Canaanite alarmed
War terrify them inexpert and fear
Return them back to Egypt choosing rather
Inglorious life with servitude for life
To noble and ignoble is more sweet
Untrained in arms where rashness leads not on
This also shall they gain by their delay
In the wide wilderness there they shall found
Their government and their great senate choose
Through the twelve tribes to rule by laws ordained
God from the mount of Sinai whose gray top
Shall tremble he descending will himself
In thunder lightning and loud trumpets sound
Ordain them laws part such as appertain
To civil justice part religious rites
Of sacrifice informing them by types
And shadows of that destined Seed to bruise
The Serpent by what means he shall achieve
Mankinds deliverance  But the voice of God
To mortal ear is dreadful  They beseech
That Moses might report to them his will
And terrour cease he grants what they besought
Instructed that to God is no access
Without Mediator whose high office now
Moses in figure bears to introduce
One greater of whose day he shall foretel
And all the Prophets in their age the times
Of great Messiah shall sing  Thus laws and rites
Established such delight hath God in Men
Obedient to his will that he vouchsafes
Among them to set up his tabernacle
The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed
Of cedar overlaid with gold therein
An ark and in the ark his testimony
The records of his covenant over these
A mercyseat of gold between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim before him burn
Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing
The heavenly fires over the tent a cloud
Shall rest by day a fiery gleam by night
Save when they journey and at length they come
Conducted by his Angel to the land
Promised to Abraham and his seedThe rest
Were long to tell how many battles fought
How many kings destroyed and kingdoms won
Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still
A day entire and nights due course adjourn
Mans voice commanding Sun in Gibeon stand
And thou moon in the vale of Aialon
Till Israel overcome so call the third
From Abraham son of Isaac and from him
His whole descent who thus shall Canaan win
Here Adam interposed  O sent from Heaven
Enlightener of my darkness gracious things
Thou hast revealed those chiefly which concern
Just Abraham and his seed now first I find
Mine eyes trueopening and my heart much eased
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become
Of me and all mankind  But now I see
His day in whom all nations shall be blest
Favour unmerited by me who sought
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means
This yet I apprehend not why to those
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth
So many and so various laws are given
So many laws argue so many sins
Among them how can God with such reside?
To whom thus Michael  Doubt not but that sin
Will reign among them as of thee begot
And therefore was law given them to evince
Their natural pravity by stirring up
Sin against law to fight that when they see
Law can discover sin but not remove
Save by those shadowy expiations weak
The blood of bulls and goats they may conclude
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man
Just for unjust that in such righteousness
To them by faith imputed they may find
Justification towards God and peace
Of conscience which the law by ceremonies
Cannot appease nor Man the mortal part
Perform and not performing cannot live
So law appears imperfect and but given
With purpose to resign them in full time
Up to a better covenant disciplined
From shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit
From imposition of strict laws to free
Acceptance of large grace from servile fear
To filial works of law to works of faith
And therefore shall not Moses though of God
Highly beloved being but the minister
Of law his people into Canaan lead
But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call
His name and office bearing who shall quell
The adversarySerpent and bring back
Through the worlds wilderness longwandered Man
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest
Mean while they in their earthly Canaan placed
Long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins
National interrupt their publick peace
Provoking God to raise them enemies
From whom as oft he saves them penitent
By Judges first then under Kings of whom
The second both for piety renowned
And puissant deeds a promise shall receive
Irrevocable that his regal throne
For ever shall endure the like shall sing
All Prophecy that of the royal stock
Of David so I name this king shall rise
A Son the Womans seed to thee foretold
Foretold to Abraham as in whom shall trust
All nations and to kings foretold of kings
The last for of his reign shall be no end
But first a long succession must ensue
And his next son for wealth and wisdom famed
The clouded ark of God till then in tents
Wandering shall in a glorious temple enshrine
Such follow him as shall be registered
Part good part bad of bad the longer scroll
Whose foul idolatries and other faults
Heaped to the popular sum will so incense
God as to leave them and expose their land
Their city his temple and his holy ark
With all his sacred things a scorn and prey
To that proud city whose high walls thou sawest
Left in confusion Babylon thence called
There in captivity he lets them dwell
The space of seventy years then brings them back
Remembering mercy and his covenant sworn
To David stablished as the days of Heaven
Returned from Babylon by leave of kings
Their lords whom God disposed the house of God
They first reedify and for a while
In mean estate live moderate till grown
In wealth and multitude factious they grow
But first among the priests dissention springs
Men who attend the altar and should most
Endeavour peace their strife pollution brings
Upon the temple itself at last they seise
The scepter and regard not Davids sons
Then lose it to a stranger that the true
Anointed King Messiah might be born
Barred of his right yet at his birth a star
Unseen before in Heaven proclaims him come
And guides the eastern sages who inquire
His place to offer incense myrrh and gold
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
To simple shepherds keeping watch by night
They gladly thither haste and by a quire
Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung
A virgin is his mother but his sire
The power of the Most High  He shall ascend
The throne hereditary and bound his reign
With Earths wide bounds his glory with the Heavens
He ceased discerning Adam with such joy
Surcharged as had like grief been dewed in tears
Without the vent of words which these he breathed
O prophet of glad tidings finisher
Of utmost hope now clear I understand
What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain
Why our great Expectation should be called
The seed of Woman  Virgin Mother hail
High in the love of Heaven yet from my loins
Thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the Son
Of God Most High so God with Man unites
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise
Expect with mortal pain  Say where and when
Their fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel
To whom thus Michael  Dream not of their fight
As of a duel or the local wounds
Of head or heel  Not therefore joins the Son
Manhood to Godhead with more strength to foil
Thy enemy nor so is overcome
Satan whose fall from Heaven a deadlier bruise
Disabled not to give thee thy deaths wound
Which he who comes thy Saviour shall recure
Not by destroying Satan but his works
In thee and in thy seed  Nor can this be
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want
Obedience to the law of God imposed
On penalty of death and suffering death
The penalty to thy transgression due
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow
So only can high Justice rest appaid
The law of God exact he shall fulfil
Both by obedience and by love though love
Alone fulfil the law thy punishment
He shall endure by coming in the flesh
To a reproachful life and cursed death
Proclaiming life to all who shall believe
In his redemption and that his obedience
Imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits
To save them not their own though legal works
For this he shall live hated be blasphemed
Seised on by force judged and to death condemned
A shameful and accursed nailed to the cross
By his own nation slain for bringing life
But to the cross he nails thy enemies
The law that is against thee and the sins
Of all mankind with him there crucified
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
In this his satisfaction so he dies
But soon revives Death over him no power
Shall long usurp ere the third dawning light
Return the stars of morn shall see him rise
Out of his grave fresh as the dawning light
Thy ransom paid which Man from death redeems
His death for Man as many as offered life
Neglect not and the benefit embrace
By faith not void of works  This Godlike act
Annuls thy doom the death thou shouldest have died
In sin for ever lost from life this act
Shall bruise the head of Satan crush his strength
Defeating Sin and Death his two main arms
And fix far deeper in his head their stings
Than temporal death shall bruise the victors heel
Or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep
A gentle wafting to immortal life
Nor after resurrection shall he stay
Longer on earth than certain times to appear
To his disciples men who in his life
Still followed him to them shall leave in charge
To teach all nations what of him they learned
And his salvation them who shall believe
Baptizing in the profluent stream the sign
Of washing them from guilt of sin to life
Pure and in mind prepared if so befall
For death like that which the Redeemer died
All nations they shall teach for from that day
