Ivory Coast Economy

Overview
    Ivory Coast is among the worlds largest producers and exporters of coffee
    cocoa beans and palmkernel oil Consequently the economy is highly
    sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and cocoa and
    to weather conditions Despite attempts by the government to diversify the
    economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related industries
    The agricultural sector accounts for over onethird of GDP and about  of
    export earnings and employs about  of the labor force A collapse of
    world cocoa and coffee prices in  threw the economy into a recession
    from which the country had not recovered by  Continuing poor prices for
    commodity exports an overvalued exchange rate a bloated publicsector wage
    bill and a large foreign debt hindered economic recovery in
