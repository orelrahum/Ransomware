Switzerland Economy

    Switzerlands economic success is matched in few other nations Per capita
    output general living standards education and science health care and
    diet are unsurpassed in Europe Economic stability helps promote the
    important banking and tourist sectors Since World War II Switzerlands
    economy has adjusted smoothly to the great changes in output and trade
    patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust to the challenges of the s
    particularly to the further economic integration of Western Europe and the
    amazingly rapid changes in East European political and economic prospects
    After  years of growth the economy experienced a mild recession in 
    because monetary policy was tightened to combat inflation and because of the
    weak international economy In the second half of  however Switzerland
    is expected to resume growth despite inflation and unemployment problems
    GDP growth for  may be just under  inflation should drop from  to
     and the trade deficit will continue to decline after dropping by over
     to  billion due to increased exports to Germany Unemployment

Syria Economy

Overview
    Syrias statedominated Bathist economy has benefited from the Gulf war
    increased oil production good weather and economic deregulation Economic
    growth averaged nearly  annually in  buoyed by increased oil
    production and improved agricultural performance The Gulf war of early 
    provided Syria an aid windfall of several billion dollars from Arab
    European and Japanese donors These inflows more than offset Damascuss
    warrelated costs and will help Syria cover some of its debt arrears
    restore suspended credit lines and initiate selected military and civilian
    purchases For the long run Syrias economy is still saddled with a large
    number of poorly performing public sector firms investment levels remain
    low and industrial and agricultural productivity is poor A major longterm
    concern is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when
    its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed by middecade
