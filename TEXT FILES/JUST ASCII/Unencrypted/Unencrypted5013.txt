United I beheld no fair to thine
Equivalent or second which compelled
Me thus though importune perhaps to come
And gaze and worship thee of right declared
Sovran of creatures universal Dame
So talked the spirited sly Snake and Eve
Yet more amazed unwary thus replied
Serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt
The virtue of that fruit in thee first proved
But say where grows the tree? from hence how far?
For many are the trees of God that grow
In Paradise and various yet unknown
To us in such abundance lies our choice
As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched
Still hanging incorruptible till men
Grow up to their provision and more hands
Help to disburden Nature of her birth
To whom the wily Adder blithe and glad
Empress the way is ready and not long
Beyond a row of myrtles on a flat
Fast by a fountain one small thicket past
Of blowing myrrh and balm if thou accept
My conduct I can bring thee thither soon
Lead then said Eve  He leading swiftly rolled
In tangles and made intricate seem straight
To mischief swift  Hope elevates and joy
Brightens his crest as when a wandering fire
Compact of unctuous vapour which the night
Condenses and the cold environs round
Kindled through agitation to a flame
Which oft they say some evil Spirit attends
Hovering and blazing with delusive light
Misleads the amazed nightwanderer from his way
To bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool
There swallowed up and lost from succour far
So glistered the dire Snake and into fraud
Led Eve our credulous mother to the tree
Of prohibition root of all our woe
Which when she saw thus to her guide she spake
Serpent we might have spared our coming hither
Fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess
The credit of whose virtue rest with thee
Wonderous indeed if cause of such effects
But of this tree we may not taste nor touch
God so commanded and left that command
Sole daughter of his voice the rest we live
Law to ourselves our reason is our law
To whom the Tempter guilefully replied
Indeed hath God then said that of the fruit
Of all these gardentrees ye shall not eat
Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air?
To whom thus Eve yet sinless  Of the fruit
Of each tree in the garden we may eat
But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
The garden God hath said Ye shall not eat
Thereof nor shall ye touch it lest ye die
She scarce had said though brief when now more bold
The Tempter but with show of zeal and love
To Man and indignation at his wrong
New part puts on and as to passion moved
Fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act
Raised as of some great matter to begin
As when of old some orator renowned
In Athens or free Rome where eloquence
Flourished since mute to some great cause addressed
Stood in himself collected while each part
Motion each act won audience ere the tongue
Sometimes in highth began as no delay
Of preface brooking through his zeal of right
So standing moving or to highth up grown
The Tempter all impassioned thus began
O sacred wise and wisdomgiving Plant
Mother of science now I feel thy power
Within me clear not only to discern
Things in their causes but to trace the ways
Of highest agents deemed however wise
Queen of this universe do not believe
Those rigid threats of death ye shall not die
How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life
To knowledge by the threatener? look on me
Me who have touched and tasted yet both live
And life more perfect have attained than Fate
Meant me by venturing higher than my lot
Shall that be shut to Man which to the Beast
Is open? or will God incense his ire
For such a petty trespass? and not praise
Rather your dauntless virtue whom the pain
Of death denounced whatever thing death be
Deterred not from achieving what might lead
To happier life knowledge of good and evil
Of good how just? of evil if what is evil
Be real why not known since easier shunned?
God therefore cannot hurt ye and be just
Not just not God not feared then nor obeyed
Your fear itself of death removes the fear
Why then was this forbid?  Why but to awe
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant
His worshippers?  He knows that in the day
Ye eat thereof your eyes that seem so clear
Yet are but dim shall perfectly be then
Opened and cleared and ye shall be as Gods
Knowing both good and evil as they know
That ye shall be as Gods since I as Man
Internal Man is but proportion meet
I of brute human ye of human Gods
So ye shall die perhaps by putting off
Human to put on Gods death to be wished
Though threatened which no worse than this can bring
And what are Gods that Man may not become
As they participating Godlike food?
The Gods are first and that advantage use
On our belief that all from them proceeds
I question it for this fair earth I see
Warmed by the sun producing every kind
Them nothing if they all things who enclosed
Knowledge of good and evil in this tree
That whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies
The offence that Man should thus attain to know?
What can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
Impart against his will if all be his?
Or is it envy? and can envy dwell
In heavenly breasts?  These these and many more
Causes import your need of this fair fruit
Goddess humane reach then and freely taste
He ended and his words replete with guile
Into her heart too easy entrance won
Fixed on the fruit she gazed which to behold
Might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
Yet rung of his persuasive words impregned
With reason to her seeming and with truth
Mean while the hour of noon drew on and waked
An eager appetite raised by the smell
So savoury of that fruit which with desire
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste
Solicited her longing eye yet first
Pausing a while thus to herself she mused
Great are thy virtues doubtless best of fruits
Though kept from man and worthy to be admired
Whose taste too long forborn at first assay
Gave elocution to the mute and taught
The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise
Thy praise he also who forbids thy use
Conceals not from us naming thee the tree
Of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil
Forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
Commends thee more while it infers the good
By thee communicated and our want
For good unknown sure is not had or had
And yet unknown is as not had at all
In plain then what forbids he but to know
Forbids us good forbids us to be wise?
Such prohibitions bind not  But if death
Bind us with afterbands what profits then
Our inward freedom?  In the day we eat
Of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die
How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives
And knows and speaks and reasons and discerns
Irrational till then  For us alone
Was death invented? or to us denied
This intellectual food for beasts reserved?
For beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
Hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
The good befallen him author unsuspect
Friendly to man far from deceit or guile
What fear I then? rather what know to fear
Under this ignorance of good and evil
Of God or death of law or penalty?
Here grows the cure of all this fruit divine
Fair to the eye inviting to the taste
Of virtue to make wise  What hinders then
To reach and feed at once both body and mind?
So saying her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the fruit she plucked she eat
Earth felt the wound and Nature from her seat
Sighing through all her works gave signs of woe
That all was lost  Back to the thicket slunk
The guilty Serpent and well mightfor Eve
Intent now wholly on her taste nought else
Regarded such delight till then as seemed
In fruit she never tasted whether true
Or fancied so through expectation high
Of knowledge not was Godhead from her thought
Greedily she ingorged without restraint
And knew not eating death  Satiate at length
And hightened as with wine jocund and boon
Thus to herself she pleasingly began
O sovran virtuous precious of all trees
In Paradise of operation blest
To sapience hitherto obscured infamed
And thy fair fruit let hang as to no end
Created but henceforth my early care
Not without song each morning and due praise
Shall tend thee and the fertile burden ease
Of thy full branches offered free to all
Till dieted by thee I grow mature
In knowledge as the Gods who all things know
Though others envy what they cannot give
For had the gift been theirs it had not here
Thus grown  Experience next to thee I owe
Best guide not following thee I had remained
In ignorance thou openest wisdoms way
And givest access though secret she retire
And I perhaps am secret Heaven is high
High and remote to see from thence distinct
Each thing on Earth and other care perhaps
May have diverted from continual watch
Our great Forbidder safe with all his spies
About him  But to Adam in what sort
Shall I appear? shall I to him make known
As yet my change and give him to partake
Full happiness with me or rather not
But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power
Without copartner? so to add what wants
In female sex the more to draw his love
And render me more equal and perhaps
A thing not undesirable sometime
Superiour for inferiour who is free
This may be well  But what if God have seen
And death ensue? then I shall be no more
And Adam wedded to another Eve
Shall live with her enjoying I extinct
A death to think  Confirmed then I resolve
Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe
So dear I love him that with him all deaths
I could endure without him live no life
So saying from the tree her step she turned
But first low reverence done as to the Power
That dwelt within whose presence had infused
Into the plant sciential sap derived
From nectar drink of Gods  Adam the while
Waiting desirous her return had wove
Of choicest flowers a garland to adorn
Her tresses and her rural labours crown
As reapers oft are wont their harvestqueen
Great joy he promised to his thoughts and new
Solace in her return so long delayed
Yet oft his heart divine of something ill
Misgave him he the faltering measure felt
And forth to meet her went the way she took
That morn when first they parted by the tree
Of knowledge he must pass there he her met
Scarce from the tree returning in her hand
A bough of fairest fruit that downy smiled
New gathered and ambrosial smell diffused
To him she hasted in her face excuse
Came prologue and apology too prompt
Which with bland words at will she thus addressed
Hast thou not wondered Adam at my stay?
Thee I have missed and thought it long deprived
Thy presence agony of love till now
Not felt nor shall be twice for never more
Mean I to try what rash untried I sought
The pain of absence from thy sight  But strange
Hath been the cause and wonderful to hear
This tree is not as we are told a tree
Of danger tasted nor to evil unknown
Opening the way but of divine effect
To open eyes and make them Gods who taste
And hath been tasted such  The serpent wise
Or not restrained as we or not obeying
Hath eaten of the fruit and is become
Not dead as we are threatened but thenceforth
Endued with human voice and human sense
Reasoning to admiration and with me
Persuasively hath so prevailed that I
Have also tasted and have also found
The effects to correspond opener mine eyes
Dim erst dilated spirits ampler heart
And growing up to Godhead which for thee
Chiefly I sought without thee can despise
For bliss as thou hast part to me is bliss
Tedious unshared with thee and odious soon
Thou therefore also taste that equal lot
May join us equal joy as equal love
Lest thou not tasting different degree
Disjoin us and I then too late renounce
Deity for thee when Fate will not permit
Thus Eve with countenance blithe her story told
But in her cheek distemper flushing glowed
On the other side Adam soon as he heard
The fatal trespass done by Eve amazed
Astonied stood and blank while horrour chill
Ran through his veins and all his joints relaxed
From his slack hand the garland wreathed for Eve
Down dropt and all the faded roses shed
Speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
First to himself he inward silence broke
O fairest of Creation last and best
Of all Gods works Creature in whom excelled
Whatever can to sight or thought be formed
Holy divine good amiable or sweet
How art thou lost how on a sudden lost
Defaced deflowered and now to death devote
Rather how hast thou yielded to transgress
The strict forbiddance how to violate
The sacred fruit forbidden  Some cursed fraud
Of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown
And me with thee hath ruined for with thee
Certain my resolution is to die
How can I live without thee how forego
Thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined
To live again in these wild woods forlorn
Should God create another Eve and I
Another rib afford yet loss of thee
Would never from my heart no noI feel
The link of Nature draw me flesh of flesh
Bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
Mine never shall be parted bliss or woe
So having said as one from sad dismay
Recomforted and after thoughts disturbed
Submitting to what seemed remediless
Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned
Bold deed thou hast presumed adventurous Eve
And peril great provoked who thus hast dared
Had it been only coveting to eye
That sacred fruit sacred to abstinence
Much more to taste it under ban to touch
But past who can recall or done undo?
Not God Omnipotent nor Fate yet so
Perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
Is not so heinous now foretasted fruit
Profaned first by the serpent by him first
Made common and unhallowed ere our taste
Nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives
Lives as thou saidst and gains to live as Man
Higher degree of life inducement strong
To us as likely tasting to attain
Proportional ascent which cannot be
But to be Gods or Angels demiGods
Nor can I think that God Creator wise
Though threatening will in earnest so destroy
Us his prime creatures dignified so high
Set over all his works which in our fall
For us created needs with us must fail
Dependant made so God shall uncreate
Be frustrate do undo and labour lose
Not well conceived of God who though his power
Creation could repeat yet would be loth
Us to abolish lest the Adversary
Triumph and say "Fickle their state whom God
"Most favours who can please him long? Me first
"He ruined now Mankind whom will he next?"
Matter of scorn not to be given the Foe
However I with thee have fixed my lot
Certain to undergo like doom  If death
Consort with thee death is to me as life
So forcible within my heart I feel
The bond of Nature draw me to my own
My own in thee for what thou art is mine
Our state cannot be severed we are one
One flesh to lose thee were to lose myself
So Adam and thus Eve to him replied
O glorious trial of exceeding love
Illustrious evidence example high
Engaging me to emulate but short
Of thy perfection how shall I attain
Adam from whose dear side I boast me sprung
And gladly of our union hear thee speak
One heart one soul in both whereof good proof
This day affords declaring thee resolved
Rather than death or aught than death more dread
Shall separate us linked in love so dear
To undergo with me one guilt one crime
If any be of tasting this fair fruit
Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds
Direct or by occasion hath presented
This happy trial of thy love which else
So eminently never had been known?
Were it I thought death menaced would ensue
This my attempt I would sustain alone
The worst and not persuade thee rather die
Deserted than oblige thee with a fact
Pernicious to thy peace chiefly assured
Remarkably so late of thy so true
So faithful love unequalled but I feel
Far otherwise the event not death but life
Augmented opened eyes new hopes new joys
Taste so divine that what of sweet before
Hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh
On my experience Adam freely taste
And fear of death deliver to the winds
So saying she embraced him and for joy
Tenderly wept much won that he his love
Had so ennobled as of choice to incur
Divine displeasure for her sake or death
In recompence for such compliance bad
Such recompence best merits from the bough
She gave him of that fair enticing fruit
With liberal hand he scrupled not to eat
Against his better knowledge not deceived
But fondly overcome with female charm
Earth trembled from her entrails as again
In pangs and Nature gave a second groan
Sky loured and muttering thunder some sad drops
Wept at completing of the mortal sin
Original while Adam took no thought
Eating his fill nor Eve to iterate
Her former trespass feared the more to sooth
Him with her loved society that now
As with new wine intoxicated both
They swim in mirth and fancy that they feel
Divinity within them breeding wings
Wherewith to scorn the earth  But that false fruit
Far other operation first displayed
Carnal desire inflaming he on Eve
Began to cast lascivious eyes she him
As wantonly repaid in lust they burn
Till Adam thus gan Eve to dalliance move
Eve now I see thou art exact of taste
And elegant of sapience no small part
Since to each meaning savour we apply
And palate call judicious I the praise
Yield thee so well this day thou hast purveyed
Much pleasure we have lost while we abstained
From this delightful fruit nor known till now
True relish tasting if such pleasure be
In things to us forbidden it might be wished
For this one tree had been forbidden ten
But come so well refreshed now let us play
As meet is after such delicious fare
For never did thy beauty since the day
I saw thee first and wedded thee adorned
With all perfections so inflame my sense
With ardour to enjoy thee fairer now
Than ever bounty of this virtuous tree
So said he and forbore not glance or toy
Of amorous intent well understood
Of Eve whose eye darted contagious fire
Her hand he seised and to a shady bank
Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowered
He led her nothing loth flowers were the couch
Pansies and violets and asphodel
And hyacinth  Earths freshest softest lap
There they their fill of love and loves disport
Took largely of their mutual guilt the seal
The solace of their sin till dewy sleep
Oppressed them wearied with their amorous play
Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit
That with exhilarating vapour bland
About their spirits had played and inmost powers
Made err was now exhaled and grosser sleep
Bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
Incumbered now had left them up they rose
As from unrest and each the other viewing
Soon found their eyes how opened and their minds
How darkened innocence that as a veil
Had shadowed them from knowing ill was gone
Just confidence and native righteousness
And honour from about them naked left
To guilty Shame he covered but his robe
Uncovered more  So rose the Danite strong
Herculean Samson from the harlotlap
Of Philistean Dalilah and waked
Shorn of his strength  They destitute and bare
Of all their virtue  Silent and in face
Confounded long they sat as strucken mute
Till Adam though not less than Eve abashed
At length gave utterance to these words constrained
O Eve in evil hour thou didst give ear
To that false worm of whomsoever taught
To counterfeit Mans voice true in our fall
False in our promised rising since our eyes
Opened we find indeed and find we know
Both good and evil good lost and evil got
Bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know
Which leaves us naked thus of honour void
Of innocence of faith of purity
Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained
And in our faces evident the signs
Of foul concupiscence whence evil store
Even shame the last of evils of the first
Be sure thenHow shall I behold the face
Henceforth of God or Angel erst with joy
And rapture so oft beheld?  Those heavenly shapes
Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze
Insufferably bright  O might I here
In solitude live savage in some glade
Obscured where highest woods impenetrable
To star or sunlight spread their umbrage broad
And brown as evening  Cover me ye Pines
Ye Cedars with innumerable boughs
Hide me where I may never see them more
But let us now as in bad plight devise
What best may for the present serve to hide
The parts of each from other that seem most
To shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen
Some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sewed
And girded on our loins may cover round
Those middle parts that this new comer Shame
There sit not and reproach us as unclean
So counselled he and both together went
Into the thickest wood there soon they chose
The figtree not that kind for fruit renowned
But such as at this day to Indians known
In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms
Branching so broad and long that in the ground
The bended twigs take root and daughters grow
About the mother tree a pillared shade
High overarched and echoing walks between
There oft the Indian herdsman shunning heat
Shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds
At loopholes cut through thickest shade  Those leaves
They gathered broad as Amazonian targe
And with what skill they had together sewed
To gird their waist vain covering if to hide
Their guilt and dreaded shame  O how unlike
To that first naked glory  Such of late
Columbus found the American so girt
With feathered cincture naked else and wild
Among the trees on isles and woody shores
Thus fenced and as they thought their shame in part
Covered but not at rest or ease of mind
They sat them down to weep nor only tears
Rained at their eyes but high winds worse within
Began to rise high passions anger hate
Mistrust suspicion discord and shook sore
Their inward state of mind calm region once
And full of peace now tost and turbulent
For Understanding ruled not and the Will
Heard not her lore both in subjection now
To sensual Appetite who from beneath
Usurping over sovran Reason claimed
Superiour sway From thus distempered breast
Adam estranged in look and altered style
Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed
Would thou hadst hearkened to my words and staid
With me as I besought thee when that strange
Desire of wandering this unhappy morn
I know not whence possessed thee we had then
Remained still happy not as now despoiled
Of all our good shamed naked miserable
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
The faith they owe when earnestly they seek
Such proof conclude they then begin to fail
To whom soon moved with touch of blame thus Eve
What words have passed thy lips Adam severe
Imputest thou that to my default or will
Of wandering as thou callest it which who knows
But might as ill have happened thou being by
Or to thyself perhaps?  Hadst thou been there
Or here the attempt thou couldst not have discerned
Fraud in the Serpent speaking as he spake
No ground of enmity between us known
Why he should mean me ill or seek to harm
Was I to have never parted from thy side?
As good have grown there still a lifeless rib
Being as I am why didst not thou the head
Command me absolutely not to go
Going into such danger as thou saidst?
Too facile then thou didst not much gainsay
Nay didst permit approve and fair dismiss
Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent
Neither had I transgressed nor thou with me
To whom then first incensed Adam replied
Is this the love is this the recompence
Of mine to thee ingrateful Eve expressed
Immutable when thou wert lost not I
Who might have lived and joyed immortal bliss
Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?
And am I now upbraided as the cause
Of thy transgressing?  Not enough severe
It seems in thy restraint  What could I more
I warned thee I admonished thee foretold
The danger and the lurking enemy
That lay in wait beyond this had been force
And force upon free will hath here no place
But confidence then bore thee on secure
Either to meet no danger or to find
Matter of glorious trial and perhaps
I also erred in overmuch admiring
What seemed in thee so perfect that I thought
No evil durst attempt thee but I rue
The errour now which is become my crime
And thou the accuser  Thus it shall befall
Him who to worth in women overtrusting
Lets her will rule restraint she will not brook
And left to herself if evil thence ensue
She first his weak indulgence will accuse
Thus they in mutual accusation spent
The fruitless hours but neither selfcondemning
