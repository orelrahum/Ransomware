Colombia Economy

Overview
    Economic development has slowed gradually since  but growth rates
    remain high by Latin American standards Conservative economic policies have
    kept inflation and unemployment near  and  respectively The rapid
    development of oil coal and other nontraditional industries over the past
    four years has helped to offset the decline in coffee prices  Colombias
    major export The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in the
    summer of  a troublesome rural insurgency and drugrelated violence
    have dampened growth but significant economic reforms are likely to
    facilitate a resurgent economy in the medium term These reforms center on
    fiscal restraint trade liberalization and privatization of state utilities
    and commercial banks
