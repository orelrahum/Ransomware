    retained the economic policies of the previous government keeping inflation
    down and continuing moderate growth Nevertheless Bolivia continues to be
    one of the poorest countries in Latin America with widespread poverty and
    unemployment and it remains vulnerable to price fluctuations for its
    limited exports  agricultural products minerals and natural gas
    Moreover for many farmers who constitute half of the countrys work force
    the main cash crop is coca which is sold for cocaine processing

Bosnia and Herzegovina Economy

Overview
    Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest component in
    the old Yugoslav federation Although agriculture has been almost all in
    private hands farms have been small and inefficient and the republic
    traditionally has been a net importer of food Industry has been greatly
    overstaffed one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning
    and management Tito had pushed the development of military industries in
    the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of
    Yugoslavias defense plants As of April  the newly independent
    republic was being torn apart by bitter interethnic warfare that has caused
    production to plummet unemployment and inflation to soar and human misery
    to multiply The survival of the republic as a political and economic unit
    is in doubt Both Serbia and Croatia have imposed various economic blockades
    and may permanently take over large areas populated by fellow ethnic groups
    These areas contain most of the industry If a much smaller core Muslim
    state survives it will share many Third World problems of poverty
    technological backwardness and dependence on historically soft foreign
    markets for its primary products In these circumstances other Muslim
    countries might offer assistance

Botswana Economy

Overview
    The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops
    Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than  of the population
    but produces only about  of food needs The driving force behind the
    rapid economic growth of the s and s has been the mining industry
    This sector mostly on the strength of diamonds has gone from generating
     of GDP in  to over  in  No other sector has experienced such
    growth especially not agriculture which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
    poor soils The unemployment rate remains a problem at  Although diamond
    production remained level in FY substantial gains in coal output and
    manufacturing helped boost the economy
