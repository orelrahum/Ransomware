Austria Economy

Overview
    Austria boasts a prosperous and stable capitalist economy with a sizable
    proportion of nationalized industry and extensive welfare benefits Thanks
    to an excellent raw material endowment a technically skilled labor force
    and strong links to German industrial firms Austria occupies specialized
    niches in European industry and services tourism banking and produces
    almost enough food to feed itself with only  of the labor force in
    agriculture Improved export prospects resulting from German unification and
    the opening of Eastern Europe boosted the economy during  and to a
    lesser extent in  GDP growth slowed from  in  to  in  
    mainly due to the weaker world economy  and is expected to drop to around
     in  Inflation is forecasted at about  while unemployment probably
    will increase moderately through  before declining in  Living
    standards are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western
    Europe Problems for the ls include an aging population the high level
    of subsidies and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budget
    capabilities Austria which has applied for EC membership was involved in
    EC and European Free Trade Association negotiations for a European Economic
    Area and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer interchange of
    goods services capital and labor within the EC
