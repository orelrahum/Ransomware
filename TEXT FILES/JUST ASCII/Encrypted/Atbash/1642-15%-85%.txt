	melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs
	More I prithee more

AMIENS	My voice is ragged I know I cannot please you

JAQUES	I do not desire you to please me I do desire you to
	sing Come more another stanzo call you em stanzos?

AMIENS	What you will Monsieur Jaques

JAQUES	Nay I care not for their names they owe me
	nothing Will you sing?

AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself

JAQUES	Well then if ever I thank any man Ill thank you
	but that they call compliment is like the encounter
	of two dogapes and when a man thanks me heartily
	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
	the beggarly thanks Come sing and you that will
	not hold your tongues

AMIENS	Well Ill end the song Sirs cover the while the
	duke will drink under this tree He hath been all
	this day to look you

JAQUES	And I have been all this day to avoid him He is
	too disputable for my company I think of as many
	matters as he but I give heaven thanks and make no
	boast of them Come warble come

	SONG
	Who doth ambition shun

	All together here

	And loves to live i the sun
	Seeking the food he eats
	And pleased with what he gets
	Come hither come hither come hither
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather

JAQUES	Ill give you a verse to this note that I made
	yesterday in despite of my invention

AMIENS	And Ill sing it

JAQUES	Thus it goes

	If it do come to pass
	That any man turn ass
	Leaving his wealth and ease
	A stubborn will to please
	Ducdame ducdame ducdame
	Here shall he see
	Gross fools as he
	An if he will come to me

AMIENS	Whats that ducdame?

JAQUES	Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a
	circle Ill go sleep if I can if I cannot Ill
	rail against all the firstborn of Egypt

AMIENS	And Ill go seek the duke his banquet is prepared

	Exeunt severally

SCENE VII	The forest


	A table set out Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and
	Lords like outlaws

DUKE SENIOR	I think he be transformd into a beast
	For I can no where find him like a man

First Lord	My lord he is but even now gone hence
	Here was he merry hearing of a song

DUKE SENIOR	If he compact of jars grow musical
	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres
	Go seek him tell him I would speak with him

	Enter JAQUES

First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach

DUKE SENIOR	Why how now monsieur what a life is this
	That your poor friends must woo your company?
	What you look merrily

JAQUES	A fool a fool I met a fool i the forest
	A motley fool a miserable world
	As I do live by food I met a fool
	Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun
	And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms
	In good set terms and yet a motley fool
	Good morrow fool quoth I No sir quoth he
	Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
	And then he drew a dial from his poke
	And looking on it with lacklustre eye
	Says very wisely It is ten oclock
	Thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
