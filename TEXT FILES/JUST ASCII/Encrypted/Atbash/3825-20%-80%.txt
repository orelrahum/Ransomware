Japan Economy

Overview
    Governmentindustry cooperation a strong work ethic and a comparatively
    small defense allocation have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
    rapidity notably in hightechnology fields Industry the most important
    sector of the economy is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
    fuels Selfsufficent in rice Japan must import  of its requirements for
    other grain and fodder crops Japan maintains one of the worlds largest
    fishing fleets and accounts for nearly  of the global catch Overall
    economic growth has been spectacular a  average in the s a 
    average in the s and s A major contributor to overall growth of
     in  was net exports which cushioned the effect of slower growth in
    domestic demand Inflation remains low at  and is easing due to lower
    oil prices and a stronger yen Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus
     billion in  which supports extensive investment in foreign assets
    The increased crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its
    population are two major longrun problems
