ROSALIND	Is it a man?

CELIA	And a chain that you once wore about his neck
	Change you colour?

ROSALIND	I prithee who?

CELIA	O Lord Lord it is a hard matter for friends to
	meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
	and so encounter

ROSALIND	Nay but who is it?

CELIA	Is it possible?

ROSALIND	Nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence
	tell me who it is

CELIA	O wonderful wonderful and most wonderful
	wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that
	out of all hooping

ROSALIND	Good my complexion dost thou think though I am
	caparisoned like a man I have a doublet and hose in
	my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
	Southsea of discovery I prithee tell me who is it
	quickly and speak apace I would thou couldst
	stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man
	out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow
	mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at
	all I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that
	may drink thy tidings

CELIA	So you may put a man in your belly

ROSALIND	Is he of Gods making? What manner of man? Is his
	head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?

CELIA	Nay he hath but a little beard

ROSALIND	Why God will send more if the man will be
	thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if
	thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin

CELIA	It is young Orlando that tripped up the wrestlers
	heels and your heart both in an instant

ROSALIND	Nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and
	true maid

CELIA	I faith coz tis he

ROSALIND	Orlando?

CELIA	Orlando

ROSALIND	Alas the day what shall I do with my doublet and
	hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
	he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
	him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
	How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
	him again? Answer me in one word

CELIA	You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first tis a
	word too great for any mouth of this ages size To
	say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
	answer in a catechism

ROSALIND	But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
	mans apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
	day he wrestled?

CELIA	It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
	propositions of a lover but take a taste of my
	finding him and relish it with good observance
	I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn

ROSALIND	It may well be called Joves tree when it drops
	forth such fruit

CELIA	Give me audience good madam

ROSALIND	Proceed

CELIA	There lay he stretched along like a wounded knight

ROSALIND	Though it be pity to see such a sight it well
	becomes the ground

CELIA	Cry holla to thy tongue I prithee it curvets
	unseasonably He was furnished like a hunter

ROSALIND	O ominous he comes to kill my heart

CELIA	I would sing my song without a burden thou bringest
	me out of tune

ROSALIND	Do you not know I am a woman? when I think I must
	speak Sweet say on

CELIA	You bring me out Soft comes he not here?

	Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES

ROSALIND	Tis he slink by and note him

JAQUES	I thank you for your company but good faith I had
	as lief have been myself alone

ORLANDO	And so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you
	too for your society

JAQUES	God be wi you lets meet as little as we can

ORLANDO	I do desire we may be better strangers

JAQUES	I pray you mar no more trees with writing
	lovesongs in their barks

ORLANDO	I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading
	them illfavouredly

JAQUES	Rosalind is your loves name?

ORLANDO	Yes just

JAQUES	I do not like her name

ORLANDO	There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
	christened

JAQUES	What stature is she of?

ORLANDO	Just as high as my heart

JAQUES	You are full of pretty answers Have you not been
	acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them
	out of rings?

ORLANDO	Not so but I answer you right painted cloth from
	whence you have studied your questions

JAQUES	You have a nimble wit I think twas made of
	Atalantas heels Will you sit down with me? and
	we two will rail against our mistress the world and
	all our misery

ORLANDO	I will chide no breather in the world but myself
	against whom I know most faults

JAQUES	The worst fault you have is to be in love

ORLANDO	Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue
	I am weary of you

JAQUES	By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found
	you

ORLANDO	He is drowned in the brook look but in and you
	shall see him

JAQUES	There I shall see mine own figure

ORLANDO	Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher

JAQUES	Ill tarry no longer with you farewell good
	Signior Love

ORLANDO	I am glad of your departure adieu good Monsieur
	Melancholy

	Exit JAQUES

ROSALIND	Aside to CELIA  I will speak to him like a saucy
	lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
	Do you hear forester?

ORLANDO	Very well what would you?

ROSALIND	I pray you what ist oclock?

ORLANDO	You should ask me what time o day theres no clock
	in the forest

ROSALIND	Then there is no true lover in the forest else
	sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
	detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock

ORLANDO	And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
	been as proper?

ROSALIND	By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with
	divers persons Ill tell you who Time ambles
	withal who Time trots withal who Time gallops
	withal and who he stands still withal

ORLANDO	I prithee who doth he trot withal?

ROSALIND	Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
	contract of her marriage and the day it is
	solemnized if the interim be but a sennight
	Times pace is so hard that it seems the length of
	seven year

ORLANDO	Who ambles Time withal?

ROSALIND	With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
	hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because
	he cannot study and the other lives merrily because
	he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean
	and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden
	of heavy tedious penury these Time ambles withal

ORLANDO	Who doth he gallop withal?

ROSALIND	With a thief to the gallows for though he go as
	softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there

ORLANDO	Who stays it still withal?

ROSALIND	With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between
	term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves

ORLANDO	Where dwell you pretty youth?

ROSALIND	With this shepherdess my sister here in the
	skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petGRXLZG
