Of middle age one rising eminent
In wise deport spake much of right and wrong
Of justice or religion truth and peace
And judgement from above him old and young
Exploded and had seized with violent hands
Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
Unseen amid the throng so violence
Proceeded and oppression and swordlaw
Through all the plain and refuge none was found
Adam was all in tears and to his guide
Lamenting turned full sad Owhat are these
Deaths ministers not men? who thus deal death
Inhumanly to men and multiply
Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
His brother for of whom such massacre
Make they but of their brethren men of men
But who was that just man whom had not Heaven
Rescued had in his righteouHMVHH YVVM OLHG?
