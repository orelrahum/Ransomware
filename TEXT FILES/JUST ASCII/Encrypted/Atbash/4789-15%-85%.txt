    a livelihood even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers
    were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the s and s
    Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore which account for almost 
    of total exports The decline in world demand for this ore however has led
    to cutbacks in production The nations coastal waters are among the richest
    fishing areas in the world but overexploitation by foreigners threatens
    this key source of revenue The countrys first deepwater port opened near
    Nouakchott in  In recent years the droughts the endemic conflict with
    Senegal rising energy costs and economic mismanagement have resulted in a
    substantial buildup of foreign debt The government has begun the second
    stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank the
    IMF and major donor countries But the reform process suffered a major
    setback following the Gulf war of early  Because of Mauritanias
    support of Saddam Husayn bilateral aid from its two top donors Saudi
    Arabia and Kuwait was suspended and multilateral aid was reduced
