  We had the best of educationsin fact we went to school
every day

  IVE been to a dayschool too said Alice you neednt be
so proud as all that

  With extras? asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously

  Yes said Alice we learned French and music

  And washing? said the Mock Turtle

  Certainly not said Alice indignantly

  Ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the Mock
Turtle in a tone of great relief  Now at OURS they had at the
end of the bill "French music AND WASHINGextra"

  You couldnt have wanted it much said Alice living at the
bottom of the sea

  I couldnt afford to learn it said the Mock Turtle with a
sigh  I only took the regular course

  What was that? inquired Alice

  Reeling and Writhing of course to begin with the Mock
Turtle replied and then the different branches of Arithmetic
Ambition Distraction Uglification and Derision

  I never heard of "Uglification" Alice ventured to say  What
is it?

  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise  What  Never
heard of uglifying it exclaimed  You know what to beautify
is I suppose?

  Yes said Alice doubtfully  it meanstomakeanything
prettier

  Well then the Gryphon went on if you dont know what to
uglify is you ARE a simpleton

  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about
it so she turned to the Mock Turtle and said What else had you
to learn?

  Well there was Mystery the Mock Turtle replied counting
off the subjects on his flappers Mystery ancient and modern
with Seaography  then Drawlingthe Drawlingmaster was an old
congereel that used to come once a week  HE taught us
Drawling Stretching and Fainting in Coils

  What was THAT like? said Alice

  Well I cant show it you myself the Mock Turtle said  Im
too stiff  And the Gryphon never learnt it

  Hadnt time said the Gryphon  I went to the Classics
master though  He was an old crab HE was

  I never went to him the Mock Turtle said with a sigh  he
taught Laughing and Grief they used to say

  So he did so he did said the Gryphon sighing in his turn
and both creatures hid their faces in their paws

  And how many hours a day did you do lessons? said Alice in a
hurry to change the subject

  Ten hours the first day said the Mock Turtle nine the
next and so on

  What a curious plan exclaimed Alice

  Thats the reason theyre called lessons the Gryphon
remarked  because they lessen from day to day

  This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a
little before she made her next remark  Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday?

  Of course it was said the Mock Turtle

  And how did you manage on the twelfth? Alice went on eagerly

  Thats enough about lessons the Gryphon interrupted in a
very decided tone  tell her something about the games now



                            CHAPTER X

                      The Lobster Quadrille


  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper
across his eyes  He looked at Alice and tried to speak but for
a minute or two sobs choked his voice  Same as if he had a bone
in his throat said the Gryphon  and it set to work shaking him
and punching him in the back  At last the Mock Turtle recovered
his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on
again

  You may not have lived much under the sea I havent
said Aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster
Alice began to say I once tasted but checked herself hastily
and said No never so you can have no idea what a delightful
thing a Lobster Quadrille is

  No indeed said Alice  What sort of a dance is it?

  Why said the Gryphon you first form into a line along the
seashore

  Two lines cried the Mock Turtle  Seals turtles salmon
and so on then when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of
the way

  THAT generally takes some time interrupted the Gryphon

  you advance twice

  Each with a lobster as a partner cried the Gryphon

  Of course the Mock Turtle said  advance twice set to
partners

  change lobsters and retire in same order continued the
Gryphon

  Then you know the Mock Turtle went on you throw the

  The lobsters shouted the Gryphon with a bound into the air

  as far out to sea as you can

  Swim after them screamed the Gryphon

  Turn a somersault in the sea cried the Mock Turtle
capering wildly about

  Back to land again and thats all the first figure said the
Mock Turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures
who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat
down again very sadly and quietly and looked at Alice

  It must be a very pretty dance said Alice timidly

  Would you like to see a little of it? said the Mock Turtle

  Very much indeed said Alice

  Come lets try the first figure said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon  We can do without lobsters you know  Which shall
sing?

  Oh YOU sing said the Gryphon  Ive forgotten the words

  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice every now
and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and
waving their forepaws to mark the time while the Mock Turtle
sang this very slowly and sadly


"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail
"Theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my
 tail
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance
They are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the
dance?

Will you wont you will you wont you will you join the
dance?
Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the
dance?


"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to
                                                      sea"
But the snail replied "Too far too far" and gave a look
                                                       askance
Said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the
   dance
    Would not could not would not could not would not join
        the dance
    Would not could not would not could not could not join
        the dance

"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied
"There is another shore you know upon the other side
The further off from England the nearer is to France
Then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance

    Will you wont you will you wont you will you join the
         dance?
    Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the
         dance?"



  Thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said
Alice feeling very glad that it was over at last  and I do so
like that curious song about the whiting

  Oh as to the whiting said the Mock Turtle theyyouve
seen them of course?

  Yes said Alice Ive often seen them at dinn she
checked herself hastily

  I dont know where Dinn may be said the Mock Turtle but
if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre
like

  I believe so Alice replied thoughtfully  They have their
tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs

  Youre wrong about the crumbs said the Mock Turtle
crumbs would all wash off in the sea  But they HAVE their tails
in their mouths and the reason is here the Mock Turtle
yawned and shut his eyesTell her about the reason and all
that he said to the Gryphon

  The reason is said the Gryphon that they WOULD go with
the lobsters to the dance  So they got thrown out to sea  So
they had to fall a long way  So they got their tails fast in
their mouths  So they couldnt get them out again  Thats all

  Thank you said Alice its very interesting  I never knew
so much about a whiting before

  I can tell you more than that if you like said the
Gryphon  Do you know why its called a whiting?

  I never thought about it said Alice  Why?

  IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES the Gryphon replied very
solemnly

  Alice was thoroughly puzzled  Does the boots and shoes she
repeated in a wondering tone

  Why what are YOUR shoes done with? said the Gryphon  I
mean what makes them so shiny?

  Alice looked down at them and considered a little before she
gave her answer  Theyre done with blacking I believe

  Boots and shoes under the sea the Gryphon went on in a deep
voice are done with a whiting  Now you know

  And what are they made of? Alice asked in a tone of great
curiosity

  Soles and eels of course the Gryphon replied rather
impatiently  any shrimp could have told you that

  If Id been the whiting said Alice whose thoughts were
still running on the song Id have said to the porpoise "Keep
back please  we dont want YOU with us"

  They were obliged to have him with them the Mock Turtle
