That burden heavier than the earth to bear
Than all the world much heavier though divided
With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desirest
And what thou fearest alike destroys all hope
Of refuge and concludes thee miserable
Beyond all past example and future
To Satan only like both crime and doom
O Conscience into what abyss of fears
And horrours hast thou driven me out of which
I find no way from deep to deeper plunged
Thus Adam to himself lamented loud
Through the still night not now as ere Man fell
Wholesome and cool and mild but with black air
Accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom
Which to his evil conscience represented
All things with double terrour  On the ground
Outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft
Cursed his creation  Death as oft accused
Of tardy execution since denounced
The day of his offence  Why comes not Death
Said he with one thriceacceptable stroke
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word
Justice Divine not hasten to be just?
But Death comes not at call Justice Divine
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries
O woods O fountains hillocks dales and bowers
With other echo late I taught your shades
To answer and resound far other song
Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld
Desolate where she sat approaching nigh
Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed
But her with stern regard he thus repelled
Out of my sight thou Serpent  That name best
Befits thee with him leagued thyself as false
And hateful nothing wants but that thy shape
Like his and colour serpentine may show
Thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
Henceforth lest that too heavenly form pretended
To hellish falshood snare them  But for thee
I had persisted happy had not thy pride
And wandering vanity when least was safe
Rejected my forewarning and disdained
Not to be trusted longing to be seen
Though by the Devil himself him overweening
To overreach but with the serpent meeting
Fooled and beguiled by him thou I by thee
To trust thee from my side imagined wise
Constant mature proof against all assaults
And understood not all was but a show
Rather than solid virtue all but a rib
Crooked by nature bent as now appears
More to the part sinister from me drawn
Well if thrown out as supernumerary
To my just number found  O why did God
Creator wise that peopled highest Heaven
With Spirits masculine create at last
This novelty on earth this fair defect
Of nature and not fill the world at once
With Men as Angels without feminine
Or find some other way to generate
Mankind?  This mischief had not been befallen
And more that shall befall innumerable
Disturbances on earth through female snares
And strait conjunction with this sex for either
He never shall find out fit mate but such
As some misfortune brings him or mistake
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
Through her perverseness but shall see her gained
By a far worse or if she love withheld
By parents or his happiest choice too late
Shall meet already linked and wedlockbound
To a fell adversary his hate or shame
Which infinite calamity shall cause
To human life and houshold peace confound
He added not and from her turned but Eve
Not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing
And tresses all disordered at his feet
Fell humble and embracing them besought
His peace and thus proceeded in her plaint
Forsake me not thus Adam witness Heaven
What love sincere and reverence in my heart
I bear thee and unweeting have offended
Unhappily deceived  Thy suppliant
I beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not
Whereon I live thy gentle looks thy aid
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress
My only strength and stay  Forlorn of thee
Whither shall I betake me where subsist?
