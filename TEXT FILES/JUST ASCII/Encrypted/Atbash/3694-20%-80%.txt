Luxembourg Economy

Overview
    The stable economy features moderate growth low inflation and negligible
    unemployment Agriculture is based on small but highly productive
    familyowned farms The industrial sector until recently dominated by
    steel has become increasingly more diversified particularly toward
    hightechnology firms During the past decade growth in the financial
    sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel Services
    especially banking account for a growing proportion of the economy
    Luxembourg participates in an economic union with Belgium on trade and most
    financial matters and is also closely connected economically to the
    Netherlands
