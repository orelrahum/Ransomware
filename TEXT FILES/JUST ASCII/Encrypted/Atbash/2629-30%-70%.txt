microfilm that AM had made  He awarded a grade of C at best perhaps a
C minus or a C plus for how well it worked out  Indeed the matter of
learning if other people had better ideas about scanning in general and
in particular scanning from microfilm was one of the factors that drove
AM to attempt to think through the agenda for the Workshop  Skew for
example was one of the issues that AM in its ignorance had not reckoned
would prove so difficult

Further the handling of images of the sort shown in a desktop computer
environment involved a considerable amount of zooming and scrolling
Ultimately AM staff feel that perhaps the paper copy that is printed out
might be the most useful one but they remain uncertain as to how much
onscreen reading users will do

Returning to the text FLEISCHHAUER asked viewers to imagine a person who
might be conducting a search in a fulltext environment  With this
scenario he proceeded to illustrate other features of Personal Librarian
that he considered helpful for example it provides the ability to
notice words as one reads  Clicking the "include" button on the bottom
of the search window pops the words that have been highlighted into the
search  Thus a user can refine the search as he or she reads
reexecuting the search and continuing to find things in the quest for
materials  This software not only contains relevance ranking Boolean
operators and truncation it also permits one to perform word algebra
so to say where one puts two or three words in parentheses and links
them with one Boolean operator and then a couple of words in another set
of parentheses and asks for things within so many words of others

Until they became acquainted recently with some of the work being done in
classics the AM staff had not realized that a large number of the
projects that involve electronic texts were being done by people with a
profound interest in language and linguistics  Their search strategies
and thinking are oriented to those fields as is shown in particular by
the Perseus example  As amateur historians the AM staff were thinking
more of searching for concepts and ideas than for particular words
Obviously FLEISCHHAUER conceded searching for concepts and ideas and
searching for words may be two rather closely related things

While displaying several images FLEISCHHAUER observed that the Macintosh
prototype built by AM contains a greater diversity of formats  Echoing a
previous speaker he said that it was easier to stitch things together in
the Macintosh though it tended to be a little more anemic in search and
retrieval  AM therefore increasingly has been investigating
sophisticated retrieval engines in the IBM format

FLEISCHHAUER demonstrated several additional examples of the prototype
interfaces  One was AMs metaphor for the network future in which a
kind of readingroom graphic suggests how one would be able to go around
to different materials  AM contains a large number of photographs in
analog video form worked up from a videodisc which enable users to make
copies to print or incorporate in digital documents  A framegrabber is
built into the system making it possible to bring an image into a window
and digitize or print it out

FLEISCHHAUER next demonstrated sound recording which included texts
Recycled from a previous project the collection included sixty rpm
phonograph records of political speeches that were made during and
immediately after World War I  These constituted approximately three
hours of audio as AM has digitized it which occupy  megabytes on a
CD  Thus they are considerably compressed  From the catalogue card
FLEISCHHAUER proceeded to a transcript of a speech with the audio
available and with highlighted text following it as it played
A photograph has been added and a transcription made

Considerable value has been added beyond what the Library of Congress
normally would do in cataloguing a sound recording which raises several
questions for AM concerning where to draw lines about how much value it can
afford to add and at what point perhaps this becomes more than AM could
reasonably do or reasonably wish to do  FLEISCHHAUER also demonstrated
a motion picture  As FREEMAN had reported earlier the motion picture
materials have proved the most popular not surprisingly  This says more
about the medium he thought than about AMs presentation of it

Because AMs goal was to bring together things that could be used by
historians or by people who were curious about history
turnofthecentury footage seemed to represent the most appropriate
collections from the Library of Congress in motion pictures These were
the very first films made by Thomas Edisons company and some others at
that time  The particular example illustrated was a Biograph film
brought in with a framegrabber into a window  A single videodisc
contains about fifty titles and pieces of film from that period all of
New York City  Taken together AM believes they provide an interesting
documentary resource

                                 


DISCUSSION  Using the framegrabber in AM  Volume of material processed
and to be processed  Purpose of AM within LC  Cataloguing and the
nature of AMs material  SGML coding and the question of quality versus
quantity 


During the questionandanswer period that followed FLEISCHHAUERs
presentation several clarifications were made

AM is bringing in motion pictures from a videodisc  The framegrabber
devices create a window on a computer screen which permits users to
digitize a single frame of the movie or one of the photographs  It
produces a crude roughandready image that high school students can
incorporate into papers and that has worked very nicely in this way

Commenting on FLEISCHHAUERs assertion that AM was looking more at
searching ideas than words MYLONAS argued that without words an idea
does not exist  FLEISCHHAUER conceded that he ought to have articulated
his point more clearly  MYLONAS stated that they were in fact both
talking about the same thing  By searching for words and by forcing
people to focus on the word the Perseus Project felt that they would get
them to the idea  The way one reviews results is tailored more to one
kind of user than another

Concerning the total volume of material that has been processed in this
way AM at this point has in retrievable form seven or eight collections
all of them photographic  In the Macintosh environment for example
there probably are  photographs  The sound recordings
number sixty items  The broadsides number about  items  There are
 political cartoons in the form of drawings  The motion pictures as
individual items number sixty to seventy

AM also has a manuscript collection the life history portion of one of
the federal project series which will contain  individual
documents all firstperson narratives  AM has in process about 
AfricanAmerican pamphlets or about  printed pages for the period
  Also in the works are some  panoramic photographs  AM
has recycled a fair amount of the work done by LCs Prints and
Photographs Division during the Librarys optical disk pilot project in
the s  For example a special division of LC has tooled up and
thought through all the ramifications of electronic presentation of
photographs  Indeed they are wheeling them out in great barrel loads
The purpose of AM within the Library it is hoped is to catalyze several
of the other special collection divisions which have no particular
experience with in some cases mixed feelings about an activity such as
AM  Moreover in many cases the divisions may be characterized as not
only lacking experience in "electronifying" things but also in automated
cataloguing  MARC cataloguing as practiced in the United States is
heavily weighted toward the description of monograph and serial
materials but is much thinner when one enters the world of manuscripts
and things that are held in the Librarys music collection and other
units  In response to a comment by LESK that AMs material is very
heavily photographic and is so primarily because individual records have
been made for each photograph FLEISCHHAUER observed that an itemlevel
catalog record exists for example for each photograph in the Detroit
Publishing collection of  pictures  In the case of the Federal
Writers Project for which nearly  documents exist representing
information from twentysix different states AM with the assistance of
Karen STUART of the Manuscript Division will attempt to find some waB MLG
