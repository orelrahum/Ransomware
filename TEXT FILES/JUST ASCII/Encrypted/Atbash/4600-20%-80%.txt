Disputes
    Antarctic Treaty defers claims see Antarctic Treaty Summary below
    sections some overlapping claimed by Argentina Australia Chile France
    Adelie Land New Zealand Ross Dependency Norway Queen Maud Land and
    UK the US and Russia do not recognize the territorial claims of other
    nations and have made no claims themselves but reserve the right to do so
    no formal claims have been made in the sector between  west and 
    west where because of floating ice Antarctica is unapproachable from the
    sea
Climate
    severe low temperatures vary with latitude elevation and distance from the
    ocean East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher
    elevation Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate higher
    temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below
    freezing
Terrain
    about  thick continental ice sheet and  barren rock with average
    elevations between  and  meters mountain ranges up to 
    meters high icefree coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land
    Wilkes Land the Antarctic Peninsula area and Ross Island on McMurdo Sound
    glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline and floating
    ice shelves constitute  of the area of the continent
Natural resources
    none presently exploited iron chromium copper gold nickel platinum
    and other minerals and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small
    uncommercial quantities
Land use
    no arable land and no plant growth ice  barren rock 
Environment
    mostly uninhabitable katabatic gravitydriven winds blow coastward from
    the high interior frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau a
    circumpolar ocean current flows clockwise along the coast as do cyclonic
    storms that form over the ocean during summer more solar radiation reaches
    the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
    equivalent period in October  it was reported that the ozone shield
    which protects the Earths surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation had
    dwindled to its lowest level ever over Antarctica active volcanism on
    Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica other seismic
    activity rare and weak
Note
