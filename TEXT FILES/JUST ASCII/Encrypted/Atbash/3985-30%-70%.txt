Reunion Economy

Overview
    The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture Sugarcane has been
    the primary crop for more than a century and in some years it accounts for
     of exports The government has been pushing the development of a tourist
    industry to relieve high unemployment which recently amounted to onethird
    of the labor force The gap in Reunion between the welloff and the poor is
    extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions The white and
    Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
    population often approaching European standards whereas indigenous groups
    suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the
    African continent The outbreak of severe rioting in February 
    illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions The economic
    wellbeing of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from
    France
