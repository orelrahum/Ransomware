ORLANDO	Nothing I am not taught to make any thing

OLIVER	What mar you then sir?

ORLANDO	Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God
	made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness

OLIVER	Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile

ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
	What prodigal portion have I spent that I should
	come to such penury?

OLIVER	Know you where your are sir?

ORLANDO	O sir very well here in your orchard

OLIVER	Know you before whom sir?

ORLANDO	Ay better than him I am before knows me I know
	you are my eldest brother and in the gentle
	condition of blood you should so know me The
	courtesy of nations allows you my better in that
	you are the firstborn but the same tradition
	takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers
	betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as
	you albeit I confess your coming before me is
	nearer to his reverence

OLIVER	What boy

ORLANDO	Come come elder brother you are too young in this

OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me villain?

ORLANDO	I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir
	Rowland de Boys he was my father and he is thrice
	a villain that says such a father begot villains
	Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand
	from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
	tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself

ADAM	Sweet masters be patient for your fathers
	remembrance be at accord

OLIVER	Let me go I say

ORLANDO	I will not till I please you shall hear me My
	father charged you in his will to give me good
	education you have trained me like a peasant
	obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike
	qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in
	me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow
	me such exercises as may become a gentleman or
	give me the poor allottery my father left me by
	testament with that I will go buy my fortunes

OLIVER	And what wilt thou do? beg when that is spent?
	Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled
	with you you shall have some part of your will I
	pray you leave me

ORLANDO	I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good

OLIVER	Get you with him you old dog

ADAM	Is old dog my reward? Most true I have lost my
	teeth in your service God be with my old master
	he would not have spoke such a woIW
