World Economy

Overview
    Aggregate world output in  increased by  in contrast to estimated
     growth in  and  growth in  In  the developed countries
    grew by  and the LDCs by  these gains being offset by a  drop
    in the former Communistdominated areas of the USSR and Eastern Europe As
    usual results among individual countries differed widely In the developed
    group Japan led with  the West European members averaged  and the
    recessionplagued United States laggedwith GDP down  As for the 
    former Soviet republics and the seven nations of Eastern Europe output
    plummeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the
    rules of the game and in the channels of production and exchange China and
    the Four Dragons performed well in  but many of the other developing
    countries are mired in poverty and political instability For the world as a
    whole the addition of nearly  million people each year to an already
    overcrowded globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution

Industries
    industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology especially in
    computers robotics telecommunications and medicines and medical
    equipment most of these advances take place in OECD nations only a small
    portion of nonOECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
    technological forces and the technological gap between the industrial
    nations and the lessdeveloped countries continues to widen the rapid
    development of new industrial and agricultural technology is complicating
    already grim environmental problems

World Economy

Agriculture
    the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last
     years The annual production of cereals for instance has risen by 
    from about  billion metric tons to about  billion metric tons
    production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
    increases in planted areas while global production is sufficient for
    aggregate demand about onefifth of the worlds population remains
    malnourished primarily because local production cannot adequately provide
    for large and rapidly growing populations which are too poor to pay for
    food imports conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
    recent years has exacerbated the consequences of all other factors
