handle that  Given this state of affairs and assuming that the
technicaljournal producers and the commercial vendors decide to use the
other two types then an institution like the Library of Congress which
might receive all of their publications would have to be able to handle
three different types of document definitions and tag sets and be able to
distinguish among them

Office Document Architecture ODA has some advantages that flow from its
tight focus on office documents and clear directions for implementation
Much of the ODA standard is easier to read and clearer at first reading
than the SGML standard which is extremely general  What that means is
that if one wants to use graphics in TIFF and ODA one is stuck because
ODA defines graphics formats while TIFF does not whereas SGML says the
world is not waiting for this work group to create another graphics format
What is needed is an ability to use whatever graphics format one wants

The TEI provides a socket that allows one to connect the SGML document to
the graphics  The notation that the graphics are in is clearly a choice
that one needs to make based on her or his environment and that is one
advantage  SGML is less megalomaniacal in attempting to define formats
for all kinds of information though more megalomaniacal in attempting to
cover all sorts of documents  The other advantage is that the model of
text represented by SGML is simply an order of magnitude richer and more
flexible than the model of text offered by ODA  Both offer hierarchical
structures but SGML recognizes that the hierarchical model of the text
that one is looking at may not have been in the minds of the designers
whereas ODA does not

ODA is not really aiming for the kind of document that the TEI wants to
encompass  The TEI can handle the kind of material ODA has as well as a
significantly broader range of material  ODA seems to be very much
focused on office documents which is what it started out being called
office document architecture

                                 


CALALUCA  Textencoding from a publishers perspective 
Responsibilities of a publisher  Reproduction of Mignes Latin series
whole and complete with SGML tags based on perceived need and expected
use  Particular decisions arising from the general decision to produce
and publish PLD 


The final speaker in this session Eric CALALUCA vice president
ChadwyckHealey Inc spoke from the perspective of a publisher re
textencoding rather than as one qualified to discuss methods of
encoding data and observed that the presenters sitting in the room
whether they had chosen to or not were acting as publishers  making
choices gathering data gathering information and making assessments
CALALUCA offered the hardwon conviction that in publishing very large
text files such as PLD one cannot avoid making personal judgments of
appropriateness and structure

In CALALUCAs view encoding decisions stem from prior judgments  Two
notions have become axioms for him in the consideration of future sources
for electronic publication   electronic text publishing is as personal
as any other kind of publishing and questions of if and how to encode
the data are simply a consequence of that prior decision   all
personal decisions are open to criticism which is unavoidable

CALALUCA rehearsed his role as a publisher or better as an intermediary
between what is viewed as a sound idea and the people who would make use
of it  Finding the specialist to advise in this process is the core of
that function  The publisher must monitor and hug the fine line between
giving users what they want and suggesting what they might need  One
responsibility of a publisher is to represent the desires of scholars and
research librarians as opposed to bullheadedly forcing them into areas
they would not choose to enter

CALALUCA likened the questions being raised today about data structure
and standards to the decisions faced by the Abbe Migne himself during
production of the Patrologia series in the midnineteenth century
ChadwyckHealeys decision to reproduce Mignes Latin series whole and
complete with SGML tags was also based upon a perceived need and an
expected use  In the same way that Mignes work came to be far more than
a simple handbook for clerics PLD is already far more than a database
for theologians  It is a bedrock source for the study of Western
civilization CALALUCA asserted

In regard to the decision to produce and publish PLD the editorial board
offered direct judgments on the question of appropriateness of these
texts for conversion their encoding and their distribution and
concluded that the best possible project was one that avoided overt
intrusions or exclusions in so important a resource  Thus the general
decision to transmit the original collection as clearly as possible with
the widest possible avenues for use led to other decisions   To encode
the data or not SGML or not TEI or not  Again the expected user
community asserted the need for normative tagging structures of important
humanities texts and the TEI seemed the most appropriate structure for
that purpose  Research librarians who are trained to view the larger
impact of electronic text sources on  or  or  doctoral
disciplines loudly approved the decision to include tagging  They see
what is coming better than the specialist who is completely focused on
one edition of Ambroses De Anima and they also understand that the
potential uses exceed present expectations   What will be tagged and
what will not  Once again the board realized that one must tag the
obvious  But in no way should one attempt to identify through encoding
schemes every single discrete area of a text that might someday be
searched  That was another decision  Searching by a column number an
author a word a volume permitting combination searches and tagging
notations seemed logical choices as core elements   How does one make
the data available?  Tieing it to a CDROM edition creates limitations
but a magnetic tape file that is very large is accompanied by the
encoding specifications and that allows one to make local modifications
also allows one to incorporate any changes one may desire within the
bounds of private research though exporting tag files from a CDROM
could serve just as well  Since no one on the board could possibly
anticipate each and every way in which a scholar might choose to mine
this data bank it was decided to satisfy the basics and make some
provisions for what might come   Not to encode the database would rob
it of the interchangeability and portability these important texts should
accommodate  For CALALUCA the extensive options presented by fulltext
searching require care in text selection and strongly support encoding of
data to facilitate the widest possible search strategies  Better
software can always be created but summoning the resources the people
and the energy to reconvert the text is another matter

PLD is being encoded captured and distributed because to
ChadwyckHealey and the board it offers the widest possible array of
future research applications that can be seen today  CALALUCA concluded
by urging the encoding of all important text sources in whatever way
seems most appropriate and durable at the time without blanching at the
thought that ones work may require emendation in the future  Thus
ChadwyckHealey produced a very large humanities text database before the
final release of the TEI Guidelines

                                 


DISCUSSION  Creating texts with markup advocated  Trends in encoding 
The TEI and the issue of interchangeability of standards  A
misconception concerning the TEI  Implications for an institution like
LC in the event that a multiplicity of DTDs develops  Producing images
as a first step towards possible conversion to full text through
character recognition  The AAP tag sets as a common starting point and
the need for caution 


HOCKEY prefaced the discussion that followed with several comments in
favor of creating texts with markup and on trends in encoding  In the
future when many more texts are available for online searching real
problems in finding what is wanted will develop if one is faced with
millions of words of data  It therefore becomes important to consider
putting markup in texts to help searchers home in on the actual things
they wish to retrieve  Various approaches to refining retrieval methods
toward this end include building on a computer version of a dictionary
and letting the computer look up words in it to obtain more information
about the semantic structure or semantic field of a word its grammatical
structure and syntactic structure

HOCKEY commented on the present keen interest in the encoding world
in creating   machinereadable versions of dictionaries that can be
initially tagged RM HTNO DSRXS TREVH Z HGIFXGFIV GL GSV WRXGRLMZIB VMGIB
