but is not enough to do it for full text that is make full texts
interoperable

WEIBEL next outlined the critical role of SGML for a variety of purposes
for example as noted by HOCKEY in the world of extremely large
databases using highly structured data to perform field searches
WEIBEL argued that by building the structure of the data in ie the
structure of the data originally on a printed page it becomes easy to
look at a journal article even if one cannot read the characters and know
where the title or author is or what the sections of that document would be
OCLC wants to make that structure explicit in the database because it will
be important for retrieval purposes

The second big advantage of SGML is that it gives one the ability to
build structure into the database that can be used for display purposes
without contaminating the data with instructions about how to format
things  The distinction lies between procedural markup which tells one
where to put dots on the page and descriptive markup which describes
the elements of a document

WEIBEL believes that there should be no procedural markup in the data at
all that the data should be completely unsullied by information about
italics or boldness  That should be left up to the display device
whether that display device is a page printer or a screen display device
By keeping ones database free of that kind of contamination one can
make decisions down the road for example reorganize the data in ways
that are not cramped by builtin notions of what should be italic and
what should be bold  WEIBEL strongly advocated descriptive markup  As
an example he illustrated the index structure in the CORE data  With
subsequent illustrated examples of markup WEIBEL acknowledged the common
complaint that SGML is hard to read in its native form although markup
decreases considerably once one gets into the body  Without the markup
however one would not have the structure in the data  One can pass
markup through a LaTeX processor and convert it relatively easily to a
printed version of the document

WEIBEL next illustrated an extremely cluttered screen dump of OCLCs
system in order to show as much as possible the inherent capability on
the screen  He noted parenthetically that he had become a supporter of
XWindows as a result of the progress of the CORE Project  WEIBEL also
illustrated the two major parts of the interface  l a control box that
allows one to generate lists of items which resembles a small table of
contents based on key words one wishes to search and  a document
viewer which is a separate process in and of itself  He demonstrated
how to follow links through the electronic database simply by selecting
the appropriate button and bringing them up  He also noted problems that
remain to be accommodated in the interface eg as pointed out by LESK
what happens when users do not click on the icon for the figure

Given the constraints of time WEIBEL omitted a large number of ancillary
items in order to say a few words concerning storage requirements and
what will be required to put a lot of things on line  Since it is
extremely expensive to reconvert all of this data especially if it is
just in paper form and even if it is in electronic form in typesetting
tapes he advocated building journals electronically from the start  In
that case if one only has text graphics and indexing which is all that
one needs with de novo electronic publishing because there is no need to
go back and look at bitmaps of pages one can get  journals of
full text or almost  million pages per year  These pages can be put in
approximately  gigabytes of storage which is not all that much
WEIBEL said  For twenty years something less than three terabytes would
be required  WEIBEL calculated the costs of storing this information as
follows  If a gigabyte costs approximately  then a terabyte costs
approximately  million to buy in terms of hardware  One also needs a
building to put it in and a staff like OCLC to handle that information
So to support a terabyte multiply by five which gives  million per
year for a supported terabyte of data

                                 


DISCUSSION  Tapes saved by ACS are the typography files originally
supporting publication of the journal  Cost of building tagged text into
the database 


During the questionandanswer period that followed WEIBELs
presentation these clarifications emerged  The tapes saved by the
American Chemical Society are the typography files that originally
supported the publication of the journal  Although they are not tagged
in SGML they are tagged in very fine detail  Every single sentence is
marked all the registry numbers all the publications issues dates and
volumes  No cost figures on tagging material on a permegabyte basis
were available  Because ACSs typesetting system runs from tagged text
there is no extra cost per article  It was unknown what it costs ACS to
keyboard the tagged text rather than just keyboard the text in the
cheapest process  In other words since one intends to publish things
and will need to build tagged text into a typography system in any case
if one does that in such a way that it can drive not only typography but
an electronic system which is what ACS intends to domove to SGML
publishing the marginal cost is zero  The marginal cost represents the
cost of building tagged text into the database which is small

                                 


SPERBERGMcQUEEN  Distinction between texts and computers  Implications
of recognizing that all representation is encoding  Dealing with
complicated representations of text entails the need for a grammar of

electronic form  SGML the TEI documenttype declarations and the

of the TEI  Several design goals for the TEI tag set  An absolutely
fixed requirement of the TEI Guidelines  Challenges the TEI has

simulacra for the text redux  Ones model of text determines what ones
software can do with a text and has economic consequences 


Prior to speaking about SGML and markup Michael SPERBERGMcQUEEN editor
Text Encoding Initiative TEI University of IllinoisChicago first drew
a distinction between texts and computers  Texts are abstract cultural
and linguistic objects while computers are complicated physical devices
he said  Abstract objects cannot be placed inside physical devices with
computers one can only represent text and act upon those representations

The recognition that all representation is encoding SPERBERGMcQUEEN
argued leads to the recognition of two things   The topic description
for this session is slightly misleading because there can be no discussion
of pros and cons of textcoding unless what one means is pros and cons of
working with text with computers   No text can be represented in a
computer without some sort of encoding images are one way of encoding text
ASCII is another SGML yet another  There is no encoding without some
information loss that is there is no perfect reproduction of a text that
allows one to do away with the original  Thus the question becomes
What is the most useful representation of text for a serious work?
This depends on what kind of serious work one is talking about

The projects demonstrated the previous day all involved highly complex
information and fairly complex manipulation of the textual material
In order to use that complicated information one has to calculate it
slowly or manually and store the result  It needs to be stored therefore
as part of ones representation of the text  Thus one needs to store the
structure in the text  To deal with complicated representations of text
one needs somehow to control the complexity of the representation of a text
that means one needs a way of finding out whether a document and an
electronic representation of a document is legal or not and that
means one needs a grammar of documents

SPERBERGMcQUEEN discussed the variety of forms of formal grammars
implicit and explicit as applied to text and their capabilities  He
argued that these grammars correspond to different models of text that
different developers have  For example one implicit model of the text
is that there is no internal structure but just one thing after another
a few characters and then perhaps a starttitle command and then a few
more characters and an endtitle command  SPERBERGMcQUEEN also
distinguished several kinds of text that have a sort of hierarchical
structure that is not very well defined which typically corresponds
to grammars that are not very well defined as well as hierarchies that
are very well defined eg the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae and extremely
complicated things such as SGML which handle strictly hierarchical data
very nicely

SPERBERGMcQUEEN conceded that one other model not illustrated on his two
displays was the model of text as a bitmapped image an image of a page
and confessed to having been converted to a limited extent by the
Workshop to the view that electronic images constitute a promising
probably superior alternative to microfilming  But he was not convinced
that electronic images represent a serious attempt to represent text in
electronic form  Many of their problems stem from the fact that they are
not direct attempts to represent the text but attempts to represent the
page thus making them representations of representations

In this situation of increasingly complicated textual information and the
need to control that complexity in a useful way which begs the question
of the need for good textual grammars one has the introduction of SGML
With SGML one can develop specific documenttype declarations
for specific text types or as with the TEI attempts to generate
general documenttype declarations that can handle all sorts of text
The TEI is an attempt to develop formats for text representation that
will ensure the kind of reusability and longevity of data discussed earlier
It offers a way to stay alive in the state of permanent technological
revolution

It has been a continuing challenge in the TEI to create document grammars
that do some work in controlling the complexity of the textual object but
also allowing one to represent the real text that one will find
Fundamental to the notion of the TEI is that TEI conformance allows one
the ability to extend or modify the TEI tag set so that it fits the text
that one is attempting to represent

SPERBERGMcQUEEN next outlined the administrative background of the TEI
The TEI is an international project to develop and disseminate guidelines
for the encoding and interchange of machinereadable text  It is
sponsored by the Association for Computers in the Humanities the
Association for Computational Linguistics and the Association for
Literary and Linguistic Computing  Representatives of numerous other
professional societies sit on its advisory board  The TEI has a number
of affiliated projects that have provided assistance by testing drafts of
the guidelines

Among the design goals for the TEI tag set the scheme first of all must
meet the needs of research because the TEI came out of the research
community which did not feel adequately served by existing tag sets
The tag set must be extensive as well as compatible with existing and
emerging standards  In  version  of the Guidelines was released
SPERBERGMcQUEEN illustrated their contents

SPERBERGMcQUEEN noted that one problem besetting electronic text has
been the lack of adequate internal or external documentation for many
existing electronic texts  The TEI guidelines as currently formulated
contain few fixed requirements but one of them is this  There must
always be a document header an infile SGML tag that provides
 a bibliographic description of the electronic object one is talking
about that is who included it when what for and under which title
and  the copy text from which it was derived if any  If there was
no copy text or if the copy text is unknown then one states as much
Version  of the Guidelines was scheduled to be completed in fall 
and a revised third version is to be presented to the TEI advisory board
for its endorsement this coming winter  The TEI itself exists to provide
a markup language not a markedup text

Among the challenges the TEI has attempted to face is the need for a
markup language that will work for existing projects that is handle the
level of markup that people are using now to tag only chapter section
and paragraph divisions and not much else  At the same time such a
language also will be able to scale up gracefully to handlV GSV SRTSOB
