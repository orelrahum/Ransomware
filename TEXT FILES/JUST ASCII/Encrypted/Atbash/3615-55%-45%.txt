  Call the next witness said the King

  The next witness was the Duchesss cook  She carried the
pepperbox in her hand and Alice guessed who it was even before
she got into the court by the way the people near the door began
sneezing all at once

  Give your evidence said the King

  Shant said the cook

  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit who said in a
low voice Your Majesty must crossexamine THIS witness

  Well if I must I must the King said with a melancholy
air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till
his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice What
are tarts made of?

  Pepper mostly said the cook

  Treacle said a sleepy voice behind her

  Collar that Dormouse the Queen shrieked out  Behead that
Dormouse  Turn that Dormouse out of court  Suppress him  Pinch
him  Off with his whiskers

  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the
Dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down
again the cook had disappeared

  Never mind said the King with an air of great relief
Call the next witness  And he added in an undertone to the
Queen Really my dear YOU must crossexamine the next witness
It quite makes my forehead ache

  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like
for they havent got much evidence YET she said to herself
Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out at the top
of his shrill little voice the name Alice



                           CHAPTER XII

                        Alices Evidence


  Here cried Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with
the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
the week before

  Oh I BEG your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
and put back into the jurybox or they would die

  The trial cannot proceed said the King in a very grave
voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places
ALL he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at Alice as
he said do

  Alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she
had put the Lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable
to move  She soon got it out again and put it right not that
it signifies much she said to herself I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other

  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write
out a history of the accident all except the Lizard who seemed
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open
gazing up into the roof of the court

  What do you know about this business? the King said to
Alice

  Nothing said Alice

  Nothing WHATEVER? persisted the King

  Nothing whatever said Alice

  Thats very important the King said turning to the jury
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates when
the White Rabbit interrupted  UNimportant your Majesty means
of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and
making faces at him as he spoke

  UNimportant of course I meant the King hastily said and
went on to himself in an undertone importantunimportant
unimportantimportant as if he were trying which word
sounded best

  Some of the jury wrote it down important and some
unimportant  Alice could see this as she was near enough to
look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she
thought to herself

  At this moment the King who had been for some time busily
writing in his notebook cackled out Silence and read out
from his book Rule Fortytwo  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT

  Everybody looked at Alice

  IM not a mile high said Alice

  You are said the King

  Nearly two miles high added the Queen

  Well I shant go at any rate said Alice  besides
thats not a regular rule  you invented it just now

  Its the oldest rule in the book said the King

  Then it ought to be Number One said Alice

  The King turned pale and shut his notebook hastily
Consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling
voice

  Theres more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said
the White Rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has
just been picked up

  Whats in it? said the Queen

  I havent opened it yet said the White Rabbit but it seems
to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody

  It must have been that said the King unless it was
written to nobody which isnt usual you know

  Who is it directed to? said one of the jurymen

  It isnt directed at all said the White Rabbit in fact
theres nothing written on the OUTSIDE  He unfolded the paper
as he spoke and added It isnt a letter after all  its a set
of verses

  Are they in the prisoners handwriting? asked another of
they jurymen

  No theyre not said the White Rabbit and thats the
queerest thing about it  The jury all looked puzzled

  He must have imitated somebody elses hand said the King
The jury all brightened up again

  Please your Majesty said the Knave I didnt write it and
they cant prove I did  theres no name signed at the end

  If you didnt sign it said the King that only makes the
matter worse  You MUST have meant some mischief or else youd
have signed your name like an honest man

  There was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the
first really clever thing the King had said that day

  That PROVES his guilt said the Queen

  It proves nothing of the sort said Alice  Why you dont
even know what theyre about

  Read them said the King

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles  Where shall I begin
please your Majesty? he asked

  Begin at the beginning the King said gravely and go on
till you come to the end  then stop

  These were the verses the White Rabbit read

        They told me you had been to her
          And mentioned me to him
        She gave me a good character
          But said I could not swim

        He sent them word I had not gone
          We know it to be true
        If she should push the matter on
          What would become of you?

        I gave her one they gave him two
          You gave us three or more
        They all returned from him to you
          Though they were mine before

        If I or she should chance to be
          Involved in this affair
        He trusts to you to set them free
          Exactly as we were

        My notion was that you had been
          Before she had this fit
        An obstacle that came between
          Him and ourselves and it

        Dont let him know she liked them best
          For this must ever be
        A secret kept from all the rest
          Between yourself and me

  Thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet
said the King rubbing his hands so now let the jury

  If any one of them can explain it said Alice she had
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit
afraid of interrupting him Ill give him sixpence  I dont
believe theres an atom of meaning in it

  The jury all wrote down on their slates SHE doesnt believe
theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to
explain the paper

  If theres no meaning in it said the King that saves a
world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any  And
yet I dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his
knee and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some
meaning in them after all  "SAID I COULD NOT SWIM" you
cant swim can you? he added turning to the Knave

  The Knave shook his head sadly  Do I look like it? he said
Which he certainly did NOT being made entirely of cardboard

  All right so far said the King and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself  "WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE" thats
the jury of course "I GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO" why
that must be what he did with the tarts you know

  But it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU" said
Alice

  Why there they are said the King triumphantly pointing to
the tarts on the table  Nothing can be clearer than THAT
Then again"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT"  you never had fits my
dear I think? he said to the Queen

  Never said the Queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke  The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no
mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was
trickling down his face as long as it lasted

  Then the words dont FIT you said the King looking round
the court with a smile  There was a dead silence

  Its a pun the King added in an offended tone and
everybody laughed Let the jury consider their verdict the
King said for about the twentieth time that day

  No no said the Queen  Sentence firstverdict afterwards

  Stuff and nonsense said Alice loudly  The idea of having
the sentence first

  Hold your tongue said the Queen turning purple

  I wont said Alice

  Off with her head the Queen shouted at the top of her voice
Nobody moved

  Who cares for you? said Alice she had grown to her full
size by this time  Youre nothing but a pack of cards

  At this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying
down upon her  she gave a little scream half of fright and half
of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on
the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face

  Wake up Alice dear said her sister Why what a long
sleep youve had

  Oh Ive had such a curious dream said Alice and she told
her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and
when she had finished her sister kissed her and said It WAS a
curious dream dear certainly  but now run in to your tea its
getting late  So Alice got up and ran off thinking while she
ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been

  But her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her
head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures till she too began
dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream

  First she dreamed of little Alice herself and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her
voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyesand
still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
sisters dream

  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
bythe frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their neverending meal
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the
Duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce
more the shriek of the Gryphon the squeaking of the Lizards
slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs
filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle

  So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in
Wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and
all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only
rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep
bells and the Queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the Gryphon and
all thy other queer noises would change she knew to the
confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtles
heavy sobs

  Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how
she would keep through all her riper years the simple and
loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about
her other little children and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their
simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys
remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days

SCENE I	Orchard of Olivers house


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

ORLANDO	As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion
	bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns
	and as thou sayest charged my brother on his
	blessing to breed me well and there begins my
	sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and
	report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part
	he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more
	properly stays me here at home unkept for call you
	that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that
	differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
	are bred better for besides that they are fair
	with their feeding they are taught their manage
	and to that end riders dearly hired but I his
	brother gain nothing under him but growth for the
	which his animals on his dunghills are as much
	bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so
	plentifully gives me the something that nature gave
	me his countenance seems to take from me he lets
	me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
	brother and as much as in him lies mines my
	gentility with my education This is it Adam that
	grieves me and the spirit of my father which I
	think is within me begins to mutiny against this
	servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I
	know no wise remedy how to avoid it

ADAM	Yonder comes my master your brother

ORLANDO	Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will
	shake me up

	Enter OLIVER

OLIVER	Now sir what make you here?

ORLANDO	Nothing I am not taught to make any thing

OLIVER	What mar you then sir?

ORLANDO	Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God
	made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness

OLIVER	Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile

ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
	What prodigal portion have I spent that I should
	come to such penury?

OLIVER	Know you where your are sir?

ORLANDO	O sir very well here in your orchard

OLIVER	Know you before whom sir?

ORLANDO	Ay better than him I am before knows me I know
	you are my eldest brother and in the gentle
	condition of blood you should so know me The
	courtesy of nations allows you my better in that
	you are the firstborn but the same tradition
	takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers
	betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as
	you albeit I confess your coming before me is
	nearer to his reverence

OLIVER	What boy

ORLANDO	Come come elder brother you are too young in this

OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me villain?

ORLANDO	I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir
	Rowland de Boys he was my father and he is thrice
	a villain that says such a father begot villains
	Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand
	from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
	tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself

ADAM	Sweet masters be patient for your fathers
	remembrance be at accord

OLIVER	Let me go I say

ORLANDO	I will not till I please you shall hear me My
	father charged you in his will to give me good
	education you have trained me like a peasant
	obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike
	qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in
	me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow
	me such exercises as may become a gentleman or
	give me the poor allottery my father left me by
	testament with that I will go buy my fortunes

OLIVER	And what wilt thou do? beg when that is spent?
	Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled
	with you you shall have some part of your will I
	pray you leave me

ORLANDO	I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good

OLIVER	Get you with him you old dog

ADAM	Is old dog my reward? Most true I have lost my
	teeth in your service God be with my old master
	he would not have spoke such a word

	Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM
