Zimbabwe Economy

Overview
    Agriculture employs threefourths of the labor force and supplies almost 
    of exports The manufacturing sector based on agriculture and mining
    produces a variety of goods and contributes  to GDP Mining accounts for
    only  of both GDP and employment but supplies of minerals and metals
    account for about  of exports Wide yeartoyear fluctuations in
    agricultural production over the past six years have resulted in an uneven
    growth rate one that on average has matched the  annual increase in
    population Helped by an IMFWorld Bank structural adjustment program

by the official sector whose main objective is other than development
motivated or whose grant element is below the  threshold for ODA OOF

official sector that does not meet concessional terms Aid is considered to
have been committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and
constitute a formal declaration of intent

Dependent area refers to a broad category of political entities that are
associated in some way with a nation Names used for page headings are usually
the shortform names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names The
longform name is included in the Government section and an entry of
none indicates a longform name does not exist In some instances no
shortform name exists  then the longform name must serve for all usages

GNPGDP methodology In the Economy section GNPGDP dollar estimates for
the OECD countries the former Soviet republics and the East European
countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP calculations rather
than from conversions at official currency exchange rates The PPP method
normally involves the use of international dollar price weights which are
applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy
In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries the
statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying identifying and allowing
for the quality of goods and services The division of a PPP GNPGDP estimate
in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP
conversion rate One thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods
in the US as one thousand dollars  converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate  will buy in the other country GNPGDP estimates for the
LDCs on the other hand are based on the conversion of GNPGDP estimates in
local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates One
caution the proportion of say defense expenditures as a percent of GNPGDP
in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when
GNPGDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms as for example when an observer
estimates the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures
similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency
exchange rate procedures Finally as academic research moves forward on the
PPP method we hope to convert all GNPGDP estimates to this method in future
editions of The World Factbook

Growth rate population The annual percent change in the population
resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over deaths and the balance
of migrants entering and leaving a country The rate may be positive or
negative

of an internal register Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag

maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory Although the
nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in
