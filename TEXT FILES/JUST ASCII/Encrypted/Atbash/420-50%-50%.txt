	them illfavouredly

JAQUES	Rosalind is your loves name?

ORLANDO	Yes just

JAQUES	I do not like her name

ORLANDO	There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
	christened

JAQUES	What stature is she of?

ORLANDO	Just as high as my heart

JAQUES	You are full of pretty answers Have you not been
	acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them
	out of rings?

ORLANDO	Not so but I answer you right painted cloth from
	whence you have studied your questions

JAQUES	You have a nimble wit I think twas made of
	Atalantas heels Will you sit down with me? and
	we two will rail against our mistress the world and
	all our misery

ORLANDO	I will chide no breather in the world but myself
	against whom I know most faults

JAQUES	The worst fault you have is to be in love

ORLANDO	Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue
	I am weary of you

JAQUES	By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found
	you

ORLANDO	He is drowned in the brook look but in and you
	shall see him

JAQUES	There I shall see mine own figure

ORLANDO	Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher

JAQUES	Ill tarry no longer with you farewell good
	Signior Love

ORLANDO	I am glad of your departure adieu good Monsieur
	Melancholy

	Exit JAQUES

ROSALIND	Aside to CELIA  I will speak to him like a saucy
	lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
	Do you hear forester?

ORLANDO	Very well what would you?

ROSALIND	I pray you what ist oclock?

ORLANDO	You should ask me what time o day theres no clock
	in the forest

ROSALIND	Then there is no true lover in the forest else
	sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
	detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock

ORLANDO	And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
	been as proper?

ROSALIND	By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with
	divers persons Ill tell you who Time ambles
	withal who Time trots withal who Time gallops
	withal and who he stands still withal

ORLANDO	I prithee who doth he trot withal?

ROSALIND	Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
	contract of her marriage and the day it is
	solemnized if the interim be but a sennight
	Times pace is so hard that it seems the length of
	seven year

ORLANDO	Who ambles Time withal?

ROSALIND	With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
	hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because
	he cannot study and the other lives merrily because
	he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean
	and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden
	of heavy tedious penury these Time ambles withal

ORLANDO	Who doth he gallop withal?

ROSALIND	With a thief to the gallows for though he go as
	softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there

ORLANDO	Who stays it still withal?

ROSALIND	With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between
	term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves

ORLANDO	Where dwell you pretty youth?

ROSALIND	With this shepherdess my sister here in the
	skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat

ORLANDO	Are you native of this place?

ROSALIND	As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled

ORLANDO	Your accent is something finer than you could
	purchase in so removed a dwelling

ROSALIND	I have been told so of many but indeed an old
	religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was
	in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship
	too well for there he fell in love I have heard
	him read many lectures against it and I thank God
	I am not a woman to be touched with so many
	giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
	whole sex withal

ORLANDO	Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
	laid to the charge of women?

ROSALIND	There were none principal they were all like one
	another as halfpence are every one fault seeming
	monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it

ORLANDO	I prithee recount some of them

ROSALIND	No I will not cast away my physic but on those that
	are sick There is a man haunts the forest that
	abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on
	their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
	on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of
	Rosalind if I could meet that fancymonger I would
	give him some good counsel for he seems to have the
	quotidian of love upon him

ORLANDO	I am he that is so loveshaked I pray you tell me
	your remedy

ROSALIND	There is none of my uncles marks upon you he
	taught me how to know a man in love in which cage
	of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner

ORLANDO	What were his marks?

ROSALIND	A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and
	sunken which you have not an unquestionable
	spirit which you have not a beard neglected
	which you have not but I pardon you for that for
	simply your having in beard is a younger brothers
	revenue then your hose should be ungartered your
	bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe
	untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
	careless desolation but you are no such man you
	are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as
	loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other

ORLANDO	Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love

ROSALIND	Me believe it you may as soon make her that you
	love believe it which I warrant she is apter to
	do than to confess she does that is one of the
	points in the which women still give the lie to
	their consciences But in good sooth are you he
	that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind
	is so admired?

ORLANDO	I swear to thee youth by the white hand of
	Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he

ROSALIND	But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?

ORLANDO	Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much

ROSALIND	Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves
	as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and
	the reason why they are not so punished and cured
	is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
	are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel

ORLANDO	Did you ever cure any so?

ROSALIND	Yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me
	his love his mistress and I set him every day to
	woo me at which time would I being but a moonish
	youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing
	and liking proud fantastical apish shallow
	inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
	passion something and for no passion truly any
	thing as boys and women are for the most part
	cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe
	him then entertain him then forswear him now weep
	for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor
	from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
	madness which was to forswear the full stream of
	the world and to live in a nook merely monastic
	And thus I cured him and this way will I take upon
	me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps
	heart that there shall not be one spot of love int

ORLANDO	I would not be cured youth

ROSALIND	I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind
	and come every day to my cote and woo me

ORLANDO	Now by the faith of my love I will tell me
	where it is

ROSALIND	Go with me to it and Ill show it you and by the way
	you shall tell me where in the forest you live
	Will you go?

ORLANDO	With all my heart good youth

ROSALIND	Nay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you go?

	Exeunt

ACT III



SCENE III	The forest


	Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY JAQUES behind

TOUCHSTONE	Come apace good Audrey I will fetch up your
	goats Audrey And how Audrey? am I the man yet?
	doth my simple feature content you?

AUDREY	Your features Lord warrant us what features

TOUCHSTONE	I am here with thee and thy goats as the most
	capricious poet honest Ovid was among the Goths

JAQUES	Aside  O knowledge illinhabited worse than Jove
	in a thatched house

TOUCHSTONE	When a mans verses cannot be understood nor a
	mans good wit seconded with the forward child
	Understanding it strikes a man more dead than a
	great reckoning in a little room Truly I would
	the gods had made thee poetical

AUDREY	I do not know what poetical is is it honest in
	deed and word? is it a true thing?

TOUCHSTONE	No truly for the truest poetry is the most
	feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what
	they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign

AUDREY	Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?

TOUCHSTONE	I do truly for thou swearest to me thou art
	honest now if thou wert a poet I might have some
	hope thou didst feign

AUDREY	Would you not have me honest?

TOUCHSTONE	No truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for
	honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar

JAQUES	Aside  A material fool

AUDREY	 Well I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods
	make me honest

TOUCHSTONE	Truly and to cast away honesty upon a fouO HOFG
