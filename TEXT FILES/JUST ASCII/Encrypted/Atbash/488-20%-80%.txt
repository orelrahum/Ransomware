Kuwait Economy

Overview
    Up to the invasion by Iraq in August  the oil sector had dominated the
    economy Kuwait has the thirdlargest oil reserves in the world after Saudi
    Arabia and Iraq Earnings from hydrocarbons have generated over  of both
    export and government revenues and contributed about  to GDP Most of the
    nonoil sector has traditionally been dependent upon oilderived government
    revenues Iraqs destruction of Kuwaits oil industry during the Gulf war
    has devastated the economy Iraq destroyed or damaged more than  of
    Kuwaits  operating oil wells as well as sabotaged key surface
    facilities Firefighters brought all of the roughly  oil well fires and
    blowouts under control by November  By yearend production had been
    brought back to  barrels per day it could take two to three years to
    restore Kuwaits oil production to its prewar level of about  million
    barrels per day Meanwhile population had been greatly reduced because of
    the war from  million to  million
