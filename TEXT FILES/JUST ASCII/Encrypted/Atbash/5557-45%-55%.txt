And season him thy last and sweetest prey
This said they both betook them several ways
Both to destroy or unimmortal make
All kinds and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later which the Almighty seeing
From his transcendent seat the Saints among
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice
See with what heat these dogs of Hell advance
To waste and havock yonder world which I
So fair and good created and had still
Kept in that state had not the folly of Man
Let in these wasteful furies who impute
Folly to me so doth the Prince of Hell
And his adherents that with so much ease
I suffer them to enter and possess
A place so heavenly and conniving seem
To gratify my scornful enemies
That laugh as if transported with some fit
Of passion I to them had quitted all
At random yielded up to their misrule
And know not that I called and drew them thither
My Hellhounds to lick up the draff and filth
Which Mans polluting sin with taint hath shed
On what was pure til crammed and gorged nigh burst
With sucked and glutted offal at one sling
Of thy victorious arm wellpleasing Son
Both Sin and Death and yawning Grave at last
Through Chaos hurled obstruct the mouth of Hell
For ever and seal up his ravenous jaws
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure
To sanctity that shall receive no stain
Till then the curse pronounced on both precedes
He ended and the heavenly audience loud
Sung Halleluiah as the sound of seas
Through multitude that sung  Just are thy ways
Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works
Who can extenuate thee?  Next to the Son
Destined Restorer of mankind by whom
New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise
Or down from Heaven descendSuch was their song
While the Creator calling forth by name
His mighty Angels gave them several charge
As sorted best with present things  The sun
Had first his precept so to move so shine
As might affect the earth with cold and heat
Scarce tolerable and from the north to call
Decrepit winter from the south to bring
Solstitial summers heat  To the blanc moon
Her office they prescribed to the other five
Their planetary motions and aspects
In sextile square and trine and opposite
Of noxious efficacy and when to join
In synod unbenign and taught the fixed
Their influence malignant when to shower
Which of them rising with the sun or falling
Should prove tempestuous  To the winds they set
Their corners when with bluster to confound
Sea air and shore the thunder when to roll
With terrour through the dark aereal hall
Some say he bid his Angels turn ascanse
The poles of earth twice ten degrees and more
From the suns axle they with labour pushed
Oblique the centrick globe  Some say the sun
Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven
Atlantick Sisters and the Spartan Twins
Up to the Tropick Crab thence down amain
By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales
As deep as Capricorn to bring in change
Of seasons to each clime else had the spring
Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers
Equal in days and nights except to those
Beyond the polar circles to them day
Had unbenighted shone while the low sun
To recompense his distance in their sight
Had rounded still the horizon and not known
Or east or west which had forbid the snow
From cold Estotiland and south as far
Beneath Magellan  At that tasted fruit
The sun as from Thyestean banquet turned
His course intended else how had the world
Inhabited though sinless more than now
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?
These changes in the Heavens though slow produced
Like change on sea and land sideral blast
Vapour and mist and exhalation hot
Corrupt and pestilent  Now from the north
Of Norumbega and the Samoed shore
Bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice
And snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw
Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud
And Thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn
With adverse blast upturns them from the south
Notus and Afer black with thunderous clouds
From Serraliona thwart of these as fierce
Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds
Eurus and Zephyr with their lateral noise
Sirocco and Libecchio  Thus began
Outrage from lifeless things but Discord first
Daughter of Sin among the irrational
Death introduced through fierce antipathy
Beast now with beast gan war and fowl with fowl
And fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving
Devoured each other nor stood much in awe
Of Man but fled him or with countenance grim
Glared on him passing  These were from without
The growing miseries which Adam saw
Already in part though hid in gloomiest shade
To sorrow abandoned but worse felt within
And in a troubled sea of passion tost
Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint
O miserable of happy  Is this the end
Of this new glorious world and me so late
The glory of that glory who now become
Accursed of blessed? hide me from the face
Of God whom to behold was then my highth
Of happinessYet well if here would end
The misery I deserved it and would bear
My own deservings but this will not serve
All that I eat or drink or shall beget
Is propagated curse  O voice once heard
Delightfully Encrease and multiply
Now death to hear for what can I encrease
Or multiply but curses on my head?
Who of all ages to succeed but feeling
The evil on him brought by me will curse
My head?  Ill fare our ancestor impure
For this we may thank Adam but his thanks
Shall be the execration so besides
Mine own that bide upon me all from me
Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound
On me as on their natural center light
Heavy though in their place  O fleeting joys
Of Paradise dear bought with lasting woes
Did I request thee Maker from my clay
To mould me Man? did I solicit thee
From darkness to promote me or here place
In this delicious garden?  As my will
Concurred not to my being it were but right
And equal to reduce me to my dust
Desirous to resign and render back
All I received unable to perform
Thy terms too hard by which I was to hold
The good I sought not  To the loss of that
Sufficient penalty why hast thou added
The sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable
Why am I mocked with death and lengthened out
To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet
Mortality my sentence and be earth
Insensible  How glad would lay me down
As in my mothers lap  There I should rest
And sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
Would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
To me and to my offspring would torment me
With cruel expectation  Yet one doubt
Pursues me still lest all I cannot die
Lest that pure breath of life the spirit of Man
Which God inspired cannot together perish
With this corporeal clod then in the grave
Or in some other dismal place who knows
But I shall die a living death?  O thought
Horrid if true  Yet why? It was but breath
Of life that sinned what dies but what had life
And sin?  The body properly had neither
All of me then shall die let this appease
The doubt since human reach no further knows
For though the Lord of all be infinite
Is his wrath also?  Be it Man is not so
But mortal doomed  How can he exercise
Wrath without end on Man whom death must end?
Can he make deathless death?  That were to make
Strange contradiction which to God himself
Impossible is held as argument
Of weakness not of power  Will he draw out
For angers sake finite to infinite
In punished Man to satisfy his rigour
Satisfied never?  That were to extend
His sentence beyond dust and Natures law
By which all causes else according still
To the reception of their matter act
Not to the extent of their own sphere  But say
That death be not one stroke as I supposed
Bereaving sense but endless misery
From this day onward which I feel begun
Both in me and without me and so last
To perpetuityAy methat fear
Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution
On my defenceless head both Death and I
Am found eternal and incorporate both
Nor I on my part single in me all
Posterity stands cursed  Fair patrimony
That I must leave ye Sons  O were I able
To waste it all myself and leave ye none
So disinherited how would you bless
Me now your curse  Ah why should all mankind
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemned
It guiltless?  But from me what can proceed
But all corrupt both mind and will depraved
Not to do only but to will the same
With me?  How can they then acquitted stand
In sight of God?  Him after all disputes
Forced I absolve all my evasions vain
And reasonings though through mazes lead me still
But to my own conviction first and last
On me me only as the source and spring
Of all corruption all the blame lights due
So might the wrath  Fond wishcouldst thou support
That burden heavier than the earth to bear
Than all the world much heavier though divided
With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desirest
And what thou fearest alike destroys all hope
Of refuge and concludes thee miserable
Beyond all past example and future
To Satan only like both crime and doom
O Conscience into what abyss of fears
And horrours hast thou driven me out of which
I find no way from deep to deeper plunged
Thus Adam to himself lamented loud
Through the still night not now as ere Man fell
Wholesome and cool and mild but with black air
Accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom
Which to his evil conscience represented
All things with double terrour  On the ground
Outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft
Cursed his creation  Death as oft accused
Of tardy execution since denounced
The day of his offence  Why comes not Death
Said he with one thriceacceptable stroke
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word
Justice Divine not hasten to be just?
But Death comes not at call Justice Divine
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries
O woods O fountains hillocks dales and bowers
With other echo late I taught your shades
To answer and resound far other song
Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld
Desolate where she sat approaching nigh
Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed
But her with stern regard he thus repelled
Out of my sight thou Serpent  That name best
Befits thee with him leagued thyself as false
And hateful nothing wants but that thy shape
Like his and colour serpentine may show
Thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
Henceforth lest that too heavenly form pretended
To hellish falshood snare them  But for thee
I had persisted happy had not thy pride
And wandering vanity when least was safe
Rejected my forewarning and disdained
Not to be trusted longing to be seen
Though by the Devil himself him overweening
To overreach but with the serpent meeting
Fooled and beguiled by him thou I by thee
To trust thee from my side imagined wise
Constant mature proof against all assaults
And understood not all was but a show
Rather than solid virtue all but a rib
Crooked by nature bent as now appears
More to the part sinister from me drawn
Well if thrown out as supernumerary
To my just number found  O why did God
Creator wise that peopled highest Heaven
With Spirits masculine create at last
This novelty on earth this fair defect
Of nature and not fill the world at once
With Men as Angels without feminine
Or find some other way to generate
Mankind?  This mischief had not been befallen
And more that shall befall innumerable
Disturbances on earth through female snares
And strait conjunction with this sex for either
He never shall find out fit mate but such
As some misfortune brings him or mistake
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
Through her perverseness but shall see her gained
By a far worse or if she love withheld
By parents or his happiest choice too late
Shall meet already linked and wedlockbound
To a fell adversary his hate or shame
Which infinite calamity shall cause
To human life and houshold peace confound
He added not and from her turned but Eve
Not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing
And tresses all disordered at his feet
Fell humble and embracing them besought
His peace and thus proceeded in her plaint
Forsake me not thus Adam witness Heaven
What love sincere and reverence in my heart
I bear thee and unweeting have offended
Unhappily deceived  Thy suppliant
I beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not
Whereon I live thy gentle looks thy aid
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress
My only strength and stay  Forlorn of thee
Whither shall I betake me where subsist?
While yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps
Between us two let there be peace both joining
As joined in injuries one enmity
Against a foe by doom express assigned us
That cruel Serpent  On me exercise not
Thy hatred for this misery befallen
On me already lost me than thyself
More miserable  Both have sinnedbut thou
Against God only I against God and thee
And to the place of judgement will return
There with my cries importune Heaven that all
The sentence from thy head removed may light
On me sole cause to thee of all this woe
Me me only just object of his ire
She ended weeping and her lowly plight
Immoveable till peace obtained from fault
Acknowledged and deplored in Adam wrought
Commiseration  Soon his heart relented
Towards her his life so late and sole delight
Now at his feet submissive in distress
Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking
His counsel whom she had displeased his aid
As one disarmed his anger all he lost
And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon
Unwary and too desirous as before
So now of what thou knowest not who desirest
The punishment all on thyself alas
Bear thine own first ill able to sustain
His full wrath whose thou feelest as yet least part
And my displeasure bearest so ill  If prayers
Could alter high decrees I to that place
Would speed before thee and be louder heard
That on my head all might be visited
Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven
To me committed and by me exposed
But riselet us no more contend nor blame
Each other blamed enough elsewhere but strive
In offices of love how we may lighten
Each others burden in our share of woe
Since this days death denounced if aught I see
Will prove no sudden but a slowpaced evil
A long days dying to augment our pain
And to our seed O hapless seed derived
To whom thus Eve recovering heart replied
Adam by sad experiment I know
How little weight my words with thee can find
Found so erroneous thence by just event
Found so unfortunate  Nevertheless
Restored by thee vile as I am to place
Of new acceptance hopeful to regain
Thy love the sole contentment of my heart
Living or dying from thee I will not hide
What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen
Tending to some relief of our extremes
Or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable
As in our evils and of easier choice
If care of our descent perplex us most
Which must be born to certain woe devoured
By Death at last and miserable it is
To be to others cause of misery
Our own begotten and of our loins to bring
Into this cursed world a woeful race
That after wretched life must be at last
Food for so foul a monster in thy power
It lies yet ere conception to prevent
The race unblest to being yet unbegot
Childless thou art childless remain so Death
Shall be deceived his glut and with us two
Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw
But if thou judge it hard and difficult
Conversing looking loving to abstain
From loves due rights nuptial embraces sweet
And with desire to languish without hope
Before the present object languishing
With like desire which would be misery
And torment less than none of what we dread
Then both ourselves and seed at once to free
From what we fear for both let us make short 
Let us seek Death  or he not found supply
With our own hands his office on ourselves
Why stand we longer shivering under fears
That show no end but death and have the power
Of many ways to die the shortest choosing
Destruction with destruction to destroy? 
She ended here or vehement despair
Broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts
Had entertained as dyed her cheeks with pale
But Adam with such counsel nothing swayed
To better hopes his more attentive mind
Labouring had raised and thus to Eve replied
Eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
To argue in thee something more sublime
And excellent than what thy mind contemns
But selfdestruction therefore sought refutes
That excellence thought in thee and implies
Not thy contempt but anguish and regret
For loss of life and pleasure overloved
Or if thou covet death as utmost end
Of misery so thinking to evade
The penalty pronounced doubt not but God
Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire than so
To be forestalled much more I fear lest death
So snatched will not exempt us from the pain
We are by doom to pay rather such acts
Of contumacy will provoke the Highest
To make death in us live  Then let us seek
Some safer resolution which methinks
I have in view calling to mind with heed
Part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise
The Serpents head piteous amends unless
Be meant whom I conjecture our grand foe
Satan who in the serpent hath contrived
Against us this deceit  To crush his head
Would be revenge indeed which will be lost
By death brought on ourselves or childless days
Resolved as thou proposest so our foe
Shal scape his punishment ordained and we
Instead shall double ours upon our heads
No more be mentioned then of violence
Against ourselves and wilful barrenness
That cuts us off from hope and savours only
Rancour and pride impatience and despite
Reluctance against God and his just yoke
Laid on our necks  Remember with what mild
And gracious temper he both heard and judged
Without wrath or reviling we expected
Immediate dissolution which we thought
Was meant by death that day when loto thee
