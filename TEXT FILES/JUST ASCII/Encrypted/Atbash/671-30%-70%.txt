  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great
or small  Off with his head she said without even looking
round

  Ill fetch the executioner myself said the King eagerly and
he hurried off

  Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game
was going on as she heard the Queens voice in the distance
screaming with passion  She had already heard her sentence three
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and
she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in
such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or
not  So she went in search of her hedgehog

  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one
of them with the other  the only difficulty was that her
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
into a tree

  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back
the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight
but it doesnt matter much thought Alice as all the arches
are gone from this side of the ground  So she tucked it away
under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for
a little more conversation with her friend

  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to
find quite a large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute
going on between the executioner the King and the Queen who
were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent
and looked very uncomfortable

  The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to
settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her
though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed
to make out exactly what they said

  The executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a
head unless there was a body to cut it off from  that he had
never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin
at HIS time of life

  The Kings argument was that anything that had a head could be
beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense

  The Queens argument was that if something wasnt done about
it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round
It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so
grave and anxious

  Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the
Duchess  youd better ask HER about it

  Shes in prison the Queen said to the executioner  fetch
her here  And the executioner went off like an arrow

   The Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and
by the time he had come back with the Dutchess it had entirely
disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and
down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game



                           CHAPTER IX

                     The Mock Turtles Story


  You cant think how glad I am to see you again you dear old
thing said the Duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately
into Alices and they walked off together

  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen

  When IM a Duchess she said to herself not in a very
hopeful tone though I wont have any pepper in my kitchen AT
ALL  Soup does very well withoutMaybe its always pepper that
makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at
having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them
sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar
and such things that make children sweettempered  I only wish
people knew that  then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you
know

  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time and was a
little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear
Youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you
forget to talk  I cant tell you just now what the moral of that
is but I shall remember it in a bit

  Perhaps it hasnt one Alice ventured to remark

  Tut tut child said the Duchess  Everythings got a
moral if only you can find it  And she squeezed herself up
closer to Alices side as she spoke

  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her  first
because the Duchess was VERY ugly and secondly because she was
exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alices shoulder
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin  However she did not
like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could

  The games going on rather better now she said by way of
keeping up the conversation a little

  Tis so said the Duchess  and the moral of that is"Oh
tis love tis love that makes the world go round"

  Somebody said Alice whispered that its done by everybody
minding their own business

  Ah well  It means much the same thing said the Duchess
digging her sharp little chin into Alices shoulder as she added
and the moral of THAT is"Take care of the sense and the
sounds will take care of themselves"

  How fond she is of finding morals in things Alice thought to
herself

  I dare say youre wondering why I dont put my arm round your
waist the Duchess said after a pause  the reason is that Im
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo  Shall I try the
experiment?

  HE might bite Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all
anxious to have the experiment tried

  Very true said the Duchess  flamingoes and mustard both
bite  And the moral of that is"Birds of a feather flock
together"

  Only mustard isnt a bird Alice remarked

  Right as usual said the Duchess  what a clear way you
have of putting things

  Its a mineral I THINK said Alice

  Of course it is said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree
to everything that Alice said theres a large mustardmine near
here  And the moral of that is"The more there is of mine the
less there is of yours"

  Oh I know exclaimed Alice who had not attended to this
last remark its a vegetable  It doesnt look like one but it
is

  I quite agree with you said the Duchess and the moral of
that is"Be what you would seem to be"or if youd like it put
more simply"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than
what it might appear to others that what you were or might have
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared
to them to be otherwise"

  I think I should understand that better Alice said very
politely if I had it written down  but I cant quite follow it
as you say it

  Thats nothing to what I could say if I chose the Duchess
replied in a pleased tone

  Pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that
said Alice

  Oh dont talk about trouble said the Duchess  I make you
a present of everything Ive said as yet

  A cheap sort of present thought Alice  Im glad they dont
give birthday presents like that  But she did not venture to
say it out loud

  Thinking again? the Duchess asked with another dig of her
sharp little chin

  Ive a right to think said Alice sharply for she was
beginning to feel a little worried

  Just about as much right said the Duchess as pigs have to
fly and the m

  But here to Alices great surprise the Duchesss voice died
away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble  Alice looked up
and there stood the Queen in front of them with her arms folded
frowning like a thunderstorm

  A fine day your Majesty the Duchess began in a low weak
voice

  Now I give you fair warning shouted the Queen stamping on
the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off
and that in about half no time  Take your choice

  The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment

  Lets go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and Alice
was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her
back to the croquetground

  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queens absence
and were resting in the shade  however the moment they saw her
they hurried back to the game the Queen merely remarking that a
moments delay would cost them their lives

  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off
quarrelling with the other players and shouting Off with his
head or Off with her head  Those whom she sentenced were
taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave
off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour
or so there were no arches left and all the players except the
King the Queen and Alice were in custody and under sentence of
execution

  Then the Queen left off quite out of breath and said to
Alice Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?

  No said Alice  I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is

  Its the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from said the Queen

  I never saw one or heard of one said Alice

  Come on then said the Queen and he shall tell you his
history

  As they walked off together Alice heard the King say in a low
voice to the company generally You are all pardoned  Come
THATS a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite
unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered

  They very soon came upon a Gryphon lying fast asleep in the
sun  IF you dont know what a Gryphon is look at the picture
Up lazy thing said the Queen and take this young lady to
see the Mock Turtle and to hear his history  I must go back and
see after some executions I have ordered and she walked off
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon  Alice did not quite like
the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would
be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
Queen  so she waited

  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the
Queen till she was out of sight  then it chuckled  What fun
said the Gryphon half to itself half to Alice

  What IS the fun? said Alice

  Why SHE said the Gryphon  Its all her fancy that  they
never executes nobody you know  Come on

  Everybody says "come on" here thought Alice as she went
slowly after it  I never was so ordered about in all my life
never

  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the
distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and
as they came nearer Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart
would break  She pitied him deeply  What is his sorrow? she
asked the Gryphon and the Gryphon answered very nearly in the
same words as before Its all his fancy that  he hasnt got
no sorrow you know  Come on

  So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with
large eyes full of tears but said nothing

  This here young lady said the Gryphon she wants for to
know your history she do

  Ill tell it her said the Mock Turtle in a deep hollow
tone  sit down both of you and dont speak a word till Ive
finished

  So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes  Alice
thought to herself I dont see how he can EVEN finish if he
doesnt begin  But she waited patiently

  Once said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh I was
a real Turtle

  These words were followed by a very long silence broken only
by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh from the Gryphon and
the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle  Alice was very
nearly getting up and saying Thank you sir for your
interesting story but she could not help thinking there MUST be
more to come so she sat still and said nothing

  When we were little the Mock Turtle went on at last more
calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to
school in the sea  The master was an old Turtlewe used to call
him Tortoise

  Why did you call him Tortoise if he wasnt one? Alice asked

  We called him Tortoise because he taught us said the Mock
Turtle angrily  really you are very dull

  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and
looked at poor Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth  At
last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle Drive on old fellow
Dont be all day about it and he went on in these words

  Yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe
it

  I never said I didnt interrupted Alice

  You did said the Mock Turtle

  Hold your tongue added the Gryphon before Alice could speak
again  The Mock Turtle went on

  We had the best of educationsin fact we went to school
every day

  IVE been to a dayschool too said Alice you neednt be
so proud as all that

  With extras? asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously

  Yes said Alice we learned French and music

  And washing? said the Mock Turtle

  Certainly not said Alice indignantly

  Ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the Mock
Turtle in a tone of great relief  Now at OURS they had at the
end of the bill "French music AND WASHINGextra"

  You couldnt have wanted it much said Alice living at the
bottom of the sea

  I couldnt afford to learn it said the Mock Turtle with a
sigh  I only took the regular course
