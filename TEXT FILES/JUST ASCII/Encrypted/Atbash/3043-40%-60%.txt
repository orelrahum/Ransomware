ACT V



SCENE IV	The forest


	Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS JAQUES ORLANDO OLIVER
	and CELIA

DUKE SENIOR	Dost thou believe Orlando that the boy
	Can do all this that he hath promised?

ORLANDO	I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not
	As those that fear they hope and know they fear

	Enter ROSALIND SILVIUS and PHEBE

ROSALIND	Patience once more whiles our compact is urged
	You say if I bring in your Rosalind
	You will bestow her on Orlando here?

DUKE SENIOR	That would I had I kingdoms to give with her

ROSALIND	And you say you will have her when I bring her?

ORLANDO	That would I were I of all kingdoms king

ROSALIND	You say youll marry me if I be willing?

PHEBE	That will I should I die the hour after

ROSALIND	But if you do refuse to marry me
	Youll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

PHEBE	So is the bargain

ROSALIND	You say that youll have Phebe if she will?

SILVIUS	Though to have her and death were both one thing

ROSALIND	I have promised to make all this matter even
	Keep you your word O duke to give your daughter
	You yours Orlando to receive his daughter
	Keep your word Phebe that youll marry me
	Or else refusing me to wed this shepherd
	Keep your word Silvius that youll marry her
	If she refuse me and from hence I go
	To make these doubts all even

	Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

DUKE SENIOR	I do remember in this shepherd boy
	Some lively touches of my daughters favour

ORLANDO	My lord the first time that I ever saw him
	Methought he was a brother to your daughter
	But my good lord this boy is forestborn
	And hath been tutord in the rudiments
	Of many desperate studies by his uncle
	Whom he reports to be a great magician
	Obscured in the circle of this forest

	Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

JAQUES	There is sure another flood toward and these
	couples are coming to the ark Here comes a pair of
	very strange beasts which in all tongues are called fools

TOUCHSTONE	Salutation and greeting to you all

JAQUES	Good my lord bid him welcome this is the
	motleyminded gentleman that I have so often met in
	the forest he hath been a courtier he swears

TOUCHSTONE	If any man doubt that let him put me to my
	purgation I have trod a measure I have flattered
	a lady I have been politic with my friend smooth
	with mine enemy I have undone three tailors I have
	had four quarrels and like to have fought one

JAQUES	And how was that taen up?

TOUCHSTONE	Faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the
	seventh cause

JAQUES	How seventh cause? Good my lord like this fellow

DUKE SENIOR	I like him very well

TOUCHSTONE	God ild you sir I desire you of the like I
	press in here sir amongst the rest of the country
	copulatives to swear and to forswear according as
	marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin
	sir an illfavoured thing sir but mine own a poor
	humour of mine sir to take that that no man else
	will rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a
	poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster

DUKE SENIOR	By my faith he is very swift and sententious

TOUCHSTONE	According to the fools bolt sir and such dulcet diseases

JAQUES	But for the seventh cause how did you find the
	quarrel on the seventh cause?

TOUCHSTONE	Upon a lie seven times removedbear your body more
	seeming Audreyas thus sir I did dislike the
	cut of a certain courtiers beard he sent me word
	if I said his beard was not cut well he was in the
	mind it was this is called the Retort Courteous
	If I sent him word again it was not well cut he
	would send me word he cut it to please himself
	this is called the Quip Modest If again it was
	not well cut he disabled my judgment this is
	called the Reply Churlish If again it was not
	well cut he would answer I spake not true this
	is called the Reproof Valiant If again it was not
	well cut he would say I lied this is called the
	Countercheque Quarrelsome and so to the Lie
	Circumstantial and the Lie Direct

JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial
	nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct and so we
	measured swords and parted

JAQUES	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?

TOUCHSTONE	O sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have
	books for good manners I will name you the degrees
	The first the Retort Courteous the second the
	Quip Modest the third the Reply Churlish the
	fourth the Reproof Valiant the fifth the
	Countercheque Quarrelsome the sixth the Lie with
	Circumstance the seventh the Lie Direct All
	these you may avoid but the Lie Direct and you may
	avoid that too with an If I knew when seven
	justices could not take up a quarrel but when the
	parties were met themselves one of them thought but
	of an If as If you said so then I said so and
	they shook hands and swore brothers Your If is the
	only peacemaker much virtue in If

JAQUES	Is not this a rare fellow my lord? hes as good at
	any thing and yet a fool

DUKE SENIOR	He uses his folly like a stalkinghorse and under
	the presentation of that he shoots his wit

	Enter HYMEN ROSALIND and CELIA

	Still Music

HYMEN	        Then is there mirth in heaven
	When earthly things made even
	Atone together
	Good duke receive thy daughter
	Hymen from heaven brought her
	Yea brought her hither
	That thou mightst join her hand with his
	Whose heart within his bosom is

ROSALIND	To DUKE SENIOR  To you I give myself for I am yours

	To ORLANDO

	To you I give myself for I am yours

DUKE SENIOR	If there be truth in sight you are my daughter

ORLANDO	If there be truth in sight you are my Rosalind

PHEBE	If sight and shape be true
	Why then my love adieu

ROSALIND	Ill have no father if you be not he
	Ill have no husband if you be not he
	Nor neer wed woman if you be not she

HYMEN	        Peace ho I bar confusion
	Tis I must make conclusion
	Of these most strange events
	Heres eight that must take hands
	To join in Hymens bands
	If truth holds true contents
	You and you no cross shall part
	You and you are heart in heart
	You to his love must accord
	Or have a woman to your lord
	You and you are sure together
	As the winter to foul weather
	Whiles a wedlockhymn we sing
	Feed yourselves with questioning
	That reason wonder may diminish
	How thus we met and these things finish

	SONG
	Wedding is great Junos crown
	O blessed bond of board and bed
	Tis Hymen peoples every town
	High wedlock then be honoured
	Honour high honour and renown
	To Hymen god of every town

DUKE SENIOR	O my dear niece welcome thou art to me
	Even daughter welcome in no less degree

PHEBE	I will not eat my word now thou art mine
	Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine

	Enter JAQUES DE BOYS

JAQUES DE BOYS	Let me have audience for a word or two
	I am the second son of old Sir Rowland
	That bring these tidings to this fair assembly
	Duke Frederick hearing how that every day
	Men of great worth resorted to this forest
	Addressd a mighty power which were on foot
	In his own conduct purposely to take
	His brother here and put him to the sword
	And to the skirts of this wild wood he came
	Where meeting with an old religious man
	After some question with him was converted
	Both from his enterprise and from the world
	His crown bequeathing to his banishd brother
	And all their lands restored to them again
	That were with him exiled This to be true
	I do engage my life

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome young man
	Thou offerst fairly to thy brothers wedding
	To one his lands withheld and to the other
	A land itself at large a potent dukedom
	First in this forest let us do those ends
	That here were well begun and well begot
	And after every of this happy number
	That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
	Shall share the good of our returned fortune
	According to the measure of their states
	Meantime forget this newfalln dignity
	And fall into our rustic revelry
	Play music And you brides and bridegrooms all
	With measure heapd in joy to the measures fall

JAQUES	Sir by your patience If I heard you rightly
	The duke hath put on a religious life
	And thrown into neglect the pompous court?

JAQUES DE BOYS	He hath

JAQUES	To him will I  out of these convertites
	There is much matter to be heard and learnd

	To DUKE SENIOR

	You to your former honour I bequeath
	Your patience and your virtue well deserves it

	To ORLANDO

	You to a love that your true faith doth merit

	To OLIVER

	You to your land and love and great allies

	To SILVIUS

	You to a long and welldeserved bed

	To TOUCHSTONE

	And you to wrangling for thy loving voyage
	Is but for two months victualld So to your pleasures
	I am for other than for dancing measures

DUKE SENIOR	Stay Jaques stay

JAQUES	To see no pastime I	what you would have
	Ill stay to know at your abandond cave

	Exit

DUKE SENIOR	Proceed proceed we will begin these rites
	As we do trust theyll end in true delights

	A dance




	AS YOU LIKE IT

	EPILOGUE


ROSALIND	It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue
	but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
	the prologue If it be true that good wine needs
	no bush tis true that a good play needs no
	epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes
	and good plays prove the better by the help of good
	epilogues What a case am I in then that am
	neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
	you in the behalf of a good play I am not
	furnished like a beggar therefore to beg will not
	become me my way is to conjure you and Ill begin
	with the women I charge you O women for the love
	you bear to men to like as much of this play as
	please you and I charge you O men for the love
	you bear to womenas I perceive by your simpering
	none of you hates themthat between you and the
	women the play may please If I were a woman I
	would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
	me complexions that liked me and breaths that I
	defied not and I am sure as many as have good
	beards or good faces or sweet breaths will for my
	kind offer when I make curtsy bid me farewell

I would like to thank Carl Fleischhauer and Prosser Gifford for the
opportunity to learn about areas of human activity unknown to me a scant
ten months ago and the David and Lucile Packard Foundation for
supporting that opportunity  The help given by others is acknowledged on
a separate page

                              INTRODUCTION

The Workshop on Electronic Texts  drew together representatives of
various projects and interest groups to compare ideas beliefs
experiences and in particular methods of placing and presenting
historical textual materials in computerized form  Most attendees gained
much in insight and outlook from the event  But the assembly did not
form a new nation or to put it another way the diversity of projects
and interests was too great to draw the representatives into a cohesive
actionoriented body

Everyone attending the Workshop shared an interest in preserving and
providing access to historical texts  But within this broad field the
attendees represented a variety of formal informal figurative and
literal groups with many individuals belonging to more than one  These
groups may be defined roughly according to the following topics or
activities

 Imaging
 Searchable coded texts
 National and international computer networks
 CDROM production and dissemination
 Methods and technology for converting older paper materials into
electronic form
 Study of the use of digital materials by scholars and others

This summary is arranged thematically and does not follow the actual
sequence of presentations

NOTES
       In this document the phrase electronic text is used to mean
     any computerized reproduction or version of a document book
     article or manuscript including images and not merely a machine
     readable or machinesearchable text

       The Workshop was held at the Library of Congress on  June
      with funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation
     The document that follows represents a summary of the presentations
     made at the Workshop and was compiled by James DALY  This
     introduction was written by DALY and Carl FLEISCHHAUER


PRESERVATION AND IMAGING

Preservation as that term is used by archivists was most explicitly
discussed in the context of imaging  Anne KENNEY and Lynne PERSONIUS
explained how the concept of a faithful copy and the userfriendliness of
the traditional book have guided their project at Cornell University
Although interested in computerized dissemination participants in the
Cornell project are creating digital image sets of older books in the
public domain as a source for a fresh paper facsimile or in a future
phase microfilm  The books returned to the library shelves are
highquality and useful replacements on acidfree paper that should last
a long time  To date the Cornell project has placed little or no
emphasis on creating searchable texts one would not be surprised to find
that the project participants view such texts as new editions and thus
not as faithful reproductions

In her talk on preservation Patricia BATTIN struck an ecumenical and
flexible note as she endorsed the creation and dissemination of a variety
of types of digital copies  Do not be too narrow in defining what counts
as a preservation element BATTIN counseled for the present at least
digital copies made with preservation in mind cannot be as narrowly
standardized as say microfilm copies with the same objective  Setting
standards precipitously can inhibit creativity but delay can result in
chaos she advised

In part BATTINs position reflected the unsettled nature of imageformat
standards and attendees could hear echoes of this unsettledness in the
comments of various speakers  For example Jean BARONAS reviewed the
status of several formal standards moving through committees of experts
and Clifford LYNCH encouraged the use of a new guideline for transmitting
document images on Internet  Testimony from participants in the National
Agricultural Librarys NAL Text Digitization Program and LCs American
Memory project highlighted some of the challenges to the actual creation
or interchange of images including difficulties in converting
preservation microfilm to digital form  Donald WATERS reported on the
progress of a master plan for a project at Yale University to convert
books on microfilm to digital image sets Project Open Book POB

The Workshop offered rather less of an imaging practicum than planned
but "howto" hints emerge at various points for example throughout
KENNEYs presentation and in the discussion of arcana such as
thresholding and dithering offered by George THOMA and FLEISCHHAUER

NOTES
       Although there is a sense in which any reproductions of
     historical materials preserve the human record specialists in the
     field have developed particular guidelines for the creation of
     acceptable preservation copies

     beginning of their respective talks and in the Directory of
     Participants Appendix III


THE MACHINEREADABLE TEXT  MARKUP AND USE

The sections of the Workshop that dealt with machinereadable text tended
to be more concerned with access and use than with preservation at least
in the narrow technical sense  Michael SPERBERGMcQUEEN made a forceful
presentation on the Text Encoding Initiatives TEI implementation of
the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML  His ideas were echoed
by Susan HOCKEY Elli MYLONAS and Stuart WEIBEL  While the
presentations made by the TEI advocates contained no practicum their
discussion focused on the value of the finished product what the
European Community calls reusability but what may also be termed
durability  They argued that marking upthat is codinga text in a
wellconceived way will permit it to be moved from one computer
environment to another as well as to be used by various users  Two
kinds of markup were distinguished   procedural markup which
describes the features of a text eg dots on a page and 
descriptive markup which describes the structure or elements of a
document eg chapters paragraphs and front matter

The TEI proponents emphasized the importance of texts to scholarship
They explained how heavily coded and thus analyzed and annotated texts
can underlie research play a role in scholarly communication and
facilitate classroom teaching  SPERBERGMcQUEEN reminded listeners that
a written or printed item eg a particular edition of a book is
merely a representation of the abstraction we call a text  To concern
ourselves with faithfully reproducing a printed instance of the text
SPERBERGMcQUEEN argued is to concern ourselves with the representation
of a representation "images as simulacra for the text"  The TEI proponents
interest in images tends to focus on corollary materials for use in teaching
for example photographs of the Acropolis to accompany a Greek text

By the end of the Workshop SPERBERGMcQUEEN confessed to having been
converted to a limited extent to the view that electronic images
constitute a promising alternative to microfilming indeed an
alternative probably superior to microfilming  But he was not convinced
that electronic images constitute a serious attempt to represent text in
electronic form  HOCKEY and MYLONAS also conceded that their experience
at the Pierce Symposium the previous week at Georgetown University and
the present conference at the Library of Congress had compelled them to
reevaluate their perspective on the usefulness of text as images
Attendees could see that the text and image advocates were in
constructive tension so to say

Three nonTEI presentations described approaches to preparing
machinereadable text that are less rigorous and thus less expensive  In
the case of the Papers of George Washington Dorothy TWOHIG explained
that the digital version will provide a notquiteperfect rendering of
the transcribed textsome  documents available for research
during the decades while the perfect or print version is completed
Members of the American Memory team and the staff of NALs Text
Digitization Program see below also outlined a middle ground concerning
searchable texts  In the case of American Memory contractors produce
texts with about percent accuracy that serve as "browse" or
"reference" versions of written or printed originals  End users who need
faithful copies or perfect renditions must refer to accompanying sets of
digital facsimile images or consult copies of the originals in a nearby
library or archive  American Memory staff argued that the high cost of
producing percent accurate copies would prevent LC from offering
access to large parts of its collections


THE MACHINEREADABLE TEXT  METHODS OF CONVERSION

Although the Workshop did not include a systematic examination of the
methods for converting texts from paper or from facsimile images into
machinereadable form nevertheless various speakers touched upon this
matter  For example WEIBEL reported that OCLC has experimented with a
merging of multiple optical character recognition systems that will
reduce errors from an unacceptable rate of  characters out of every
l to an unacceptable rate of  characters out of every l

Pamela ANDRE presented an overview of NALs Text Digitization Program and
Judith ZIDAR discussed the technical details  ZIDAR explained how NAL
purchased hardware and software capable of performing optical character
recognition OCR and text conversion and used its own staff to convert
texts  The process ZIDAR said required extensive editing and project
staff found themselves considering alternatives including rekeying
andor creating abstracts or summaries of texts  NAL reckoned costs at
 per page  By way of contrast Ricky ERWAY explained that American
Memory had decided from the start to contract out conversion to external
service bureaus  The criteria used to select these contractors were cost
and quality of results as opposed to methods of conversion  ERWAY noted
that historical documents or books often do not lend themselves to OCR
Bound materials represent a special problem  In her experience quality
controlinspecting incoming materials counting errors in samplesposed
the most timeconsuming aspect of contracting out conversion  ERWAY
reckoned American Memorys costs at  per page but cautioned that fewer
costelements had been included than in NALs figure


OPTIONS FOR DISSEMINATION

The topic of dissemination proper emerged at various points during the
Workshop  At the session devoted to national and international computer
networks LYNCH Howard BESSER Ronald LARSEN and Edwin BROWNRIGG
highlighted the virtues of Internet today and of the network that will
evolve from Internet  Listeners could discern in these narratives a
vision of an information democracy in which millions of citizens freely
find and use what they need  LYNCH noted that a lack of standards
inhibits disseminating multimedia on the network a topic also discussed
by BESSER  LARSEN addressed the issues of network scalability and
modularity and commented upon the difficulty of anticipating the effects
of growth in orders of magnitude  BROWNRIGG talked about the ability of
packet radio to provide certain links in a network without the need for
wiring  However the presenters also called attention to the
shortcomings and incongruities of presentday computer networks  For
example   Network use is growing dramatically but much network
traffic consists of personal communication Email   Large bodies of
information are available but a users ability to search across their
entirety is limited   There are significant resources for science and
technology but few network sources provide content in the humanities
 Machinereadable texts are commonplace but the capability of the
system to deal with images let alone other media foINZGH OZTH YVSRMW
