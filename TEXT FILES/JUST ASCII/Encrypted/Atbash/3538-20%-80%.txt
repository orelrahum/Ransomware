Egypt Economy

Overview
    Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
    economies most industrial plants being owned by the government
    Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment
    Even so the economy grew rapidly during the late s and early s but
    in  the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
    debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
    balanceofpayments support As part of the  agreement with the IMF the
    government agreed to institute a reform program to reduce inflation promote
    economic growth and improve its external position The reforms have been
    slow in coming however and the economy has been largely stagnant for the
    past four years The addition of  million people every seven months to
    Egypts population exerts enormous pressure on the  of the total land area
    available for agriculture

Estonia Economy

Overview
    Starting in July  under a new law on private ownership small
    enterprises such as retail shops and restaurants were sold to private
    owners The auctioning of largescale enterprises is now in progress with
    the proceeds being held in escrow until the prior ownership that is
    Estonian or the Commonwealth of Independent States can be established
    Estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the former Soviet
    republics Agriculture is well developed especially meat production and
    provides a surplus for export Only about onefifth of the work force is in
    agriculture The major share of the work force engages in manufacturing both
    capital and consumer goods based on raw materials and intermediate products
    from the other former Soviet republics These manufactures are of high
    quality by exSoviet standards and are exported to the other republics
    Estonias mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil 
    of old Soviet total and phosphorites  million tons Estonia has a
    large relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy
    needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants Like the other 
    successor republics Estonia is suffering through a difficult transitional
    period  between a collapsed command economic structure and a
    stilltobebuilt market structure It has advantages in the transition not
    having suffered so long under the Soviet yoke and having better chances of
    developing profitable ties to the Nordic and West European countries
