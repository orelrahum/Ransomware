Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move
And with Asphaltick slime broad as the gate
Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach
They fastened and the mole immense wrought on
Over the foaming deep higharched a bridge
Of length prodigious joining to the wall
Immoveable of this now fenceless world
Forfeit to Death from hence a passage broad
Smooth easy inoffensive down to Hell
So if great things to small may be compared
Xerxes the liberty of Greece to yoke
From Susa his Memnonian palace high
Came to the sea and over Hellespont
Bridging his way Europe with Asia joined
And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves
Now had they brought the work by wonderous art
Pontifical a ridge of pendant rock
Over the vexed abyss following the track
Of Satan to the selfsame place where he
First lighted from his wing and landed safe
From out of Chaos to the outside bare
Of this round world  With pins of adamant
And chains they made all fast too fast they made
And durable  And now in little space
The confines met of empyrean Heaven
And of this World and on the left hand Hell
With long reach interposed three several ways
In sight to each of these three places led
And now their way to Earth they had descried
To Paradise first tending when behold
Satan in likeness of an Angel bright
Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering
His zenith while the sun in Aries rose
Disguised he came but those his children dear
Their parent soon discerned though in disguise
He after Eve seduced unminded slunk
Into the wood fast by and changing shape
To observe the sequel saw his guileful act
By Eve though all unweeting seconded
Upon her husband saw their shame that sought
Vain covertures but when he saw descend
The Son of God to judge them terrified
He fled not hoping to escape but shun
The present fearing guilty what his wrath
Might suddenly inflict that past returned
By night and listening where the hapless pair
Sat in their sad discourse and various plaint
Thence gathered his own doom which understood
Not instant but of future time with joy
And tidings fraught to Hell he now returned
And at the brink of Chaos near the foot
Of this new wonderous pontifice unhoped
Met who to meet him came his offspring dear
Great joy was at their meeting and at sight
Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased
Long he admiring stood till Sin his fair
Enchanting daughter thus the silence broke
O Parent these are thy magnifick deeds
Thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own
Thou art their author and prime architect
For I no sooner in my heart divined
My heart which by a secret harmony
Still moves with thine joined in connexion sweet
That thou on earth hadst prospered which thy looks
Now also evidence but straight I felt
Though distant from thee worlds between yet felt
That I must after thee with this thy son
Such fatal consequence unites us three
Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds
Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure
Detain from following thy illustrious track
Thou hast achieved our liberty confined
Within Hellgates till now thou us impowered
To fortify thus far and overlay
With this portentous bridge the dark abyss
Thine now is all this world thy virtue hath won
What thy hands builded not thy wisdom gained
With odds what war hath lost and fully avenged
Our foil in Heaven here thou shalt monarch reign
There didst not there let him still victor sway
As battle hath adjudged from this new world
Retiring by his own doom alienated
And henceforth monarchy with thee divide
Of all things parted by the empyreal bounds
His quadrature from thy orbicular world
Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne
Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad
Fair Daughter and thou Son and Grandchild both
High proof ye now have given to be the race
Of Satan for I glory in the name
Antagonist of Heavens Almighty King
Amply have merited of me of all
The infernal empire that so near Heavens door
Triumphal with triumphal act have met
Mine with this glorious work and made one realm
Hell and this world one realm one continent
Of easy thoroughfare  Therefore while I
Descend through darkness on your road with ease
To my associate Powers them to acquaint
With these successes and with them rejoice
You two this way among these numerous orbs
All yours right down to Paradise descend
There dwell and reign in bliss thence on the earth
Dominion exercise and in the air
Chiefly on Man sole lord of all declared
Him first make sure your thrall and lastly kill
My substitutes I send ye and create
Plenipotent on earth of matchless might
Issuing from me on your joint vigour now
My hold of this new kingdom all depends
Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit
If your joint power prevail the affairs of Hell
No detriment need fear go and be strong
So saying he dismissed them they with speed
Their course through thickest constellations held
Spreading their bane the blasted stars looked wan
And planets planetstruck real eclipse
Then suffered  The other way Satan went down
The causey to Hellgate  On either side
Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed
And with rebounding surge the bars assailed
That scorned his indignation  Through the gate
Wide open and unguarded Satan passed
And all about found desolate for those
Appointed to sit there had left their charge
Flown to the upper world the rest were all
Far to the inland retired about the walls
Of Pandemonium city and proud seat
Of Lucifer so by allusion called
Of that bright star to Satan paragoned
There kept their watch the legions while the Grand
In council sat solicitous what chance
Might intercept their emperour sent so he
Departing gave command and they observed
As when the Tartar from his Russian foe
By Astracan over the snowy plains
Retires or Bactrin Sophi from the horns
Of Turkish crescent leaves all waste beyond
The realm of Aladule in his retreat
To Tauris or Casbeen  So these the late
Heavenbanished host left desart utmost Hell
Many a dark league reduced in careful watch
Round their metropolis and now expecting
Each hour their great adventurer from the search
Of foreign worlds  He through the midst unmarked
In show plebeian Angel militant
Of lowest order passed and from the door
Of that Plutonian hall invisible
Ascended his high throne which under state
Of richest texture spread at the upper end
Was placed in regal lustre  Down a while
He sat and round about him saw unseen
At last as from a cloud his fulgent head
And shape starbright appeared or brighter clad
With what permissive glory since his fall
Was left him or false glitter  All amazed
At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng
Bent their aspect and whom they wished beheld
Their mighty Chief returned loud was the acclaim
Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers
Raised from their dark Divan and with like joy
Congratulant approached him who with hand
Silence and with these words attention won
Thrones Dominations Princedoms Virtues Powers
For in possession such not only of right
I call ye and declare ye now returned
Successful beyond hope to lead ye forth
Triumphant out of this infernal pit
Abominable accursed the house of woe
And dungeon of our tyrant  Now possess
As Lords a spacious world to our native Heaven
Little inferiour by my adventure hard
With peril great achieved  Long were to tell
What I have done what sufferedwith what pain
Voyaged th unreal vast unbounded deep
Of horrible confusion over which
By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved
To expedite your glorious march but I
Toiled out my uncouth passage forced to ride
The untractable abyss plunged in the womb
Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild
That jealous of their secrets fiercely opposed
My journey strange with clamorous uproar
Protesting Fate supreme thence how I found
The new created world which fame in Heaven
Long had foretold a fabrick wonderful
Of absolute perfection therein Man
Placed in a Paradise by our exile
Made happy  Him by fraud I have seduced
From his Creator and the more to encrease
Your wonder with an apple he thereat
Offended worth your laughter hath given up
Both his beloved Man and all his world
To Sin and Death a prey and so to us
Without our hazard labour or alarm
To range in and to dwell and over Man
To rule as over all he should have ruled
True is me also he hath judged or rather
Me not but the brute serpent in whose shape
Man I deceived that which to me belongs
Is enmity which he will put between
Me and mankind I am to bruise his heel
His seed when is not set shall bruise my head
A world who would not purchase with a bruise
Or much more grievous pain?Ye have the account
Of my performance  What remains ye Gods
But up and enter now into full bliss?
So having said a while he stood expecting
Their universal shout and high applause
To fill his ear when contrary he hears
On all sides from innumerable tongues
A dismal universal hiss the sound
Of publick scorn he wondered but not long
Had leisure wondering at himself now more
His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare
His arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining
Each other till supplanted down he fell
A monstrous serpent on his belly prone
Reluctant but in vain a greater power
Now ruled him punished in the shape he sinned
According to his doom he would have spoke
But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
To forked tongue for now were all transformed
Alike to serpents all as accessories
To his bold riot  Dreadful was the din
Of hissing through the hall thick swarming now
With complicated monsters head and tail
Scorpion and Asp and Amphisbaena dire
Cerastes horned Hydrus and Elops drear
And Dipsas not so thick swarmed once the soil
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon or the isle
Ophiusa but still greatest he the midst
Now Dragon grown larger than whom the sun
Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime
Huge Python and his power no less he seemed
Above the rest still to retain they all
Him followed issuing forth to the open field
Where all yet left of that revolted rout
Heavenfallen in station stood or just array
Sublime with expectation when to see
In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief
They saw but other sight instead a croud
Of ugly serpents horrour on them fell
And horrid sympathy for what they saw
They felt themselves now changing down their arms
Down fell both spear and shield down they as fast
And the dire hiss renewed and the dire form
Catched by contagion like in punishment
As in their crime  Thus was the applause they meant
Turned to exploding hiss triumph to shame
Cast on themselves from their own mouths  There stood
A grove hard by sprung up with this their change
His will who reigns above to aggravate
Their penance laden with fair fruit like that
Which grew in Paradise the bait of Eve
Used by the Tempter on that prospect strange
Their earnest eyes they fixed imagining
For one forbidden tree a multitude
Now risen to work them further woe or shame
Yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce
Though to delude them sent could not abstain
But on they rolled in heaps and up the trees
Climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks
That curled Megaera greedily they plucked
The fruitage fair to sight like that which grew
Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed
This more delusive not the touch but taste
Deceived they fondly thinking to allay
Their appetite with gust instead of fruit
Chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste
With spattering noise rejected oft they assayed
Hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft
With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws
With soot and cinders filled so oft they fell
Into the same illusion not as Man
Whom they triumphed once lapsed  Thus were they plagued
And worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss
Till their lost shape permitted they resumed
Yearly enjoined some say to undergo
This annual humbling certain numbered days
To dash their pride and joy for Man seduced
However some tradition they dispersed
Among the Heathen of their purchase got
And fabled how the Serpent whom they called
Ophion with Eurynome the wide
Encroaching Eve perhaps had first the rule
Of high Olympus thence by Saturn driven
And Ops ere yet Dictaean Jove was born
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
Too soon arrived Sin there in power before
Once actual now in body and to dwell
Habitual habitant behind her Death
Close following pace for pace not mounted yet
On his pale horse to whom Sin thus began
Second of Satan sprung allconquering Death
What thinkest thou of our empire now though earned
With travel difficult not better far
Than still at Hells dark threshold to have sat watch
Unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved?
Whom thus the Sinborn monster answered soon
To me who with eternal famine pine
Alike is Hell or Paradise or Heaven
There best where most with ravine I may meet
Which here though plenteous all too little seems
To stuff this maw this vast unhidebound corps
To whom the incestuous mother thus replied
Thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flowers
Feed first on each beast next and fish and fowl
No homely morsels and whatever thing
The sithe of Time mows down devour unspared
Till I in Man residing through the race
His thoughts his looks words actions all infect
And season him thy last and sweetest prey
This said they both betook them several ways
Both to destroy or unimmortal make
All kinds and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later which the Almighty seeing
From his transcendent seat the Saints among
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice
See with what heat these dogs of Hell advance
To waste and havock yonder world which I
So fair and good created and had still
Kept in that state had not the folly of Man
Let in these wasteful furies whL RNKFGV
