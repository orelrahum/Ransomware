her here  And the executioner went off like an arrow

   The Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and
by the time he had come back with the Dutchess it had entirely
disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and
down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game



                           CHAPTER IX

                     The Mock Turtles Story


  You cant think how glad I am to see you again you dear old
thing said the Duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately
into Alices and they walked off together

  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen

  When IM a Duchess she said to herself not in a very
hopeful tone though I wont have any pepper in my kitchen AT
ALL  Soup does very well withoutMaybe its always pepper that
makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at
having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them
sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar
and such things that make children sweettempered  I only wish
people knew that  then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you
know

  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time and was a
little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear
Youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you
forget to talk  I cant tell you just now what the moral of that
is but I shall remember it in a bit

  Perhaps it hasnt one Alice ventured to remark

  Tut tut child said the Duchess  Everythings got a
moral if only you can find it  And she squeezed herself up
closer to Alices side as she spoke

  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her  first
because the Duchess was VERY ugly and secondly because she was
exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alices shoulder
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin  However she did not
like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could

  The games going on rather better now she said by way of
keeping up the conversation a little

  Tis so said the Duchess  and the moral of that is"Oh
tis love tis love that makes the world go round"

  Somebody said Alice whispered that its done by everybody
minding their own business

  Ah well  It means much the same thing said the Duchess
digging her sharp little chin into Alices shoulder as she added
and the moral of THAT is"Take care of the sense and the
sounds will take care of themselves"

  How fond she is of finding morals in things Alice thought to
herself

  I dare say youre wondering why I dont put my arm round your
waist tSV WFXSVHH HZRW ZUGVI Z KZFHV  GSV IVZHLM RH GSZG RN
