     the scanner itself to recognize this situation and deal with it
     appropriatelya kind of autosegmentation that would enable the
     scanner to handle halftone material as well as text on a single page

      The books subjected to the elaborate process described above were
     selected because CLASS is a preservation project with the first 
     books selected coming from Cornells mathematics collection because
     they were still being heavily used and because although they were
     in need of preservation the mathematics library and the mathematics
     faculty were uncomfortable having them microfilmed  They wanted a
     printed copy  Thus these books became a logical choice for this
     project  Other books were chosen by the projects selection committees
     for experiments with the technology as well as to meet a demand or need

      Images will be decompressed before they are sent over the line at
     this time they are compressed and sent to the image filing system
     and then sent to the printer as compressed images they are returned
     to the workstation as compressed dpi images and the workstation
     decompresses and scales them for displayan inefficient way to
     access the material though it works quite well for printing and
     other purposes

      CLASS is also decompressing on Macintosh and IBM a slow process
     right now  Eventually compression and decompression will take
     place on an image conversion server  Tradeoffs will be made based
     on future performance testing concerning where the file is
     compressed and what resolution image is sent

      OCR has not been precluded images are being stored that have been
     scanned at a high resolution which presumably would suit them well
     to an OCR process  Because the material being scanned is about 
     years old and was printed with lessthanideal technologies very
     early and preliminary tests have not produced good results  But the
     project is capturing an image that is of sufficient resolution to be
     subjected to OCR in the future  Moreover the system architecture
     and the system plan have a logical place to store an OCR image if it
     has been captured  But that is not being done now

                                 

SESSION III  DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS AND NETWORKING  OPTIONS FOR
DISSEMINATION


ZICH  Issues pertaining to CDROMs  Options for publishing in CDROM 


Robert ZICH special assistant to the associate librarian for special
projects Library of Congress and moderator of this session first noted
the blessed but somewhat awkward circumstance of having four very
distinguished people representing networks and networking or at least
leaning in that direction while lacking anyone to speak from the
strongest possible background in CDROMs  ZICH expressed the hope that
members of the audience would join the discussion  He stressed the
subtitle of this particular session "Options for Dissemination" and
concerning CDROMs the importance of determining when it would be wise
to consider dissemination in CDROM versus networks  A shopping list of
issues pertaining to CDROMs included  the grounds for selecting
commercial publishers and inhouse publication where possible versus
nonprofit or government publication  A similar list for networks
included  determining when one should consider dissemination through a
network identifying the mechanisms or entities that exist to place items
on networks identifying the pool of existing networks determining how a
producer  would choose between networks and identifying the elements of
a business arrangement in a network

Options for publishing in CDROM  an outside publisher versus
selfpublication  If an outside publisher is used it can be nonprofit
such as the Government Printing Office GPO or the National Technical
Information Service NTIS in the case of government  The pros and cons
associated with employing an outside publisher are obvious  Among the
pros there is no trouble getting accepted  One pays the bill and in
effect goes ones way  Among the cons when one pays an outside
publisher to perform the work that publisher will perform the work it is
obliged to do but perhaps without the production expertise and skill in
marketing and dissemination that some would seek  There is the body of
commercial publishers that do possess that kind of expertise in
distribution and marketing but that obviously are selective  In
selfpublication one exercises full control but then one must handle
matters such as distribution and marketing  Such are some of the options
for publishing in the case of CDROM

In the case of technical and design issues which are also important
there are many matters which many at the Workshop already knew a good
deal about  retrieval system requirements and costs what to do about
images the various capabilities and platforms the tradeoffs between
cost and performance concerns about localarea networkability
interoperability etc

Clifford LYNCH director Library Automation University of California
opened his talk with the general observation that networked information
constituted a difficult and elusive topic because it is something just
starting to develop and not yet fully understood  LYNCH contended that
creating genuinely networked information was different from using
networks as an access or dissemination vehicle and was more sophisticated
and more subtle  He invited the members of the audience to extrapolate
from what they heard about the preceding demonstration projects to what
sort of a world of electronics informationscholarly archival
cultural etcthey wished to end up with ten or fifteen years from now
LYNCH suggested that to extrapolate directly from these projects would
produce unpleasant results

Putting the issue of CDROM in perspective before getting into
generalities on networked information LYNCH observed that those engaged
in multimedia today who wish to ship a product so to say probably do
not have much choice except to use CDROM  networked multimedia on a
large scale basically does not yet work because the technology does not
exist  For example anybody who has tried moving images around over the
Internet knows that this is an exciting touchandgo process a
fascinating and fertile area for experimentation research and
development but not something that one can become deeply enthusiastic
about committing to production systems at this time

This situation will change LYNCH said  He differentiated CDROM from
the practices that have been followed up to now in distributing data on
CDROM  For LYNCH the problem with CDROM is not its portability or its
slowness but the twoedged sword of having the retrieval application and
the user interface inextricably bound up with the data which is the
typical CDROM publication model  It is not a case of publishing data
but of distributing a typically standalone typically closed system
allsoftware user interface and dataon a little disk  Hence all
the betweendisk navigational issues as well as the impossibility in most
cases of integrating data on one disk with that on another  Most CDROM
retrieval software does not network very gracefully at present  However
in the present world of immature standards and lack of understanding of
what network information is or what the ground rules are for creating or
using it publishing information on a CDROM does add value in a very
real sense

LYNCH drew a contrast between CDROM and network pricing and in doing so
highlighted something bizarre in information pricing  A large
institution such as the University of California has vendors who will
offer to sell information on CDROM for a price per year in four digits
but for the same data eg an abstracting and indexing database on
magnetic tape regardless of how many people may use it concurrently
will quote a price in six digits

What is packaged with the CDROM in one sense adds valuea complete
access system not just raw unrefined informationalthough it is not
generally perceived that way  This is because the access software
although it adds value is viewed by some people particularly in the
university environment where there is a very heavy commitment to
networking as being developed in the wrong direction

Given that context LYNCH described the examples demonstrated as a set of
insular information gemsPerseus for example offers nicely linked
information but would be very difficult to integrate with other
databases that is to link together seamlessly with other source files
from other sources  It resembles an island and in this respect is
similar to numerous standalone projects that are based on videodiscs
that is on the singleworkstation concept

As scholarship evolves in a network environment the paramount need will
be to link databases  We must link personal databases to public
databases to group databases in fairly seamless wayswhich is
extremely difficult in the environments under discussion with copies of
databases proliferating all over the place

The notion of layering also struck LYNCH as lurking in several of the
projects demonstrated  Several databases in a sense constitute
information archives without a significant amount of navigation built in
Educators critics and others will want a layered structureone that
defines or links paths through the layers to allow users to reach
specific points  In LYNCHs view layering will become increasingly
necessary and not just within a single resource but across resources
eg tracing mythology and cultural themes across several classics
databases as well as a database of Renaissance culture  This ability to
organize resources to build things out of multiple other things on the
network or select pieces of it represented for LYNCH one of the key
aspects of network information

Contending that information reuse constituted another significant issue
LYNCH commended to the audiences attention Project NEEDS ie National
Engineering Education Delivery System  This projects objective is to
produce a database of engineering courseware as well as the components
that can be used to develop new courseware  In a number of the existing
applications LYNCH said the issue of reuse how much one can take apart
and reuse in other applications was not being well considered  He also
raised the issue of active versus passive use one aspect of which  is
how much information will be manipulated locally by users  Most people
he argued may do a little browsing and then will wish to print  LYNCH
was uncertain how these resources would be used by the vast majority of
users in the network environment

LYNCH next said a few words about XWindows as a way of differentiating
between network access and networked information  A number of the
applications demonstrated at the Workshop could be rewritten to use X
across the network so that one could run them from any Xcapable device
a workstation an X terminaland transact with a database across the
network  Although this opens up access a little assuming one has enough
network to handle it it does not provide an interface to develop a
program that conveniently integrates information from multiple databases
X is a viewing technology that has limits  In a real sense it is just a
graphical version of remote login across the network  Xtype applications
represent only one step in the progression towards real access

LYNCH next discussed barriers to the distribution of networked multimedia
information  The heart of the problem is a lack of standards to provide
the ability for computers to talk to each other retrieve information
and shuffle it around fairly casually  At the moment little progress is
being made on standards for networked information for example present
standards do not cover images digital voice and digital video  A
useful tool kit of exchange formats for basic texts is only now being
assembled  The synchronization of content streams ie synchronizing a
voice track to a video track establishing temporal relations between
different components in a multimedia object constitutes another issue
for networked multimedia that is just beginning to receive attention

Underlying network protocols also need some work good realtime
delivery protocols on the Internet do not yet exist  In LYNCHs view
highly important in this context is the notion of networked digital
object IDs the ability of one object on the network to point to another
object or component thereof on the network  Serious bandwidth issues
also exist  LYNCH was uncertain if billionbitpersecond networks would
prove sufficient if numerous people ran video in parallel

LYNCH concluded by offering an issue for database creators to consider
as well as several comments about what might constitute good trial
multimedia experiments  In a networked information world the database
builder or service builder publisher does not exercise the same
extensive control over the integrity of the presentation strange
programs "munge" with ones data before the user sees it  Serious
thought must be given to what guarantees integrity of presentation  Part
of that is related to where one draws the boundaries around a networked
information service  This question of presentation integrity in
clientserver computing has not been stressed enough in the academic
world LYNCH argued though commercial service providers deal with it
regularly

Concerning multimedia LYNCH observed that good multimedia at the moment
is hideously expensive to produce  He recommended producing multimedia
with either very high sale value LI NFOGRNVWRZ DRGS Z EVIB OLMT ORUV
