Pakistan Economy

Overview
    Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the usual problems of
    rapidly increasing population sizable government deficits and heavy
    dependence on foreign aid In addition the economy must support a large
    military establishment and provide for the needs of  million Afghan
    refugees A real economic growth rate averaging  in recent years has
    enabled the country to cope with these problems Almost all agriculture and
    smallscale industry is in private hands In  Pakistan embarked on a
    sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and domestic
    private investment and lower foreign aid dependence The SHARIF government
    has denationalized several stateowned firms and has attracted some foreign
    investment Pakistan likely will have difficulty raising living standards
    because of its rapidly expanding population At the current rate of growth
    population would double in  years
