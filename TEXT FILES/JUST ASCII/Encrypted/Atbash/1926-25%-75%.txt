MICHELSONs  TWOHIG emphasized literary scholars complete ignorance of
the technological options available to them or their reluctance or in
some cases their downright hostility toward these options

After providing an overview of the five Founding Fathers projects
Jefferson at Princeton Franklin at Yale John Adams at the
Massachusetts Historical Society and Madison down the hall from her at
the University of Virginia TWOHIG observed that the Washington papers
like all of the projects include both sides of the Washington
correspondence and deal with some  documents to be published with
extensive annotation in eighty to eightyfive volumes a project that
will not be completed until well into the next century  Thus it was
with considerable enthusiasm several years ago that the Washington Papers
Project WPP greeted David Packards suggestion that the papers of the
Founding Fathers could be published easily and inexpensively and to the
great benefit of American scholarship via CDROM

In pragmatic terms funding from the Packard Foundation would expedite
the transcription of thousands of documents waiting to be put on disk in
the WPP offices  Further since the costs of collecting editing and
converting the Founding Fathers documents into letterpress editions were
running into the millions of dollars and the considerable staffs
involved in all of these projects were devoting their careers to
producing the work the Packard Foundations suggestion had a
revolutionary aspect  Transcriptions of the entire corpus of the
Founding Fathers papers would be available on CDROM to public and
college libraries even high schools at a fraction of the cost
 for the annual license feeto produce a limited university
press run of  of each volume of the published papers at  per
printed volume  Given the current budget crunch in educational systems
