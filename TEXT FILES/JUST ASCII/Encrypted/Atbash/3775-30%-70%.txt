Behind him cast The broad circumference
Hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb
Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views
At evening from the top of Fesole
Or in Valdarno to descry new lands
Rivers or mountains in her spotty globe
His spearto equal which the tallest pine
Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast
Of some great ammiral were but a wand
He walked with to support uneasy steps
Over the burning marl not like those steps
On Heavens azure and the torrid clime
Smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire
Nathless he so endured till on the beach
Of that inflamed sea he stood and called
His legionsAngel Forms who lay entranced
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
In Vallombrosa where th Etrurian shades
High overarched embower or scattered sedge
Afloat when with fierce winds Orion armed
Hath vexed the RedSea coast whose waves oerthrew
Busiris and his Memphian chivalry
While with perfidious hatred they pursued
The sojourners of Goshen who beheld
From the safe shore their floating carcases
And broken chariotwheels So thick bestrown
Abject and lost lay these covering the flood
Under amazement of their hideous change
He called so loud that all the hollow deep
Of Hell resounded"Princes Potentates
Warriors the Flower of Heavenonce yours now lost
If such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal Spirits Or have ye chosen this place
After the toil of battle to repose
Your wearied virtue for the ease you find
To slumber here as in the vales of Heaven?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conqueror who now beholds
Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood
With scattered arms and ensigns till anon
His swift pursuers from Heavengates discern
Th advantage and descending tread us down
Thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts
Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?
Awake arise or be for ever fallen"
  They heard and were abashed and up they sprung
Upon the wing as when men wont to watch
On duty sleeping found by whom they dread
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight
In which they were or the fierce pains not feel
Yet to their Generals voice they soon obeyed
Innumerable As when the potent rod
Of Amrams son in Egypts evil day
Waved round the coast upcalled a pitchy cloud
Of locusts warping on the eastern wind
That oer the realm of impious Pharaoh hung
Like Night and darkened all the land of Nile
So numberless were those bad Angels seen
Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell
Twixt upper nether and surrounding fires
Till as a signal given th uplifted spear
Of their great Sultan waving to direct
Their course in even balance down they light
On the firm brimstone and fill all the plain
A multitude like which the populous North
Poured never from her frozen loins to pass
Rhene or the Danaw when her barbarous sons
Came like a deluge on the South and spread
Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands
Forthwith form every squadron and each band
The heads and leaders thither haste where stood
Their great Commandergodlike Shapes and Forms
Excelling human princely Dignities
And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones
Though on their names in Heavenly records now
Be no memorial blotted out and rased
By their rebellion from the Books of Life
Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve
Got them new names till wandering oer the earth
Through Gods high sufferance for the trial of man
By falsities and lies the greatest part
Of mankind they corrupted to forsake
God their Creator and th invisible
Glory of him that made them to transform
Oft to the image of a brute adorned
With gay religions full of pomp and gold
And devils to adore for deities
Then were they known to men by various names
And various idols through the heathen world
  Say Muse their names then known who first who last
Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch
At their great Emperors call as next in worth
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand
While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?
  The chief were those who from the pit of Hell
Roaming to seek their prey on Earth durst fix
Their seats long after next the seat of God
Their altars by his altar gods adored
Among the nations round and durst abide
Jehovah thundering out of Sion throned
Between the Cherubim yea often placed
Within his sanctuary itself their shrines
Abominations and with cursed things
His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned
And with their darkness durst affront his light
First Moloch horrid king besmeared with blood
Of human sacrifice and parents tears
Though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud
Their childrens cries unheard that passed through fire
To his grim idol Him the Ammonite
Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain
In Argob and in Basan to the stream
Of utmost Arnon Nor content with such
Audacious neighbourhood the wisest heart
Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build
His temple right against the temple of God
On that opprobrious hill and made his grove
The pleasant valley of Hinnom Tophet thence
And black Gehenna called the type of Hell
Next Chemos th obscene dread of Moabs sons
From Aroar to Nebo and the wild
Of southmost Abarim in Hesebon
And Horonaim Seons real beyond
The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines
And Eleale to th Asphaltic Pool
Peor his other name when he enticed
Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile
To do him wanton rites which cost them woe
Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged
Even to that hill of scandal by the grove
Of Moloch homicide lust hard by hate
Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell
With these came they who from the bordering flood
Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts
Egypt from Syrian ground had general names
Of Baalim and Ashtaroththose male
These feminine For Spirits when they please
Can either sex assume or both so soft
And uncompounded is their essence pure
Not tried or manacled with joint or limb
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones
Like cumbrous flesh but in what shape they choose
Dilated or condensed bright or obscure
Can execute their airy purposes
And works of love or enmity fulfil
For those the race of Israel oft forsook
Their Living Strength and unfrequented left
His righteous altar bowing lowly down
To bestial gods for which their heads as low
Bowed down in battle sunk before the spear
Of despicable foes With these in troop
Came Astoreth whom the Phoenicians called
Astarte queen of heaven with crescent horns
To whose bright image nigntly by the moon
Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs
In Sion also not unsung where stood
Her temple on th offensive mountain built
By that uxorious king whose heart though large
Beguiled by fair idolatresses fell
To idols foul Thammuz came next behind
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate
In amorous ditties all a summers day
While smooth Adonis from his native rock
Ran purple to the sea supposed with blood
Of Thammuz yearly wounded the lovetale
Infected Sions daughters with like heat
Whose wanton passions in the sacred proch
Ezekiel saw when by the vision led
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries
Of alienated Judah Next came one
Who mourned in earnest when the captive ark
Maimed his brute image head and hands lopt off
In his own temple on the grunseledge
Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers
Dagon his name seamonsterupward man
And downward fish yet had his temple high
Reared in Azotus dreaded through the coast
Of Palestine in Gath and Ascalon
And Accaron and Gazas frontier bounds
Him followed Rimmon whose delightful seat
Was fair Damascus on the fertile banks
Of Abbana and Pharphar lucid streams
He also against the house of God was bold
A leper once he lost and gained a king
Ahaz his sottish conqueror whom he drew
Gods altar to disparage and displace
For one of Syrian mode whereon to burn
His odious offerings and adore the gods
Whom he had vanquished After these appeared
A crew who under names of old renown
Osiris Isis Orus and their train
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
Rather than human Nor did Israel scape
Th infection when their borrowed gold composed
The calf in Oreb and the rebel king
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox
Jehovah who in one night when he passed
From Egypt marching equalled with one stroke
Both her firstborn and all her bleating gods
Belial came last than whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven or more gross to love
Vice for itself To him no temple stood
Or altar smoked yet who more oft than he
In temples and at altars when the priest
Turns atheist as did Elis sons who filled
With lust and violence the house of God?
In courts and palaces he also reigns
And in luxurious cities where the noise
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers
And injury and outrage and when night
Darkens the streets then wander forth the sons
Of Belial flown with insolence and wine
Witness the streets of Sodom and that night
In Gibeah when the hospitable door
Exposed a matron to avoid worse rape
  These were the prime in order and in might
The rest were long to tell though far renowned
Th Ionian godsof Javans issue held
Gods yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth
Their boasted parentsTitan Heavens firstborn
With his enormous brood and birthright seized
By younger Saturn he from mightier Jove
His own and Rheas son like measure found
So Jove usurping reigned These first in Crete
And Ida known thence on the snowy top
Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air
Their highest heaven or on the Delphian cliff
Or in Dodona and through all the bounds
Of Doric land or who with Saturn old
Fled over Adria to th Hesperian fields
And oer the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles
  All these and more came flocking but with looks
Downcast and damp yet such wherein appeared
Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief
Not in despair to have found themselves not lost
In loss itself which on his countenance cast
Like doubtful hue But he his wonted pride
Soon recollecting with high words that bore
Semblance of worth not substance gently raised
Their fainting courage and dispelled their fears
Then straight commands that at the warlike sound
Of trumpets loud and clarions be upreared
His mighty standard That proud honour claimed
Azazel as his right a Cherub tall
Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled
Th imperial ensign which full high advanced
Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind
With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed
Seraphic arms and trophies all the while
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds
At which the universal host upsent
A shout that tore Hells concave and beyond
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night
All in a moment through the gloom were seen
Ten thousand banners rise into the air
With orient colours waving with them rose
A forest huge of spears and thronging helms
Appeared and serried shields in thick array
Of depth immeasurable Anon they move
In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood
Of flutes and soft recorderssuch as raised
To height of noblest temper heroes old
Arming to battle and instead of rage
Deliberate valour breathed firm and unmoved
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage
With solemn touches troubled thoughts and chase
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
From mortal or immortal minds Thus they
Breathing united force with fixed thought
Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed
Their painful steps oer the burnt soil And now
Advanced in view they standa horrid front
Of dreadful length and dazzling arms in guise
Of warriors old with ordered spear and shield
Awaiting what command their mighty Chief
Had to impose He through the armed files
Darts his experienced eye and soon traverse
The whole battalion viewstheir order due
Their visages and stature as of gods
Their number last he sums And now his heart
Distends with pride and hardening in his strength
Glories for never since created Man
Met such embodied force as named with these
Could merit more than that small infantry
Warred on by cranesthough all the giant brood
Of Phlegra with th heroic race were joined
That fought at Thebes and Ilium on each side
Mixed with auxiliar gods and what resounds
In fable or romance of Uthers son
Begirt with British and Armoric knights
And all who since baptized or infidel
Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban
Damasco or Marocco or Trebisond
Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore
When Charlemain with all his peerage fell
By Fontarabbia Thus far these beyond
Compare of mortal prowess yet observed
Their dread Commander He above the rest
In shape and gesture proudly eminent
Stood like a tower His form had yet not lost
All her original brightness nor appeared
Less than Archangel ruined and th excess
Of glory obscured as when the sun newrisen
Looks through the horizontal misty air
Shorn of his beams or from behind the moon
In dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds
On half the nations and with fear of change
Perplexes monarchs Darkened so yet shone
Above them all th Archangel but his face
Deep scars of thunder had intrenched and care
Sat on his faded cheek but under brows
Of dauntless courage and considerate pride
Waiting revenge Cruel his eye but cast
Signs of remorse and passion to behold
The fellows of his crime the followers rather
Far other once beheld in bliss condemned
For ever now to have their lot in pain
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced
Of Heaven and from eteranl splendours flung
For his revoltyet faithful how they stood
Their glory withered as when heavens fire
Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines
With singed top their stately growth though bare
Stands on the blasted heath He now prepared
To speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend
From wing to wing and half enclose him round
With all his peers attention held them mute
Thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn
Tears such as Angels weep burst forth at last
Words interwove with sighs found out their way
  "O myriads of immortal Spirits O Powers
Matchless but with th Almighthand that strife
Was not inglorious though th event was dire
As this place testifies and this dire change
Hateful to utter But what power of mind
Forseeing or presaging from the depth
Of knowledge past or present could have feared
How such united force of gods how such
As stood like these could ever know repulse?
For who can yet believe though after loss
That all these puissant legions whose exile
Hath emptied Heaven shall fail to reascend
Selfraised and repossess their native seat?
For me be witness all the host of Heaven
If counsels different or danger shunned
By me have lost our hopes But he who reigns
Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure
Sat on his throne upheld by old repute
Consent or custom and his regal state
Put forth at full but still his strength concealed
Which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall
Henceforth his might we know and know our own
So as not either to provoke or dread
New war provoked oFI YVGGVI KZIG IVNZRMH
