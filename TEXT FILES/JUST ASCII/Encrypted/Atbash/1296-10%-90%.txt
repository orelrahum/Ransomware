Gabon Economy

Overview
    The economy dependent on timber and manganese until the early s is now
    dominated by the oil sector During the period  oil accounted for
    about  of GDP  of export earnings and  of government revenues on
    average The high oil prices of the early s contributed to a substantial
    increase in per capita income stimulated domestic demand reinforced
    migration from rural to urban areas and raised the level of real wages to
    among the highest in SubSaharan Africa The threeyear slide of Gabons
    economy which began with falling oil prices in  was reversed in 
    because of a near doubling of oil prices over their  lows In  the
    economy posted strong growth despite serious strikes but debt servicing
