United Kingdom Economy

Overview
    The UK is one of the worlds great trading powers and financial centers and
    its economy ranks among the four largest in Europe The economy is
    essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture of social welfare
    programs and government ownership Prime Minister MAJOR has continued the
    basic thrust of THATCHERs efforts to halt the expansion of welfare measures
    and promote extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector
    Agriculture is intensive highly mechanized and efficient by European
    standards producing about  of food needs with only  of the labor
    force Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises employing
    about  of the work force and generating  of GDP The UK is an
    energyrich nation with large coal natural gas and oil reserves primary
    energy production accounts for  of GDP one of the highest shares of any
    industrial nation In mid the economy fell into recession after eight
    years of strong economic expansion which had raised national output by one
    quarter Britains inflation rate which has been consistently well above
    those of her major trading partners declined significantly in  Between
     and  unemployment fell from  to about  but crept back up to
     in  because of the economic slowdown As a major trading nation the
    UK will continue to be greatly affected by world boom or recession swings
    in the international oil market productivity trends in domestic industry
    and the terms on which the economic integration of Europe proceeds

United States Economy

Overview
    The US has the most powerful diverse and technologically advanced economy
    in the world with a per capita GDP of  the largest among major
    industrial nations The economy is market oriented with most decisions made
    by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of
    goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace In  the
    economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth the
    longest in peacetime history The expansion featured moderation in wage and
    consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to  of
    the labor force In  however growth slowed to  because of a
    combination of factors such as the worldwide increase in interest rates
    Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in August the subsequent spurt in oil prices and
    a general decline in business and consumer confidence In  output failed
    to recover unemployment grew and signs of recovery proved premature
    Ongoing problems for the s include inadequate investment in economic
    infrastructure rapidly rising medical costs and sizable budget and trade
    deficits
