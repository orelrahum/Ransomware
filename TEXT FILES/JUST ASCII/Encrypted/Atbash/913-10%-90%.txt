    Sea Bering Strait Coral Sea East China Sea Gulf of Alaska Makassar
    Strait Philippine Sea Ross Sea Sea of Japan Sea of Okhotsk South China
    Sea Tasman Sea and other tributary water bodies
Comparative area
    slightly less than  times the size of the US the largest ocean followed
    by the Atlantic Ocean the Indian Ocean and the Arctic Ocean covers about
    onethird of the global surface larger than the total land area of the
    world
Coastline
     km
Disputes
    some maritime disputes see littoral states
Climate
    the western Pacific is monsoonal  a rainy season occurs during the summer
    months when moistureladen winds blow from the ocean over the land and a
    dry season during the winter months when dry winds blow from the Asian land
    mass back to the ocean
Terrain
    surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise warmwater gyre
    broad circular system of currents and in the southern Pacific by a
    counterclockwise coolwater gyre sea ice occurs in the Bering Sea and Sea
    of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from Antarctica
    in October the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East
    Pacific Rise while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches the
    worlds greatest depth is  meters in the Marianas Trench
Natural resources
    oil and gas fields polymetallic nodules sand and gravel aggregates placer
    deposits fish
Environment
    endangered marine species include the dugong sea lion sea otter seals
    turtles and whales oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea
    dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the
    southwestern Pacific Ocean subject to tropical cyclones typhoons in
    southeast and east Asia from May to December most frequent from July to
    October tropical cyclones hurricanes may form south of Mexico and strike
    Central America and Mexico from June to October most common in August and
    September southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica
    occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade
    winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south killing
    the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies consequently
    the anchovies move to better feeding grounds causing resident marine birds
    to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source
Note
    the major choke points are the Bering Strait Panama Canal Luzon Strait
    and the Singapore Strait the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the
    North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean ships subject to
    superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme
    south from May to October persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June
    to December is a hazard to shipping surrounded by a zone of violent
    volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring
    of Fire

Pacific Ocean Economy

Overview
    The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
    particularly to those nations its waters directly touch It provides cheap
    sea transportation between East and West extensive fishing grounds
    offshore oil and gas fields minerals and sand and gravel for the
    construction industry In  over half  of the worlds total fish
    catch came from the Pacific Ocean which is the only ocean where the fish
    catch has increased every year since  Exploitation of offshore oil and
    gas reserves is playing an everincreasing role in the energy supplies of
    Australia New Zealand China US and Peru The high cost of recovering
    offshore oil and gas combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil
    since  has slowed but not stopped new drillings

Pakistan Economy

Overview
    Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the usual problems of
    rapidly increasing population sizable government deficits and heavy
    dependence on foreign aid In addition the economy must support a large
    military establishment and provide for the needs of  million Afghan
    refugees A real economic growth rate averaging  in recent years has
    enabled the country to cope with these problems Almost all agriculture and
    smallscale industry is in private hands In  Pakistan embarked on a
    sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and domestic
    private investment and lower foreign aid dependence The SHARIF government
    has denationalized several stateowned firms and has attracted some foreign
    investment Pakistan likely will have difficulty raising living standards
    because of its rapidly expanding population At the current rate of growth
    population would double in  years
