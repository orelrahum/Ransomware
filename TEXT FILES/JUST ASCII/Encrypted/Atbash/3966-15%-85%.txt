Macedonia Economy

Overview
    Macedonia although the poorest among the six republics of a disintegrated
    Yugoslav federation can meet basic food and energy needs through its own
    agricultural and coal resources As a breakaway republic however it will
    move down toward a bare subsistence level of life unless economic ties are
    reforged or enlarged with its neighbors Serbia Albania Greece and
    Bulgaria The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas
    and its modern machinery and parts Continued political turmoil both
    internally and in the region as a whole prevents any swift readjustments of
    trade patterns and economic rules of the game Inflation in early  was
    out of control the result of fracturing trade links the decline in
    economic activity and general uncertainties about the future status of the
    country prices rose  in March  alone Macedonias geographical
    isolation technological backwardness and political instability place it
    far down the list of countries of interest to Western investors Recognition
    of Macedonia by the EC and an internal commitment to economic reform would
    help to encourage foreign investment over the long run
