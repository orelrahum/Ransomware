ROSALIND	O ominous he comes to kill my heart

CELIA	I would sing my song without a burden thou bringest
	me out of tune

ROSALIND	Do you not know I am a woman? when I think I must
	speak Sweet say on

CELIA	You bring me out Soft comes he not here?

	Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES

ROSALIND	Tis he slink by and note him

JAQUES	I thank you for your company but good faith I had
	as lief have been myself alone

ORLANDO	And so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you
	too for your society

JAQUES	God be wi you lets meet as little as we can

ORLANDO	I do desire we may be better strangers

JAQUES	I pray you mar no more trees with writing
	lovesongs in their barks

ORLANDO	I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading
	them illfavouredly

JAQUES	Rosalind is your loves name?

ORLANDO	Yes just

JAQUES	I do not like her name

ORLANDO	There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
	christened

JAQUES	What stature is she of?

ORLANDO	Just as high as my heart

JAQUES	You are full of pretty answers Have you not been
	acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them
	out of rings?

ORLANDO	Not so but I answer you right painted cloth from
	whence you have studied your questions

JAQUES	You have a nimble wit I think twas made of
	Atalantas heels Will you sit down with me? and
	we two will rail against our mistress the world and
	all our misery

ORLANDO	I will chide no breather in the world but myself
	against whom I know most faults

JAQUES	The worst fault you have is to be in love

ORLANDO	Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue
	I am weary of you

JAQUES	By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found
	you

ORLANDO	He is drowned in the brook look but in and you
	shall see him

JAQUES	There I shall see mine own figure

ORLANDO	Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher

JAQUES	Ill tarry no longer with you farewell good
	Signior Love

ORLANDO	I am glad of your departure adieu good Monsieur
	Melancholy

	Exit JAQUES

ROSALIND	Aside to CELIA  I will speak to him like a saucy
	lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
	Do you hear forester?

ORLANDO	Very well what would you?

ROSALIND	I pray you what ist oclock?

ORLANDO	You should ask me what time o day theres no clock
	in the forest

ROSALIND	Then there is no true lover in the forest else
	sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
	detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock

ORLANDO	And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
	been as proper?

ROSALIND	By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with
	divers persons Ill tell you who Time ambles
	withal who Time trots withal who Time gallops
	withal and who he stands still withal

ORLANDO	I prithee who doth he trot withal?

ROSALIND	Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
	contract of her marriage and the day it is
	solemnized if the interim be but a sennight
	Times pace is so hard that it seems the length of
	seven year

ORLANDO	Who ambles Time withal?

ROSALIND	With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
	hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because
	he cannot study and the other lives merrily because
	he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean
	and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden
	of heavy tedious penury these Time ambles withal

ORLANDO	Who doth he gallop withal?

ROSALIND	With a thief to the gallows for though he go as
	softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there

ORLANDO	Who stays it still withal?

ROSALIND	With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between
	term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves

ORLANDO	Where dwell you pretty youth?

ROSALIND	With this shepherdess my sister here in the
	skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat

ORLANDO	Are you native of this place?

ROSALIND	As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled

ORLANDO	Your accent is something finer than you could
	purchase in so removed a dwelling

ROSALIND	I have been told so of many but indeed an old
	religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was
	in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship
	too well for there he fell in love I have heard
	him read many lectures against it and I thank God
	I am not a woman to be touched with so many
	giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
	whole sex withal

ORLANDO	Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
	laid to the charge of women?

ROSALIND	There were none principal they were all like one
	another as halfpence are every one fault seeming
	monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it

ORLANDO	I prithee recount some of them

ROSALIND	No I will not cast away my physic but on those that
	are sick There is a man haunts the forest that
	abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on
	their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
	on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of
	Rosalind if I could meet that fancymonger I would
	give him some good counsel for he seems to have the
	quotidian of love upon him

ORLANDO	I am he that is so loveshaked I pray you tell me
	your remedy

ROSALIND	There is none of my uncles marks upon you he
	taught me how to know a man in love in which cage
	of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner

ORLANDO	What were his marks?

ROSALIND	A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and
	sunken which you have not an unquestionable
	spirit which you have not a beard neglected
	which you have not but I pardon you for that for
	simply your having in beard is a younger brothers
	revenue then your hose should be ungartered your
	bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe
	untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
	careless desolation but you are no such man you
	are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as
	loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other

ORLANDO	Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love

ROSALIND	Me believe it you may as soon make her that you
	love believe it which I warrant she is apter to
	do than to confess she does that is one of the
	points in the which women still give the lie to
	their consciences But in good sooth are you he
	that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind
	is so admired?

ORLANDO	I swear to thee youth by the white hand of
	Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he

ROSALIND	But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?

ORLANDO	Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much

ROSALIND	Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves
	as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and
	the reason why they are not so punished and cured
	is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
	are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel

ORLANDO	Did you ever cure any so?

ROSALIND	Yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me
	his love his mistress and I set him every day to
	woo me at which time would I being but a moonish
	youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing
	and liking proud fantastical apish shallow
	inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
	passion something and for no passion truly any
	thing as boys and women are for the most part
	cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe
	him then entertain him then forswear him now weep
	for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor
	from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
	madness which was to forswear the full stream of
	the world and to live in a nook merely monastic
	And thus I cured him and this way will I take upon
	me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps
	heart that there shall not be one spot of love int

ORLANDO	I would not be cured youth

ROSALIND	I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind
	and come every day to my cote and woo me

ORLANDO	Now by the faith of my love I will tell me
	where it is

ROSALIND	Go with me to it and Ill show it you and by the way
	you shall tell me where in the forest you live
	Will you go?

ORLANDO	With all my heart good youth

ROSALIND	Nay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you go?

	Exeunt

SCENE III	The forest


	Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY JAQUES behind

TOUCHSTONE	Come apace good Audrey I will fetch up your
	goats Audrey And how Audrey? am I the man yet?
	doth my simple feature content you?

AUDREY	Your features Lord warrant us what features

TOUCHSTONE	I am here with thee and thy goats as the most
	capricious poet honest Ovid was among the Goths

JAQUES	Aside  O knowledge illinhabited worse than Jove
	in a thatched house

TOUCHSTONE	When a mans verses cannot be understood nor a
	mans good wit seconded with the forward child
	Understanding it strikes a man more dead than a
	great reckoning in a little room Truly I would
	the gods had made thee poetical

AUDREY	I do not know what poetical is is it honest in
	deed and word? is it a true thing?

TOUCHSTONE	No truly for the truest poetry is the most
	feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what
	they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign

AUDREY	Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?

TOUCHSTONE	I do truly for thou swearest to me thou art
	honest now if thou wert a poet I might have some
	hope thou didst feign

AUDREY	Would you not have me honest?

TOUCHSTONE	No truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for
	honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar

JAQUES	Aside  A material fool

AUDREY	 Well I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods
	make me honest

TOUCHSTONE	Truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
	were to put good meat into an unclean dish

AUDREY	I am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foul

TOUCHSTONE	Well praised be the gods for thy foulness
	sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may
	be I will marry thee and to that end I have been
	with Sir Oliver Martext the vicar of the next
	village who hath promised to meet me in this place
	of the forest and to couple us

JAQUES	Aside  I would fain see this meeting

AUDREY	Well the gods give us joy

TOUCHSTONE	Amen A man may if he were of a fearful heart
	stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple
	but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts But what
	though? Courage As horns are odious they are
	necessary It is said many a man knows no end of
	his goods right many a man has good horns and
	knows no end of them Well that is the dowry of
	his wife tis none of his own getting Horns?
	Even so Poor men alone? No no the noblest deer
	hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man
	therefore blessed? No as a walled town is more
	worthier than a village so is the forehead of a
	married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
	bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
	skill by so much is a horn more precious than to
	want Here comes Sir Oliver

	Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

	Sir Oliver Martext you are well met will you
	dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go
	with you to your chapel?

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Is there none here to give the woman?

TOUCHSTONE	I will not take her on gift of any man

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful

JAQUES	Advancing

	Proceed proceed	Ill give her

TOUCHSTONE	Good even good Master Whatyecallt how do you
	sir? You are very well met God ild you for your
	last company I am very glad to see you even a
	toy in hand here sir nay pray be covered

JAQUES	Will you be married motley?

TOUCHSTONE	As the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and
	the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and
	as pigeons bill so wedlock would be nibbling

JAQUES	And will you being a man of your breeding be
	married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
	church and have a good priest that can tell you
	what marriage is this fellow will but join you
	together as they join wainscot then one of you will
	prove a shrunk panel and like green timber warp warp

TOUCHSTONE	Aside  I am not in the mind but I were better to be
	married of him than of another for he is not like
	to marry me well and not being well married it
	will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife

JAQUES	Go thou with me and let me counsel thee

TOUCHSTONE	Come sweet Audrey
	We must be married or we must live in bawdry
	Farewell good Master Oliver not
	O sweet Oliver
	O brave Oliver
	Leave me not behind thee but
	Wind away
	Begone I say
	I will not to wedding with thee

	Exeunt JAQUES TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Tis no matter neer a fantastical knave of them
	all shall flout me out of my calling

SCENE IV	The forest


	Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

ROSALIND	Never talk to me I will weep

CELIA	Do I prithee but yet have the grace to consider
	that tears do not become a man

ROSALIND	But have I not cause to weep?

CELIA	As good cause as one would desire therefore weep

ROSALIND	His very hair is of the dissembling colour

CELIA	Something browner than Judass marry his kisses are
	Judass own children

ROSALIND	I faith his hair is of a good colour

CELIA	An excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour

ROSALIND	And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
	of holy bread

CELIA	He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana a nun
	of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously
	the very ice of chastity is in them

ROSALIND	But why did he swear he would come this morning and
	comes not?

CELIA	Nay certainly there is no truth in him

ROSALIND	Do you think so?

CELIA	Yes I think he is not a pickpurse nor a
	horsestealer but for his verity in love I do
	think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
	wormeaten nut

ROSALIND	Not true in love?

CELIA	Yes when he is in but I think he is not in

ROSALIND	You have heard him swear downright he was

CELIA	Was is not is besides the oath of a lover is
	no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
	both the confirmer of false reckonings He attends
	here in the forest on the duke your father

ROSALIND	I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
	him he asked me of what parentage I was I told
	him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go
	But what talk we of fathers when there is such a
	man as Orlando?

CELIA	O thats a brave man he writes brave verses
	speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks
	them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of
	his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse
	but on one side breaks his staff like a noble
	goose but alls brave that youth mounts and folly
	guides Who comes here?

	Enter CORIN

CORIN	Mistress and master you have oft inquired
	After the shepherd that complaind of love
	Who you saw sitting by me on the turf
	Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
	That was his mistress

CELIA	Well and what of him?

CORIN	If you will see a pageant truly playd
	Between the pale complexion of true love
	And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
	Go hence a little and I shall conduct you
	If you will mark it

ROSALIND	O come let us remove
	The sight of lovers feedeth those in love
	Bring us to this sight and you shall say
	Ill prove a busy actor in their play

	Exeunt

SCENE V	Another part of the forest


	Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe do not scorn me do not Phebe
	Say that you love me not but say not so
	In bitterness The common executioner
	Whose heart the accustomd sight of death makes hard
	Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
	But first begs pardon will you sterner be
	Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?

	Enter ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN behind

PHEBE	I would not be thy executioner
	I fly thee for I would not injure thee
	Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye
	Tis pretty sure and very probable
	That eyes that are the frailst and softest things
	Who shut their coward gates on atomies
	Should be calld tyrants butchers murderers
	Now I do frown on thee with all my heart
	And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
	Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
	Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame
	Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
	Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
	Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
	Some scar of it lean but upon a rush
	The cicatrice and capable impressure
	Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
	Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not
	Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
	That can do hurt

SILVIUS	                  O dear Phebe
	If everas that ever may be near
	You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
	Then shall you know the wounds invisible
	That loves keen arrows make

PHEBE	But till that time
	Come not thou near me and when that time comes
	Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
	As till that time I shall not pity thee

ROSALIND	And why I pray you? Who might be your mother
	That you insult exult and all at once
	Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty
	As by my faith I see no more in you
	Than without candle may go dark to bed
	Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
	Why what means this? Why do you look on me?
	I see no more in you than in the ordinary
	Of natures salework Ods my little life
	I think she means to tangle my eyes too
	No faith proud mistress hope not after it
	Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
	Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
	That can entame my spirits to your worship
	You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
	Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
	You are a thousand times a properer man
	Than she a woman tis such fools as you
	That makes the world full of illfavourd children
	Tis not her glass but you that flatters her
	And out of you she sees herself more proper
	Than any of her lineaments can show her
	But mistress know yourself down on your knees
	And thank heaven fasting for a good mans love
	For I must tell you friendly in your ear
	Sell when you can you are not for all markets
	Cry the man mercy love him take his offer
	Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
	So take her to thee shepherd fare you well

PHEBE	Sweet youth I pray you chide a year together
	I had rather hear you chide than this man woo

ROSALIND	Hes fallen in love with your foulness and shell
	fall in love with my anger If it be so as fast as
	she answers thee with frowning looks Ill sauce her
	with bitter words Why look you so upon me?

PHEBE	For no ill will I bear you

ROSALIND	I pray you do not fall in love with me
	For I am falser than vows made in wine
	Besides I like you not If you will know my house
	Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
	Will you go sister? Shepherd ply her hard
	Come sister Shepherdess look on him better
	And be not proud though all the world could see
	None could be so abused in sight as he
	Come to our flock

	Exeunt ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN

PHEBE	Dead Shepherd now I find thy saw of might
	Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe
