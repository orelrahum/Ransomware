Overview

    living standards and high dependence on foreign trade Denmark probably
    will continue its successful economic recovery in  with tight fiscal and
    monetary policies and export oriented growth Prime Minister Schluters
    main priorities are to maintain a current account surplus in order to pay
    off extensive external debt and to continue to freeze publicsector
    expenditures in order to reduce the budget deficit The rate of growth by
      boosted by increased investment and domestic demand  may be
    sufficient to start to cut Denmarks high unemployment rate which is
    expected to remain at about  in  Low inflation low wage increases
    and the current account surplus put Denmark in a good competitive position

Djibouti Economy

Overview
    The economy is based on service activities connected with the countrys
    strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa
    Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
    international transshipment and refueling center It has few natural
    resources and little industry The nation is therefore heavily dependent
    on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
    development projects An unemployment rate of over  continues to be a
    major problem Per capita consumption dropped an estimated  over the last
    five years because of recession and a high population growth rate including
    immigrants and refugees
