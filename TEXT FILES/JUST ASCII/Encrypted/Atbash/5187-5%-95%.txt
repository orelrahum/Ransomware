Greenland Economy

Overview
    Over the past  years the economy has changed from one based on
    subsistence whaling hunting and fishing to one dependent on foreign trade
    Fishing is still the most important industry accounting for over  of
    exports and about  of the populations income Maintenance of a social
    welfare system similar to Denmarks has given the public sector a dominant
    role in the economy In  the economy became critically dependent on
    shrimp exports and on an annual subsidy now about  million from the
    Danish Government because cod exports dropped off and commercial mineral
    production stopped As of  the government also has taken control of the
    health sector from Denmark The new Home Rule government installed in March
     has decided to end much of the central control of the economy and to
    open it wider to competitive forces
