Gave sign of gratulation and each hill
Joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs
Whispered it to the woods and from their wings
Flung rose flung odours from the spicy shrub
Disporting till the amorous bird of night
Sung spousal and bid haste the eveningstar
On his hill top to light the bridal lamp
Thus have I told thee all my state and brought
My story to the sum of earthly bliss
Which I enjoy and must confess to find
In all things else delight indeed but such
As used or not works in the mind no change
Nor vehement desire these delicacies
I mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flowers
Walks and the melody of birds but here
Far otherwise transported I behold
Transported touch here passion first I felt
Commotion strange in all enjoyments else
Superiour and unmoved here only weak
Against the charm of Beautys powerful glance
Or Nature failed in me and left some part
Not proof enough such object to sustain
Or from my side subducting took perhaps
More than enough at least on her bestowed
Too much of ornament in outward show
Elaborate of inward less exact
For well I understand in the prime end
Of Nature her the inferiour in the mind
And inward faculties which most excel
In outward also her resembling less
His image who made both and less expressing
The character of that dominion given
Oer other creatures  Yet when I approach
Her loveliness so absolute she seems
And in herself complete so well to know
Her own that what she wills to do or say
Seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best
All higher knowledge in her presence falls
Degraded  Wisdom in discourse with her
Loses discountenanced and like Folly shows
Authority and Reason on her wait
As one intended first not after made
Occasionally and to consummate all
Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat
Build in her loveliest and create an awe
About her as a guard angelick placed
To whom the Angel with contracted brow
Accuse not Nature she hath done her part
Do thou but thine and be not diffident
Of Wisdom she deserts thee not if thou
Dismiss not her when most thou needest her nigh
By attributing overmuch to things
Less excellent as thou thyself perceivest
For what admirest thou what transports thee so
An outside? fair no doubt and worthy well
Thy cherishing thy honouring and thy love
Not thy subjection  Weigh with her thyself
Then value  Ofttimes nothing profits more
Than selfesteem grounded on just and right
Well managed of that skill the more thou knowest
The more she will acknowledge thee her head
And to realities yield all her shows
Made so adorn for thy delight the more
So awful that with honour thou mayest love
Thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind
Is propagated seem such dear delight
Beyond all other think the same vouchsafed
To cattle and each beast which would not be
To them made common and divulged if aught
Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue
The soul of man or passion in him move
What higher in her society thou findest
Attractive human rational love still
In loving thou dost well in passion not
Wherein true love consists not  Love refines
The thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat
In reason and is judicious is the scale
By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend
Not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause
Among the beasts no mate for thee was found
To whom thus half abashed Adam replied
Neither her outside formed so fair nor aught
In procreation common to all kinds
Though higher of the genial bed by far
And with mysterious reverence I deem
So much delights me as those graceful acts
Those thousand decencies that daily flow
From all her words and actions mixed with love
And sweet compliance which declare unfeigned
Union of mind or in us both one soul
Harmony to behold in wedded pair
More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear
Yet these subject not I to thee disclose
What inward thence I feel not therefore foiled
Who meet with various objects from the sense
Variously representing yet still free
Approve the best and follow what I approve
To love thou blamest me not for Love thou sayest
Leads up to Heaven is both the way and guide
Bear with me then if lawful what I ask
Love not the heavenly Spirits and how their love
Express they? by looks only? or do they mix
Irradiance virtual or immediate touch?
To whom the Angel with a smile that glowed
Celestial rosy red Loves proper hue
Answered  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest
Us happy and without love no happiness
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest
And pure thou wert created we enjoy
In eminence and obstacle find none
Of membrane joint or limb exclusive bars
Easier than air with air if Spirits embrace
Total they mix union of pure with pure
Desiring nor restrained conveyance need
As flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul
But I can now no more the parting sun
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles
Hesperian sets my signal to depart
Be strong live happy and love  But first of all
Him whom to love is to obey and keep
His great command take heed lest passion sway
Thy judgement to do aught which else free will
Would not admit thine and of all thy sons
The weal or woe in thee is placed beware
I in thy persevering shall rejoice
And all the Blest  Stand fastto stand or fall
Free in thine own arbitrement it lies
Perfect within no outward aid require
And all temptation to transgress repel
So saying he arose whom Adam thus
Followed with benediction  Since to part
Go heavenly guest ethereal Messenger
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore
Gentle to me and affable hath been
Thy condescension and shall be honoured ever
With grateful memory  Thou to mankind
Be good and friendly still and oft return
So parted they the Angel up to Heaven
From the thick shade and Adam to his bower



Book IX


No more of talk where God or Angel guest
With Man as with his friend familiar usd
To sit indulgent and with him partake
Rural repast permitting him the while
Venial discourse unblamd I now must change
Those notes to tragick foul distrust and breach
Disloyal on the part of Man revolt
And disobedience on the part of Heaven
Now alienated distance and distaste
Anger and just rebuke and judgement given
That brought into this world a world of woe
Sin and her shadow Death and Misery
Deaths harbinger Sad talkyet argument
Not less but more heroick than the wrath
Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued
Thrice fugitive about Troy wall or rage
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespousd
Or Neptunes ire or Junos that so long
Perplexed the Greek and Cythereas son

   
If answerable style I can obtain
Of my celestial patroness who deigns
Her nightly visitation unimplord
And dictates to me slumbering or inspires
Easy my unpremeditated verse
Since first this subject for heroick song
Pleasd me long choosing and beginning late
Not sedulous by nature to indite
Wars hitherto the only argument
Heroick deemd chief mastery to dissect
With long and tedious havock fabled knights
In battles feignd the better fortitude
Of patience and heroick martyrdom
Unsung or to describe races and games
Or tilting furniture imblazond shields
Impresses quaint caparisons and steeds
Bases and tinsel trappings gorgeous knights
At joust and tournament then marshalld feast
Servd up in hall with sewers and seneshals
The skill of artifice or office mean
Not that which justly gives heroick name
To person or to poem  Me of these
Nor skilld nor studious higher argument
Remains sufficient of itself to raise
That name unless an age too late or cold
Climate or years damp my intended wing
Depressd and much they may if all be mine
Not hers who brings it nightly to my ear
The sun was sunk and after him the star
Of Hesperus whose office is to bring
Twilight upon the earth short arbiter
"twixt day and night and now from end to end
Nights hemisphere had veild the horizon round
When satan who late fled before the threats
Of Gabriel out of Eden now improvd
In meditated fraud and malice bent
On Mans destruction maugre what might hap
Of heavier on himself fearless returned
From compassing the earth cautious of day
Since Uriel regent of the sun descried
His entrance and foreworned the Cherubim
That kept their watch thence full of anguish driven
The space of seven continued nights he rode
With darkness thrice the equinoctial line
He circled four times crossed the car of night
From pole to pole traversing each colure
On the eighth returned and on the coast averse
From entrance or Cherubick watch by stealth
Found unsuspected way  There was a place
Now not though sin not time first wrought the change
Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise
Into a gulf shot under ground till part
Rose up a fountain by the tree of life
In with the river sunk and with it rose
Satan involved in rising mist then sought
Where to lie hid sea he had searched and land
From Eden over Pontus and the pool
Maeotis up beyond the river Ob
Downward as far antarctick and in length
West from Orontes to the ocean barred
At Darien  thence to the land where flows
Ganges and Indus Thus the orb he roamed
With narrow search and with inspection deep
Considered every creature which of all
Most opportune might serve his wiles and found
The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field
Him after long debate irresolute
Of thoughts revolved his final sentence chose
Fit vessel fittest imp of fraud in whom
To enter and his dark suggestions hide
From sharpest sight for in the wily snake
Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark
As from his wit and native subtlety
Proceeding which in other beasts observed
Doubt might beget of diabolick power
Active within beyond the sense of brute
Thus he resolved but first from inward grief
His bursting passion into plaints thus poured
More justly seat worthier of Gods as built
With second thoughts reforming what was old
O Earth how like to Heaven if not preferred
For what God after better worse would build?
Terrestrial Heaven danced round by other Heavens
That shine yet bear their bright officious lamps
Light above light for thee alone as seems
In thee concentring all their precious beams
Of sacred influence  As God in Heaven
Is center yet extends to all so thou
Centring receivest from all those orbs in thee
Not in themselves all their known virtue appears
Productive in herb plant and nobler birth
Of creatures animate with gradual life
Of growth sense reason all summed up in Man
With what delight could I have walked thee round
If I could joy in aught sweet interchange
Of hill and valley rivers woods and plains
Now land now sea and shores with forest crowned
Rocks dens and caves  But I in none of these
Find place or refuge and the more I see
Pleasures about me so much more I feel
Torment within me as from the hateful siege
Of contraries all good to me becomes
Bane and in Heaven much worse would be my state
But neither here seek I no nor in Heaven
To dwell unless by mastering Heavens Supreme
Nor hope to be myself less miserable
By what I seek but others to make such
As I though thereby worse to me redound
For only in destroying I find ease
To my relentless thoughts and him destroyed
Or won to what may work his utter loss
For whom all this was made all this will soon
Follow as to him linked in weal or woe
In woe then that destruction wide may range
To me shall be the glory sole among
The infernal Powers in one day to have marred
What he Almighty styled six nights and days
Continued making and who knows how long
Before had been contriving? though perhaps
Not longer than since I in one night freed
From servitude inglorious well nigh half
The angelick name and thinner left the throng
Of his adorers He to be avenged
And to repair his numbers thus impaired
Whether such virtue spent of old now failed
More Angels to create if they at least
Are his created or to spite us more
Determined to advance into our room
A creature formed of earth and him endow
Exalted from so base original
With heavenly spoils our spoils What he decreed
He effected Man he made and for him built
Magnificent this world and earth his seat
Him lord pronounced and O indignity
Subjected to his service angelwings
And flaming ministers to watch and tend
Their earthly charge Of these the vigilance
I dread and to elude thus wrapt in mist
Of midnight vapour glide obscure and pry
In every bush and brake where hap may find
The serpent sleeping in whose mazy folds
To hide me and the dark intent I bring
O foul descent that I who erst contended
With Gods to sit the highest am now constrained
Into a beast and mixed with bestial slime
This essence to incarnate and imbrute
That to the highth of Deity aspired
But what will not ambition and revenge
Descend to?  Who aspires must down as low
As high he soared obnoxious first or last
To basest things  Revenge at first though sweet
Bitter ere long back on itself recoils
Let it I reck not so it light well aimed
Since higher I fall short on him who next
Provokes my envy this new favourite
Of Heaven this man of clay son of despite
Whom us the more to spite his Maker raised
From dust Spite then with spite is best repaid
So saying through each thicket dank or dry
Like a black mist lowcreeping he held on
His midnightsearch where soonest he might find
The serpent him fastsleeping soon he found
In labyrinth of many a round selfrolled
His head the midst well stored with subtile wiles
Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den
Nor nocent yet but on the grassy herb
Fearless unfeared he slept in at his mouth
The Devil entered and his brutal sense
In heart or head possessing soon inspired
With act intelligential but his sleep
Disturbed not waiting close the approach of morn
Now when as sacred light began to dawn
In Eden on the humid flowers that breathed
Their morning incense when all things that breathe
From the Earths great altar send up silent praise
To the Creator and his nostrils fill
With grateful smell forth came the human pair
And joined their vocal worship to the quire
Of creatures wanting voice that done partake
The season prime for sweetest scents and airs
Then commune how that day they best may ply
Their growing work for much their work outgrew
The hands dispatch of two gardening so wide
And Eve first to her husband thus began
Adam well may we labour still to dress
This garden still to tend plant herb and flower
Our pleasant task enjoined but till more hands
Aid us the work under our labour grows
Luxurious by restraint what we by day
Lop overgrown or prune or prop or bind
One night or two with wanton growth derides
Tending to wild  Thou therefore now advise
Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present
Let us divide our labours thou where choice
Leads thee or where most needs whether to wind
The woodbine round this arbour or direct
The clasping ivy where to climb while I
In yonder spring of roses intermixed
With myrtle find what to redress till noon
For while so near each other thus all day
Our task we choose what wonder if so near
Looks intervene and smiles or object new
Casual discourse draw on which intermits
Our days work brought to little though begun
Early and the hour of supper comes unearned?
To whom mild answer Adam thus returned
Sole Eve associate sole to me beyond
Compare above all living creatures dear
Well hast thou motioned well thy thoughts employed
How we might best fulfil the work which here
God hath assigned us nor of me shalt pass
Unpraised for nothing lovelier can be found
In woman than to study houshold good
And good works in her husband to promote
Yet not so strictly hath our Lord imposed
Labour as to debar us when we need
Refreshment whether food or talk between
Food of the mind or this sweet intercourse
Of looks and smiles for smiles from reason flow
To brute denied and are of love the food
Love not the lowest end of human life
For not to irksome toil but to delight
He made us and delight to reason joined
These paths and bowers doubt not but our joint hands
Will keep from wilderness with ease as wide
As we need walk till younger hands ere long
Assist us But if much converse perhaps
Thee satiate to short absence I could yield
For solitude sometimes is best society
And short retirement urges sweet return
But other doubt possesses me lest harm
Befall thee severed from me for thou knowest
What hath been warned us what malicious foe
Envying our happiness and of his own
Despairing seeks to work us woe and shame
By sly assault and somewhere nigh at hand
Watches no doubt with greedy hope to find
His wish and best advantage us asunder
Hopeless to circumvent us joined where each
To other speedy aid might lend at need
Whether his first design be to withdraw
Our fealty from God or to disturb
Conjugal love than which perhaps no bliss
Enjoyed by us excites his envy more
Or this or worse leave not the faithful side
That gave thee being still shades thee and protects
The wife where danger or dishonour lurks
Safest and seemliest by her husband stays
Who guards her or with her the worst endures
To whom the virgin majesty of Eve
As one who loves and some unkindness meets
With sweet austere composure thus replied
Offspring of Heaven and Earth and all Earths Lord
That such an enemy we have who seeks
Our ruin both by thee informed I learn
And from the parting Angel overheard
As in a shady nook I stood behind
Just then returned at shut of evening flowers
But that thou shouldst my firmness therefore doubt
To God or thee because we have a foe
May tempt it I expected not to hear
His violence thou fearest not being such
As we not capable of death or pain
Can either not receive or can repel
His fraud is then thy fear which plain infers
Thy equal fear that my firm faith and love
Can by his fraud be shaken or seduced
Thoughts which how found they harbour in thy breast
Adam misthought of her to thee so dear?
To whom with healing words Adam replied
Daughter of God and Man immortal Eve
For such thou art from sin and blame entire
Not diffident of thee do I dissuade
Thy absence from my sight but to avoid
The attempt itself intended by our foe
For he who tempts though in vain at least asperses
The tempted with dishonour foul supposed
Not incorruptible of faith not proof
Against temptation Thou thyself with scorn
And anger wouldst resent the offered wrong
Though ineffectual found misdeem not then
If such affront I labour to avert
From thee alone which on us both at once
The enemy though bold will hardly dare
Or daring first on me the assault shall light
Nor thou his malice and false guile contemn
Subtle he needs must be who could seduce
Angels nor think superfluous others aid
I from the influence of thy looks receive
Access in every virtue in thy sight
More wise more watchful stronger if need were
Of outward strength while shame thou looking on
Shame to be overcome or overreached
Would utmost vigour raise and raised unite
Why shouldst not thou like sense within thee feel
When I am present and thy trial choose
With me best witness of thy virtue tried?
So spake domestick Adam in his care
And matrimonial love but Eve who thought
Less attributed to her faith sincere
Thus her reply with accent sweet renewed
If this be our condition thus to dwell
In narrow circuit straitened by a foe
Subtle or violent we not endued
Single with like defence wherever met
How are we happy still in fear of harm?
But harm precedes not sin only our foe
Tempting affronts us with his foul esteem
Of our integrity his foul esteem
Sticks no dishonour on our front but turns
Foul on himself then wherefore shunned or feared
By us? who rather double honour gain
From his surmise proved false find peace within
Favour from Heaven our witness from the event
And what is faith love virtue unassayed
Alone without exteriour help sustained?
Let us not then suspect our happy state
Left so imperfect by the Maker wise
As not secure to single or combined
Frail is our happiness if this be so
And Eden were no Eden thus exposed
To whom thus Adam fervently replied
O Woman best are all things as the will
Of God ordained them His creating hand
Nothing imperfect or deficient left
Of all that he created much less Man
Or aught that might his happy state secure
Secure from outward force within himself
The danger lies yet lies within his power
Against his will he can receive no harm
But God left free the will for what obeys
Reason is free and Reason he made right
But bid her well be ware and still erect
Lest by some fairappearing good surprised
She dictate false and misinform the will
To do what God expressly hath forbid
Not then mistrust but tender love enjoins
That I should mind thee oft and mind thou me
Firm we subsist yet possible to swerve
Since Reason not impossibly may meet
Some specious object by the foe suborned
And fall into deception unaware
Not keeping strictest watch as she was warned
Seek not temptation then which to avoid
Were better and most likely if from me
Thou sever not Trial will come unsought
Wouldst thou approve thy constancy approve
First thy obedience the other who can know
Not seeing thee attempted who attest?
But if thou think trial unsought may find
Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest
Go for thy stay not free absents thee more
Go in thy native innocence rely
On what thou hast of virtue summon all
For God towards thee hath done his part do thine
So spake the patriarch of mankind but Eve
Persisted yet submiss though last replied
With thy permission then and thus forewarned
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
Touched only that our trial when least sought
May find us both perhaps far less prepared
The willinger I go nor much expect
A foe so proud will first the weaker seek
So bent the more shall shame him his repulse
Thus saying from her husbands hand her hand
Soft she withdrew and like a WoodNymph light
Oread or Dryad or of Delias train
Betook her to the groves but Delias self
In gait surpassed and Goddesslike deport
Though not as she with bow and quiver armed
But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude
Guiltless of fire had formed or Angels brought
To Pales or Pomona thus adorned
Likest she seemed Pomona when she fled
Vertumnus or to Ceres in her prime
Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove
Her long with ardent look his eye pursued
Delighted but desiring more her stay
Oft he to her his charge of quick return
Repeated she to him as oft engaged
To be returned by noon amid the bower
And all things in best order to invite
Noontide repast or afternoons repose
O much deceived much failing hapless Eve
Of thy presumed return event perverse
Thou never from that hour in Paradise
Foundst either sweet repast or sound repose
Such ambush hid among sweet flowers and shades
Waited with hellish rancour imminent
To intercept thy way or send thee back
Despoiled of innocence of faith of bliss
For now and since first break of dawn the Fiend
Mere serpent in appearance forth was come
And on his quest where likeliest he might find
The only two of mankind but in them
The whole included race his purposed prey
In bower and field he sought where any tuft
Of grove or gardenplot more pleasant lay
Their tendance or plantation for delight
By fountain or by shady rivulet
He sought them both but wished his hap might find
Eve separate he wished but not with hope
