Paraguay Economy

Overview
    Agriculture including forestry accounts for about  of GDP employs
    about  of the labor force and provides the bulk of exports Paraguay has
    no known significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
    hydropower potential Since  economic performance has declined compared
    with the boom period of  when real GDP grew at an average annual
    rate of nearly  During the period  real GDP fell in three of five
    years inflation jumped to an annual rate of  and foreign debt rose
    Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the
    completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam bad weather for crops and weak
    international commodity prices for agricultural exports In  the economy
    experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditioMH ZMW
