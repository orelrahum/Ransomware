Uganda Economy

Overview
    Uganda has substantial natural resources including fertile soils regular
    rainfall and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt The economy has
    been devastated by widespread political instability mismanagement and
    civil war since independence in  keeping Uganda poor with a per capita
    income of about  GDP remains below the levels of the early s as
    does industrial production Agriculture is the most important sector of the
    economy employing over  of the work force Coffee is the major export
    crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues Since  the government
    has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency
    reform raising producer prices on export crops increasing petroleum
    prices and improving civil service wages The policy changes are especially
    aimed at dampening inflation which was running at over  in  and
    boosting production and export earnings During the period  the
    economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
    rehabilitation of infrastructure improved incentives for production and
    exports and gradually improving domestic security

Ukraine Economy

Overview
    Because of its size geographic location Slavic population and rich
    resources the loss of Ukraine was the final and most bitter blow to the
    Soviet leaders wishing to preserve some semblance of the old political
    military and economic power of the USSR After Russia the Ukrainian
    republic was far and away the most important economic component of the
    former Soviet Union producing more than three times the output of the
    nextranking republic Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth
    of Soviet agricultural output and its farms provided substantial quantities
    of meat milk grain and vegetables to other republics Likewise its
    welldeveloped and diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw
    materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the USSR In
    early  the continued wholesale disruption of economic ties and the lack
    of an institutional structure necessary to formulate and implement economic
    reforms preclude a nearterm recovery of output
