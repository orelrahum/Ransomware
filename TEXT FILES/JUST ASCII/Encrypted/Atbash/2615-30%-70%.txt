  An arm you goose   Who ever saw one that size?  Why it
fills the whole window

  Sure it does yer honour  but its an arm for all that

  Well its got no business there at any rate  go and take it
away

  There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then such as Sure I dont like it yer
honour at all at all  Do as I tell you you coward and at
last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in
the air  This time there were TWO little shrieks and more
sounds of broken glass  What a number of cucumberframes there
must be thought Alice  I wonder what theyll do next  As for
pulling me out of the window I only wish they COULD  Im sure I
dont want to stay in here any longer

  She waited for some time without hearing anything more  at
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a
good many voice all talking together  she made out the words
Wheres the other ladder?Why I hadnt to bring but one
Bills got the otherBill fetch it here ladHere put em up
at this cornerNo tie em together firstthey dont reach half
high enough yetOh theyll do well enough dont be particular
Here Bill catch hold of this ropeWill the roof bear?Mind
that loose slateOh its coming down  Heads below a loud
crashNow who did that?It was Bill I fancyWhos to go
down the chimney?Nay I shant YOU do itThat I wont
thenBills to go downHere Bill the master says youre to
go down the chimney

  Oh So Bills got to come down the chimney has he? said
Alice to herself  Shy they seem to put everything upon Bill
I wouldnt be in Bills place for a good deal  this fireplace is
narrow to be sure but I THINK I can kick a little

  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and
waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what
sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above her  then saying to herself This is Bill she gave one
sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next

  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes
Bill then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him you by the
hedge then silence and then another confusion of voicesHold
up his headBrandy nowDont choke himHow was it old fellow?
What happened to you?  Tell us all about it

  Last came a little feeble squeaking voice Thats Bill
thought Alice Well I hardly knowNo more thank ye Im
better nowbut Im a deal too flustered to tell youall I know
is something comes at me like a Jackinthebox and up I goes
like a skyrocket

  So you did old fellow said the others

  We must burn the house down said the Rabbits voice and
Alice called out as loud as she could If you do  Ill set
Dinah at you

  There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to
herself I wonder what they WILL do next  If they had any
sense theyd take the roof off  After a minute or two they
began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say A
barrowful will do to begin with

  A barrowful of WHAT? thought Alice but she had not long to
doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face
Ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out
Youd better not do that again which produced another dead
silence

  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright
idea came into her head  If I eat one of these cakes she
thought its sure to make SOME change in my size and as it
cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I
suppose

  So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find
that she began shrinking directly  As soon as she was small
enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and
found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
The poor little Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by
two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she
ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a
thick wood

  The first thing Ive got to do said Alice to herself as she
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
I think that will be the best plan

  It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and
simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the
smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering
about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over
her head made her look up in a great hurry

  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her
Poor little thing said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried
hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the
time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it
would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing

  Hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of
stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped
into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight
and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then Alice
dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run
over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy
made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very
like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle
again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long
way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat
down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its
mouth and its great eyes half shut

  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape
so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out
of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the
distance

  And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she
leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself
with one of the leaves  I should have liked teaching it tricks
very much ifif Id only been the right size to do it  Oh
dear  Id nearly forgotten that Ive got to grow up again  Let
me seehow IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or
drink something or other but the great question is what?

  The great question certainly was what?  Alice looked all round
her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
the circumstances  There was a large mushroom growing near her
about the same height as herself and when she had looked under
it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it

  She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of
the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large
caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded
quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of anything else



                            CHAPTER V

                    Advice from a Caterpillar


  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice

  Who are YOU? said the Caterpillar

  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  Alice
replied rather shyly II hardly know sir just at present
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning but I think
I must have been changed several times since then

  What do you mean by that? said the Caterpillar sternly
Explain yourself

  I cant explain MYSELF Im afraid sir said Alice because
Im not myself you see

  I dont see said the Caterpillar

  Im afraid I cant put it more clearly Alice replied very
politely for I cant understand it myself to begin with and
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing

  It isnt said the Caterpillar

  Well perhaps you havent found it so yet said Alice but
