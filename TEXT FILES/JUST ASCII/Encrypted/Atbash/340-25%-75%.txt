Greece Economy

Overview
    Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic entrepreneurial
    system overlaid in  by a socialist government that enlarged the
    public sector from  of GDP in  to about  when Prime Minister
    Mitsotakis took office Tourism continues as a major industry and
    agriculture  although handicapped by geographic limitations and fragmented
    small farms  is selfsufficient except for meat dairy products and animal
    feedstuffs The Mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic
    problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations which
    had neglected the runaway budget deficit a ballooning current account
    deficit and accelerating inflation In early  the government secured a
     billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet
    imposed on a member country as the EC finally ran out of patience with
    Greeces failure to put its financial affairs in order Over the next three
    years Athens must bring inflation down to  cut the current account
    deficit and central government borrowing as a percentage of GDP slash
    publicsector employment by  curb publicsector pay raises and broaden
    the tax base

Greenland Economy

Overview
    Over the past  years the economy has changed from one based on
    subsistence whaling hunting and fishing to one dependent on foreign trade
    Fishing is still the most important industry accounting for over  of
    exports and about  of the populations income Maintenance of a social
    welfare system similar to Denmarks has given the public sector a dominant
    role in the economy In  the economy became critically dependent on
    shrimp exports and on an annual subsidy now about  million from the
    Danish Government because cod exports dropped off and commercial mineral
    production stopped As of  the government also has taken control of the
    health sector from Denmark The new Home Rule government installed in March
     has decided to end much of the central control of the economy and to
    open it wider to competitive forces
