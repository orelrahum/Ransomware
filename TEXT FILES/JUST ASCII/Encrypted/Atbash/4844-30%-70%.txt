  Oh you cant help that said the Cat  were all mad here
Im mad  Youre mad

  How do you know Im mad? said Alice

  You must be said the Cat or you wouldnt have come here

  Alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on
And how do you know that youre mad?

  To begin with said the Cat a dogs not mad  You grant
that?

  I suppose so said Alice

  Well then the Cat went on you see a dog growls when its
angry and wags its tail when its pleased  Now I growl when Im
pleased and wag my tail when Im angry  Therefore Im mad

  I call it purring not growling said Alice

  Call it what you like said the Cat  Do you play croquet
with the Queen today?

  I should like it very much said Alice but I havent been
invited yet

  Youll see me there said the Cat and vanished

  Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used
to queer things happening  While she was looking at the place
where it had been it suddenly appeared again

  Bythebye what became of the baby? said the Cat  Id
nearly forgotten to ask

  It turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it had
come back in a natural way

  I thought it would said the Cat and vanished again

  Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it
did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the
direction in which the March Hare was said to live  Ive seen
hatters before she said to herself the March Hare will be
much the most interesting and perhaps as this is May it wont be
raving madat least not so mad as it was in March  As she said
this she looked up and there was the Cat again sitting on a
branch of a tree

  Did you say pig or fig? said the Cat

  I said pig replied Alice and I wish you wouldnt keep
appearing and vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy

  All right said the Cat and this time it vanished quite
slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the
grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone

  Well  Ive often seen a cat without a grin thought Alice
but a grin without a cat  Its the most curious thing I ever
say in my life

  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the
house of the March Hare  she thought it must be the right house
because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was
thatched with fur  It was so large a house that she did not
like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand
bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high  even
then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself
Suppose it should be raving mad after all  I almost wish Id
gone to see the Hatter instead



                           CHAPTER VII

                         A Mad TeaParty


  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house
and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it  a
Dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two
were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and the
talking over its head  Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse
thought Alice only as its asleep I suppose it doesnt mind

  The table was a large one but the three were all crowded
together at one corner of it  No room  No room they cried
out when they saw Alice coming  Theres PLENTY of room said
Alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one
end of the table

  Have some wine the March Hare said in an encouraging tone

  Alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it
but tea  I dont see any wine she remarked

  There isnt any said the March Hare

  Then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said Alice
angrily

  It wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being
invited said the March Hare

  I didnt know it was YOUR table said Alice its laid for a
great many more than three

  Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter  He had been
looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity and this was
his first speech

  You should learn not to make personal remarks Alice said
with some severity its very rude

  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all
he SAID was Why is a raven like a writingdesk?

  Come we shall have some fun now thought Alice  Im glad
theyve begun asking riddlesI believe I can guess that she
added aloud

  Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?
said the March Hare

  Exactly so said Alice

  Then you should say what you mean the March Hare went on

  I do Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what
I saythats the same thing you know

  Not the same thing a bit said the Hatter  You might just
as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat
what I see"

  You might just as well say added the March Hare that "I
like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"

  You might just as well say added the Dormouse who seemed to
be talking in his sleep that "I breathe when I sleep" is the
same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"

  It IS the same thing with you said the Hatter and here the
conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute
while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writingdesks which wasnt much

  The Hatter was the first to break the silence  What day of
the month is it? he said turning to Alice  he had taken his
watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking
it every now and then and holding it to his ear

  Alice considered a little and then said The fourth

  Two days wrong sighed the Hatter  I told you butter
wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the March
Hare

  It was the BEST butter the March Hare meekly replied

  Yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the Hatter
grumbled  you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife

  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then
he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again  but he
could think of nothing better to say than his first remark It
was the BEST butter you know

  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity
What a funny watch she remarked  It tells the day of the
month and doesnt tell what oclock it is

  Why should it? muttered the Hatter  Does YOUR watch tell
you what year it is?

  Of course not Alice replied very readily  but thats
because it stays the same year for such a long time together

  Which is just the case with MINE said the Hatter

  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled  The Hatters remark seemed to
have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly English
I dont quite understand you she said as politely as she
could

  The Dormouse is asleep again said the Hatter and he poured
a little hot tea upon its nose

  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without
opening its eyes Of course of course just what I was going to
remark myself

  Have you guessed the riddle yet? the Hatter said turning to
Alice again

  No I give it up Alice replied  whats the answer?

  I havent the slightest idea said the Hatter

  Nor I said the March Hare

  Alice sighed wearily  I think you might do something better
with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that
have no answers

  If you knew Time as well as I do said the Hatter you
wouldnt talk about wasting IT  Its HIM

  I dont know what you mean said Alice

  Of course you dont the Hatter said tossing his head
contemptuously  I dare say you never even spoke to Time

  Perhaps not Alice cautiously replied  but I know I have to
beat time when I learn music

  Ah that accounts for it said the Hatter  He wont stand
beating  Now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do
almost anything you liked with the clock  For instance suppose
it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons
youd only have to whisper a hint to Time and round goes the
clock in a twinkling  Halfpast one time for dinner

  I only wish it was the March Hare said to itself in a
whisper

  That would be grand certainly said Alice thoughtfully
but thenI shouldnt be hungry for it you know

  Not at first perhaps said the Hatter  but you could keep
it to halfpast one as long as you liked

  Is that the way YOU manage? Alice asked

  The Hatter shook his head mournfully  Not I he replied
We quarrelled last Marchjust before HE went mad you know
pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare it was at the
great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing

            "Twinkle twinkle little bat
            How I wonder what youre at"

You know the song perhaps?

  Ive heard something like it said Alice

  It goes on you know the Hatter continued in this way

            "Up above the world you fly
            Like a teatray in the sky
                    Twinkle twinkle"

Here the Dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep
Twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that
they had to pinch it to make it stop

  Well Id hardly finished the first verse said the Hatter
when the Queen jumped up and bawled out "Hes murdering the
time  Off with his head"

  How dreadfully savage exclaimed Alice

  And ever since that the Hatter went on in a mournful tone
he wont do a thing I ask  Its always six oclock now

  A bright idea came into Alices head  Is that the reason so
many teathings are put out here? she asked

  Yes thats it said the Hatter with a sigh  its always
teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles

  Then you keep moving round I suppose? said Alice

  Exactly so said the Hatter  as the things get used up

  But what happens when you come to the beginning again? Alice
ventured to ask

  Suppose we change the subject the March Hare interrupted
yawning  Im getting tired of this  I vote the young lady
tells us a story

  Im afraid I dont know one said Alice rather alarmed at
the proposal

  Then the Dormouse shall they both cried  Wake up
Dormouse  And they pinched it on both sides at once

  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes  I wasnt asleep he
said in a hoarse feeble voice  I heard every word you fellows
were saying

  Tell us a story said the March Hare

  Yes please do pleaded Alice

  And be quick about it added the Hatter or youll be asleep
again before its done

  Once upon a time there were three little sisters the
Dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were Elsie
Lacie and Tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well

  What did they live on? said Alice who always took a great
interest in questions of eating and drinking

  They lived on treacle said the Dormouse after thinking a
minute or two

  They couldnt have done that you know Alice gently
remarked theyd have been ill

  So they were said the Dormouse VERY ill

  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways
of living would be like but it puzzled her too much so she went
on  But why did they live at the bottom of a well?

  Take some more tea the March Hare said to Alice very
earnestly

  Ive had nothing yet Alice replied in an offended tone so
I cant take more

  You mean you cant take LESS said the Hatter  its very
easy to take MORE than nothing

  Nobody asked YOUR opinion said Alice

  Whos making personal remarks now? the Hatter asked
triumphantly

  Alice did not quite know what to say to this  so she helped
herself to some tea and breadandbutter and then turned to the
Dormouse and repeated her question  Why did they live at the
bottom of a well?

  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it and
then said It was a treaclewell

  Theres no such thing  Alice was beginning very angrily but
the Hatter and the March Hare went Sh sh and the Dormouse
sulkily remarked If you cant be civil youd better finish the
story for yourself

  No please go on Alice said very humbly I wont interrupt
again  I dare say there may be ONE

  One indeed said the Dormouse indignantly  However he
consented to go on  And so these three little sistersthey
were learning to draw you know

  What did they draw? said Alice quite forgetting her promise

  Treacle said the Dormouse without considering at all this
time

  I want a clean cup interrupted the Hatter  lets all move
one place on

  He moved on as he spoke and the Dormouse followed him  the
March Hare moved into the Dormouses place and Alice rather
unwillingly took the place of the March Hare  The Hatter was the
only one who got any advantage from the change  and Alice was a
good deal worse off than before as the March Hare had just upset
the milkjug into his plate

  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again so she began
very cautiously  But I dont understand  Where did they draw
the treacle from?

  You can draw water out of a waterwell said the Hatter so
I should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh
stupid?

  But they were IN the well Alice said to the Dormouse not
choosing to notice this last remark

  Of course they were said the Dormouse well in

  This answer so confused poor Alice that she let the Dormouse
go on for some time without interrupting it

  They were learning to draw the Dormouse went on yawning and
rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew
all manner of thingseverything that begins with an M

  Why with an M? said Alice

  Why not? said the March Hare

  Alice was silent

  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going
off into a doze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up
again with a little shriek and went on  that begins with an
M such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchness
you know you say things are "much of a muchness"did you ever
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?

  Really now you ask me said Alice very much confused I
dont think

  Then you shouldnt talk said the Hatter

  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear  she got
up in great disgust and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep
instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her
going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that
they would call after her  the last time she saw them they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot

  At any rate Ill never go THERE again said Alice as she
picked her way through the wood  Its the stupidest teaparty I
ever was at in all my life

  Just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a
door leading right into it  Thats very curious she thought
But everythings curious today  I think I may as well go in at
once  And in she went

  Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the
little glass table  Now Ill manage better this time she
said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and
unlocking the door that led into the garden  Then she went to
work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her
pocked till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the
little passage  and THENshe found herself at last in the
beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool
fountains



                          CHAPTER VIII

                   The Queens CroquetGround


  A large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden  the
roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at
it busily painting them red  Alice thought this a very curious
thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up
to them she heard one of them say Look out now Five  Dont go
splashing paint over me like that

  I couldnt help it said Five in a sulky tone Seven jogged
my elbow

  On which Seven looked up and said Thats right Five  Always
lay the blame on others

  YOUD better not talk said Five  I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded

  What for? said the one who had spoken first

  Thats none of YOUR business Two said Seven

  Yes it IS his business said Five and Ill tell himit
was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions

  Seven flung down his brush and had just begun Well of all
the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as
she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly  the
others looked round also and all of them bowed low

  Would you tell me said Alice a little timidly why you are
painting those roses?

  Five and Seven said nothing but looked at Two  Two began in a
low voice Why the fact is you see Miss this here ought to
have been a RED rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake
and if the Queen was to find it out we should all have our heads
cut off you know  So you see Miss were doing our best afore
she comes to  At this moment Five who had been anxiously
looking across the garden called out The Queen  The Queen
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
their faces  There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice
looked round eager to see the Queen

  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped
like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and
feet at the corners  next the ten courtiers these were
ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the
soldiers did  After these came the royal children there were
ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
in hand in couples  they were all ornamented with hearts  Next
came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice
recognised the White Rabbit  it was talking in a hurried nervous
manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without
noticing her  Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the
Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this
grand procession came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS

  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on
her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember
every having heard of such a rule at processions and besides
what would be the use of a procession thought she if people
had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see
it?  So she stood still where she was and waited

  When the procession came opposite to Alice they all stopped
and looked at her and the Queen said severely Who is this?
She said it to the Knave of Hearts who only bowed and smiled in
reply

  Idiot said the Queen tossing her head impatiently and
turning to Alice she went on Whats your name child?

  My name is Alice so please your Majesty said Alice very
politely but she added to herself Why theyre only a pack of
cards after all  I neednt be afraid of them

  And who are THESE? said the Queen pointing to the three
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as
they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs
was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether
they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her
own children

  How should I know? said Alice surprised at her own courage
Its no business of MINE

  The Queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her
for a moment like a wild beast screamed Off with her head
Off

  Nonsense said Alice very loudly and decidedly and the
Queen was silent

  The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said
Consider my dear  she is only a child

  The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave
Turn them over

  The Knave did so very carefully with one foot

  Get up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the
three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the
King the Queen the royal children and everybody else

  Leave off that screamed the Queen  You make me giddy
And then turning to the rosetree she went on What HAVE you
been doing here?

  May it please your Majesty said Two in a very humble tone
going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying

  I see said the Queen who had meanwhile been examining the
roses  Off with their heads and the procession moved on
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
gardeners who ran to Alice for protection

  You shant be beheaded said Alice and she put them into a
large flowerpot that stood near  The three soldiers wandered
about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly
marched off after the others

  Are their heads off? shouted the Queen

  Their heads are gone if it please your Majesty the soldiers
shouted in reply

  Thats right shouted the Queen  Can you play croquet?

  The soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question
was evidently meant for her

  Yes shouted Alice

  Come on then roared the Queen and Alice joined the
procession wondering very much what would happen next

  Itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side
She was walking by the White Rabbit who was peeping anxiously
into her face

  Very said Alice  wheres the Duchess?

  Hush  Hush said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone  He
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised
himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and
whispered Shes under sentence of execution

  What for? said Alice

  Did you say "What a pity"? the Rabbit asked

  No I didnt said Alice  I dont think its at all a pity
I said "What for?"

  She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began  Alice gave a
little scream of laughter  Oh hush the Rabbit whispered in a
frightened tone  The Queen will hear you  You see she came
rather late and the Queen said

  Get to your places shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder
and people began running about in all directions tumbling up
against each other however they got settled down in a minute or
two and the game began  Alice thought she had never seen such a
curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and
furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live
flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to
stand on their hands and feet to make the arches

  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her
flamingo  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away
comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down
but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened
out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it
