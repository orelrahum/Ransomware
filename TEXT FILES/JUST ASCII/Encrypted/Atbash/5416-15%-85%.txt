Won from the void and formless infinite
Thee I revisit now with bolder wing
Escapd the Stygian pool though long detaind
In that obscure sojourn while in my flight
Through utter and through middle darkness borne
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre
I sung of Chaos and eternal Night
Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down
The dark descent and up to reascend
Though hard and rare  Thee I revisit safe
And feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou
Revisitst not these eyes that roll in vain
To find thy piercing ray and find no dawn
So  thick a drop serene hath quenchd their orbs
Or dim suffusion veild  Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
Clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill
Smit with the love of sacred song but chief
Thee Sion and the flowery brooks beneath
That wash thy hallowd feet and warbling flow
Nightly I visit  nor sometimes forget
So were I equalld with them in renown
Thy sovran command that Man should find grace
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides
And Tiresias and Phineus prophets old
Then feed on thoughts that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird
Sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid
Tunes her nocturnal note  Thus with the year
Seasons return but not to me returns
Day or the sweet approach of even or morn
Or sight of vernal bloom or summers rose
Or flocks or herds or human face divine
But cloud instead and everduring dark
Surrounds me from the cheerful ways of men
Cut off and for the book of knowledge fair
Presented with a universal blank
Of natures works to me expungd and rasd
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out
So much the rather thou celestial Light
Shine inward and the mind through all her powers
Irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence
Purge and disperse that I may see and tell
Of things invisible to mortal sight
Now had the Almighty Father from above
From the pure empyrean where he sits
High thrond above all highth bent down his eye
His own works and their works at once to view
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
Stood thick as stars and from his sight receivd
Beatitude past utterance on his right
The radiant image of his glory sat
His only son on earth he first beheld
Our two first parents yet the only two
Of mankind in the happy garden placd
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love
Uninterrupted joy unrivalld love
In blissful solitude he then surveyd
Hell and the gulf between and Satan there
Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night
In the dun air sublime and ready now
To stoop with wearied wings and willing feet
On the bare outside of this world that seemd
Firm land imbosomd without firmament
Uncertain which in ocean or in air
Him God beholding from his prospect high
Wherein past present future he beholds
Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake
Only begotten Son seest thou what rage
Transports our Adversary?  whom no bounds
Prescribd no bars of Hell nor all the chains
Heapd on him there nor yet the main abyss
Wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems
On desperate revenge that shall redound
Upon his own rebellious head  And now
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
Not far off Heaven in the precincts of light
Directly towards the new created world
And man there placd with purpose to assay
If him by force he can destroy or worse
By some false guile pervert and shall pervert
For man will hearken to his glozing lies
And easily transgress the sole command
Sole pledge of his obedience  So will fall
He and his faithless progeny  Whose fault?
Whose but his own?  ingrate he had of me
All he could have I made him just and right
Sufficient to have stood though free to fall
Such I created all the ethereal Powers
And Spirits both them who stood and them who faild
Freely they stood who stood and fell who fell
Not free what proof could they have given sincere
Of true allegiance constant faith or love
Where only what they needs must do appeard
Not what they would?  what praise could they receive?
What pleasure I from such obedience paid
When will and reason reason also is choice
Useless and vain of freedom both despoild
Made passive both had servd necessity
Not me?  they therefore as to right belong d
So were created nor can justly accuse
Their Maker or their making or their fate
As if predestination overruld
Their will disposd by absolute decree
Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed
Their own revolt not I if I foreknew
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault
Which had no less proved certain unforeknown
So without least impulse or shadow of fate
Or aught by me immutably foreseen
They trespass authors to themselves in all
Both what they judge and what they choose for so
I formd them free and free they must remain
Till they enthrall themselves I else must change
Their nature and revoke the high decree
Unchangeable eternal which ordaind
THeir freedom they themselves ordaind their fall
The first sort by their own suggestion fell
