Latvia Economy

Overview
    Latvia is in the process of reforming the centrally planned economy
    inherited from the former USSR into a market economy Prices have been
    freed and privatization of shops and farms has begun Latvia lacks natural
    resources aside from its arable land and small forests Its most valuable
    economic asset is its work force which is better educated and disciplined
    than in most of the former Soviet republics Industrial production is highly
    diversified with products ranging from agricultural machinery to consumer
    electronics One conspicuous vulnerability Latvia produces only  of its
    electric power needs Latvia in the near term must retain key commercial
    ties to Russia Belarus and Ukraine while moving in the long run toward
    joint ventures technological support and trade ties to the West Because
    of the efficiency of its mostly individual farms Latvians enjoy a diet that
    is higher in meat vegetables and dairy products and lower in grain and
    potatoes than diets in the  nonBaltic republics of the USSR Good
    relations with Russia are threatened by animosity between ethnic Russians
