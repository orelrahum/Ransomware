	And let him feed

ORLANDO	I thank you most for him

ADAM	So had you need
	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome fall to I will not trouble you
	As yet to question you about your fortunes
	Give us some music and good cousin sing

	SONG
AMIENS	Blow blow thou winter wind
	Thou art not so unkind
	As mans ingratitude
	Thy tooth is not so keen
	Because thou art not seen
	Although thy breath be rude
	Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
	Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
	Then heighho the holly
	This life is most jolly
	Freeze freeze thou bitter sky
	That dost not bite so nigh
	As benefits forgot
	Though thou the waters warp
	Thy sting is not so sharp
	As friend rememberd not
	Heighho sing c

DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowlands son
	As you have whisperd faithfully you were
	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
	Most truly limnd and living in your face
	Be truly welcome hither I am the duke
	That loved your father the residue of your fortune
	Go to my cave and tell me Good old man
	Thou art right welcome as thy master is
	Support him by the arm Give me your hand
	And let me all your fortunes understand

DUKE FREDERICK	Not see him since? Sir sir that cannot be
	But were I not the better part made mercy
	I should not seek an absent argument
	Of my revenge thou present But look to it
	Find out thy brother wheresoeer he is
	Seek him with candle bring him dead or living
	Within this twelvemonth or turn thou no more
	To seek a living in our territory
	Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
	Worth seizure do we seize into our hands
	Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
	Of what we think against thee

OLIVER	O that your highness knew my heart in this
	I never loved my brother in my life

DUKE FREDERICK	More villain thou Well push him out of doors
	And let my officers of such a nature
	Make an extent upon his house and lands
	Do this expediently and turn him going
