Judith ZIDAR coordinator National Agricultural Text Digitizing Program
NATDP National Agricultural Library NAL illustrated the technical
details of NATDP including her primary responsibility scanning and
creating databases on a topic and putting them on CDROM

ZIDAR remarked a separate arena from the CDROM projects although the
processing of the material is nearly identical in which NATDP is also
scanning material and loading it on a Next microcomputer which in turn
is linked to NALs integrated library system  Thus searches in NALs
bibliographic database will enable people to pull up actual page images
and text for any documents that have been entered

In accordance with the sessions topic ZIDAR focused her illustrated
talk on image capture offering a primer on the three main steps in the
process   assemble the printed publications  design the database
database design occurs in the process of preparing the material for
scanning this step entails reviewing and organizing the material
defining the contentswhat will constitute a record what kinds of
fields will be captured in terms of author title etc  perform a
certain amount of markup on the paper publications  NAL performs this
task record by record preparing work sheets or some other sort of
tracking material and designing descriptors and other enhancements to be
added to the data that will not be captured from the printed publication
Part of this process also involves determining NATDPs file and directory
structure  NATDP attempts to avoid putting more than approximately 
images in a directory because placing more than that on a CDROM would
reduce the access speed

This upfront process takes approximately two weeks for a
page database  The next step is to capture the page images
How long this process takes is determined by the decision whether or not
to perform OCR  Not performing OCR speeds the process whereas text
capture requires greater care because of the quality of the image  it
has to be straighter and allowance must be made for text on a page not
just for the capture of photographs

NATDP keys in tracking data that is a standard bibliographic record
including the title of the book and the title of the chapter which will
later either become the access information or will be attached to the
front of a fulltext record so that it is searchable

Images are scanned from a bound or unbound publication chiefly from
bound publications in the case of NATDP however because often they are
the only copies and the publications are returned to the shelves  NATDP
usually scans one record at a time because its database tracking system
tracks the document in that way and does not require further logical
separating of the images  After performing optical character
recognition NATDP moves the images off the hard disk and maintains a
volume sheet  Though the system tracks electronically all the
processing steps are also tracked manually with a log sheet

ZIDAR next illustrated the kinds of adjustments that one can make when
scanning from paper and microfilm for example redoing images that need
special handling setting for dithering or gray scale and adjusting for
brightness or for the whole book at one time

NATDP is scanning at  dots per inch a standard scanning resolution
Though adequate for capturing text that is all of a standard size 
dpi is unsuitable for any kind of photographic material or for very small
text  Many scanners allow for different image formats TIFF of course
being a de facto standard  But if one intends to exchange images with
other people the ability to scan other image formats even if they are
less common becomes highly desirable

CCITT Group  is the standard compression for normal blackandwhite
images JPEG for gray scale or color   ZIDAR recommended  using the
standard compressions particularly if one attempts to make material
available and to allow users to download images and reuse them from
CDROMs and  maintaining the ability to output an uncompressed image
because in image exchange uncompressed images are more likely to be able
to cross platforms

ZIDAR emphasized the importance of deskewing and filtering as
requirements on NATDPs upgraded system  For instance scanning bound
books particularly books published by the federal government whose pages
are skewed and trying to scan them straight if OCR is to be performed
is extremely timeconsuming  The same holds for filtering of
poorquality or older materials

ZIDAR described image capture from microform using as an example three
reels from a sixtysevenreel set of the papers and letters of George
Washington Carver that had been produced by Tuskegee University  These
resulted in approximately  images which NATDP had had scanned by
its service contractor Science Applications International Corporation
SAIC  NATDP also created bibliographic records for access  NATDP did
not have such specialized equipment as a microfilm scanner

Unfortunately the process of scanning from microfilm was not an
unqualified success ZIDAR reported  because microfilm frame sizes vary
occasionally some frames were missed which without spending much time
and money could not be recaptured

OCR could not be performed from the scanned images of the frames  The
bleeding in the text simply output text when OCR was run that could not
even be edited  NATDP tested for negative versus positive images
landscape versus portrait orientation and single versus dualpage
microfilm none of which seemed to affect the quality of the image but
also on none of them could OCR be performed

In selecting the microfilm they would use therefore NATDP had other
factors in mind  ZIDAR noted two factors that influenced the quality of
the images   the inherent quality of the original and  the amount of
size reduction on the pages

The Carver papers were selected because they are informative and visually
interesting treat a single subject and are valuable in their own right
The images were scanned and divided into logical records by SAIC then
delivered and loaded onto NATDPs system where bibliographic
information taken directly from the images was added  Scanning was
completed in summer  and by the end of summer  the disk was
scheduled to be published

Problems encountered during processing included the following  Because
the microfilm scanning had to be done in a batch adjustment for
individual page variations was not possible  The frame size varied on
account of the nature of the material and therefore some of the frames
were missed while others were just partial frames  The only way to go
back and capture this material was to print out the page with the
microfilm reader from the missing frame and then scan it in from the
page which was extremely timeconsuming  The quality of the images
scanned from the printout of the microfilm compared unfavorably with that
of the original images captured directly from the microfilm  The
inability to perform OCR also was a major disappointment  At the time
computer output microfilm was unavailable to test

The equipment used for a scanning system was the last topic addressed YB
