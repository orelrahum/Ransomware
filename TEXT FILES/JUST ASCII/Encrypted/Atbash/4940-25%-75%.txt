    the CHAMORRO government has pledged to greatly reduce intervention Four
    private banks have been licensed and the government has liberalized foreign
    trade and abolished price controls on most goods Over  of the
    agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned Sandinista economic
    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis The foundation
    of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities
    largely coffee and cotton Farm production fell by roughly  in  and 
    in  and remained about even in  The agricultural sector employs
     of the work force and accounts for  of GDP and  of export
    earnings Industry which employs  of the work force and contributes
    about  to GDP showed a drop of  in  fell slightly in  ZMW
