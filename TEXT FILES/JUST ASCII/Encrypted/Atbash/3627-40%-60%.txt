POB has two features which distinguish it   scaleconversion of
 volumes into digital image form and  sourceconversion from
microfilm  Given these features several key working hypotheses guide
POB including   Since POB is using microfilm it is not concerned with
the image library as a preservation medium   Digital imagery can improve
access to recorded knowledge through printing and network distribution at
a modest incremental cost of microfilm   Capturing and storing documents
in a digital image form is necessary to further improvements in access
POB distinguishes between the imaging digitizing process and OCR
which at this stage it does not plan to perform

Currently in its first or organizational phase POB found that it could
use a vendor selection process to facilitate a good deal of the
organizational work eg creating a project team and advisory board
confirming the validity of the plan establishing the cost of the project
and a budget selecting the materials to convert and then raising the
necessary funds

POB developed numerous selection criteria including  a firm committed
to imagedocument management the ability to serve as systems integrator
in a largescale project over several years interest in developing the
requisite software as a standard rather than a custom product and a
willingness to invest substantial resources in the project itself

Two vendors DEC and Xerox were selected as finalists in October 
and with the support of the Commission on Preservation and Access each
was commissioned to generate a detailed requirements analysis for the
project and then to submit a formal proposal for the completion of the
project which included a budget and costs The terms were that POB would
pay the loser  The results for Yale of involving a vendor included
broad involvement of Yale staff across the board at a relatively low
cost which may have longterm significance in carrying out the project
twentyfive to thirty university people are engaged in POB better
understanding of the factors that affect corporate response to markets
for imaging products a competitive proposal and a more sophisticated
view of the imaging markets

The most important factor that distinguished the vendors under
consideration was their identification with the customer  The size and
internal complexity of the company also was an important factor  POB was
looking at large companies that had substantial resources  In the end
the process generated for Yale two competitive proposals with Xeroxs
the clear winner  WATERS then described the components of the proposal
the design principles and some of the costs estimated for the process

Components are essentially four  a conversion subsystem a
networkaccessible storage subsystem for  books and POB expects
 to  dpi storage browsing stations distributed on the campus
network and network access to the image printers

Among the design principles POB wanted conversion at the highest
possible resolution  Assuming TIFF files TIFF files with Group 
compression TCPIP and ethernet network on campus POB wanted a
clientserver approach with image documents distributed to the
workstations and made accessible through native workstation interfaces
such as Windows  POB also insisted on a phased approach to
implementation   a standalone singleuser lowcost entry into the
business with a workstation focused on conversion and allowing POB to
explore user access  movement into a highervolume conversion with
networkaccessible storage and multiple access stations and  a
highvolume conversion fullcapacity storage and multiple browsing
stations distributed throughout the campus

The costs proposed for startup assumed the existence of the Yale network
and its two DocuTech image printers  Other startup costs are estimated
at  million over the three phases  At the end of the project the annual
operating costs estimated primarily for the software and hardware proposed
come to about  but these exclude costs for labor needed in the
conversion process network and printer usage and facilities management

Finally the selection process produced for Yale a more sophisticated
view of the imaging markets  the management of complex documents in
image form is not a preservation problem not a library problem but a
general problem in a broad general industry  Preservation materials are
useful for developing that market because of the qualities of the
material  For example much of it is out of copyright  The resolution
of key issues such as the quality of scanning and image browsing also
will affect development of that market

The technology is readily available but changing rapidly  In this
context of rapid change several factors affect quality and cost to
which POB intends to pay particular attention for example the various
levels of resolution that can be achieved  POB believes it can bring
resolution up to  dpi but an interpolation process from  to  is
more likely  The variation quality in microfilm will prove to be a
highly important factor  POB may reexamine the standards used to film in
the first place by looking at this process as a followon to microfilming

Other important factors include  the techniques available to the
operator for handling material the ways of integrating quality control
into the digitizing work flow and a work flow that includes indexing and
storage  POBs requirement was to be able to deal with quality control
at the point of scanning  Thus thanks to Xerox POB anticipates having
a mechanism which will allow it not only to scan in batch form but to
review the material as it goes through the scanner and control quality
from the outset

The standards for measuring quality and costs depend greatly on the uses
of the material including subsequent OCR storage printing and
browsing  But especially at issue for POB is the facility for browsing
This facility WATERS said is perhaps the weakest aspect of imaging
technology and the most in need of development

A variety of factors affect the usability of complex documents in image
form among them   the ability of the system to handle the full range
of document types not just monographs but serials multipart
monographs and manuscripts  the location of the database of record
for bibliographic information about the image document which POB wants
to enter once and in the most useful place the online catalog  a
document identifier for referencing the bibliographic information in one
place and the images in another  the technique for making the basic
internal structure of the document accessible to the reader and finally
 the physical presentation on the CRT of those documents  POB is ready
to complete this phase now  One last decision involves deciding which
material to scan

                                 


DISCUSSION  TIFF files constitute de facto standard  NARAs experience
with image conversion software and text conversion  RFC  
Considerable flux concerning available hardware and software solutions 
NAL throughput rate during scanning  Window management questions 


In the questionandanswer period that followed WATERSs presentation
the following points emerged

      ZIDARs statement about using TIFF files as a standard meant de
     facto standard  This is what most people use and typically exchange
     with other groups across platforms or even occasionally across
     display software

      HOLMES commented on the unsuccessful experience of NARA in
     attempting to run imageconversion software or to exchange between
     applications  What are supposedly TIFF files go into other software
     that is supposed to be able to accept TIFF but cannot recognize the
     format and cannot deal with it and thus renders the exchange
     useless  Re text conversion he noted the different recognition
     rates obtained by substituting the make and model of scanners in
     NARAs recent test of an "intelligent" characterrecognition product
     for a new company  In the selection of hardware and software
     HOLMES argued software no longer constitutes the overriding factor
     it did until about a year ago rather it is perhaps important to
     look at both now

      Danny Cohen and Alan Katz of the University of Southern California
     Information Sciences Institute began circulating as an Internet RFC
     RFC  about a month ago a standard for a TIFF interchange
     format for Internet distribution of monochrome bitmapped images
     which LYNCH said he believed would be used as a de facto standard

      FLEISCHHAUERs impression from hearing these reports and thinking
     about AMs experience was that there is considerable flux concerning
     available hardware and software solutions  HOOTON agreed and
     commented at the same time on ZIDARs statement that the equipment
     employed affects the results produced  One cannot draw a complete
     conclusion by saying it is difficult or impossible to perform OCR
     from scanning microfilm for example with that device  that set of
     parameters and system requirements because numerous other people
     are accomplishing just that using other components perhaps
     HOOTON opined that both the hardware and the software were highly
     important  Most of the problems discussed today have been solved in
     numerous different ways by other people  Though it is good to be
     cognizant of various experiences this is not to say that it will
     always be thus

      At NAL the throughput rate of the scanning process for paper
     page by page performing OCR ranges from  to  pages per day
     not performing OCR is considerably faster although how much faster
     is not known  This is for scanning from bound books which is much
     slower

      WATERS commented on window management questions  DEC proposed an
     XWindows solution which was problematical for two reasons  One was
     POBs requirement to be able to manipulate images on the workstation
     and bring them down to the workstation itself and the other was
     network usage

                                 


THOMA  Illustration of deficiencies in scanning and storage process 
Image quality in this process  Different costs entailed by better image
quality  Techniques for overcoming various deficiencies  fixed
thresholding dynamic thresholding dithering image merge  Page edge
effects 


George THOMA chief Communications Engineering Branch National Library
of Medicine NLM illustrated several of the deficiencies discussed by
the previous speakers  He introduced the topic of special problems by
noting the advantages of electronic imaging  For example it is regenerable
because it is a coded file and realtime quality control is possible with
electronic capture whereas in photographic capture it is not

One of the difficulties discussed in the scanning and storage process was
image quality which without belaboring the obvious means different
things for maps medical Xrays or broadcast television  In the case of
documents THOMA said image quality boils down to legibility of the
textual parts and fidelity in the case of gray or color photo printtype
material  Legibility boils down to scan density the standard in most
cases being  dpi  Increasing the resolution with scanners that
perform  or  dpi however comes at a cost

Better image quality entails at least four different kinds of costs  
equipment costs because the CCD ie chargecouple device with
greater number of elements costs more   time costs that translate to
the actual capture costs because manual labor is involved the time is
also dependent on the fact that more data has to be moved around in the
machine in the scanning or network devices that perform the scanning as
well as the storage   media costs because at high resolutions larger
files have to be stored and  transmission costs because there is just
more data to be transmitted

But while resolution takes care of the issue of legibility in image
quality other deficiencies have to do with contrast and elements on the
page scanned or the image that needed to be removed or clarified  Thus
THOMA proceeded to illustrate various deficiencies how they are
manifested and several techniques to overcome them

Fixed thresholding was the first technique described suitable for
blackandwhite text when the contrast does not vary over the page  One
can have many different threshold levels in scanning devices  Thus
THOMA offered an example of extremely poor contrast which resulted from
the fact that the stock was a heavy red  This is the sort of image that
when microfilmed fails to provide any legibility whatsoever  Fixed
thresholding is the way to change the blacktored contrast to the
desired blacktowhite contrast

Other examples included material that had been browned or yellowed by
age  This was also a case of contrast deficiency and correction was
done by fixed thresholding  A final example boils down to the same
thing slight variability but it is not significant  Fixed thresholding
solves this problem as well  The microfilm equivalent is certainly legible
but it comes with dark areas  Though THOMA did not have a slide of the
microfilm in this case he did show the reproduced electronic image

When one has variable contrast over a page or the lighting over the page
area varies especially in the case where a bound volume has light
shining on it the image must be processed by a dynamic thresholding
scheme  One scheme dynamic averaging allows the threshold level not to
be fixed but to be recomputed for every pixel from the neighboring
characteristics  The neighbors of a pixel determine where the threshold
should be set for that pixel

THOMA showed an example of a page that had been made deficient by a
variety of techniques including a burn mark coffee stains and a yellow
marker  Application of a fixedthresholding scheme THOMA argued might
take care of several deficiencies on the page but not all of them
Performing the calculation for a dynamic threshold setting however
removes most of the deficiencies so that at least the text is legible

Another problem is representing a gray level with blackandwhite pixels
by a process known as dithering or electronic screening  But dithering
does not provide good image quality for pure blackandwhite textual
material  THOMA illustrated this point with examples Although its
suitability for photoprint is the reason for electronic screening or
dithering it cannot be used for every compound image  In the document
that was distributed by CXP THOMA noticed that the dithered image of the
IEEE test chart evinced some deterioration in the text  He presented an
extreme example of deterioration in the text in which compounded
documents had to be set right by other techniques  The technique
illustrated by the present example was an image merge in which the page
is scanned twice and the settings go from fixed threshold to the
dithering matrix the resulting images are merged to give the best
results with each technique

THOMA illustrated how ditheIRMT RH ZOHL FHVW RM MLMKSLGLTIZKSRX LI
