OCLC  Several practices the online environment shares with traditional
publishing on hard copy  Several technical and behavioral barriers to
electronic publishing  How AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of
clinical trials  Advantages of the electronic format and other features
of OJCCT  An illustrated tour of the journal 


Maria LEBRON managing editor The Online Journal of Current Clinical
Trials OJCCT presented an illustrated overview of the history of the
joint project between the American Association for the Advancement of
Science AAAS and the Online Computer Library Center Inc OCLC  The
joint venture between AAAS and OCLC owes its beginning to a
reorganization launched by the new chief executive officer at OCLC about
three years ago and combines the strengths of these two disparate
organizations  In short OJCCT represents the process of scholarly
publishing on line

LEBRON next discussed several practices the online environment shares
with traditional publishing on hard copyfor example peer review of
manuscriptsthat are highly important in the academic world  LEBRON
noted in particular the implications of citation counts for tenure
committees and grants committees  In the traditional hardcopy
environment citation counts are readily demonstrable whereas the
online environment represents an ethereal medium to most academics

LEBRON remarked several technical and behavioral barriers to electronic
publishing for instance the problems in transmission created by special
characters or by complex graphics and halftones  In addition she noted
economic limitations such as the storage costs of maintaining back issues
and market or audience education

Manuscripts cannot be uploaded to OJCCT LEBRON explained because it is
not a bulletin board or Email forms of electronic transmission of
information that have created an ambience clouding peoples understanding
of what the journal is attempting to do  OJCCT which publishes
peerreviewed medical articles dealing with the subject of clinical
trials includes text tabular material and graphics although at this
time it can transmit only line illustrations

Next LEBRON described how AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of
clinical trials  It is  a highly statistical discipline that  does
not require halftones but can satisfy the needs of its audience with line
illustrations and graphic material and  there is a need for the speedy
dissemination of highquality research results  Clinical trials are
research activities that involve the administration of a test treatment
to some experimental unit in order to test its usefulness before it is
made available to the general population  LEBRON proceeded to give
additional information on OJCCT concerning its editorinchief editorial
board editorial content and the types of articles it publishes
including peerreviewed research reports and reviews as well as
features shared by other traditional hardcopy journals

Among the advantages of the electronic format are faster dissemination of
information including raw data and the absence of space constraints
because pages do not exist  This latter fact creates an interesting
situation when it comes to citations  Nor are there any issues  AAASs
capacity to download materials directly from the journal to a
subscribers printer hard drive or floppy disk helps ensure highly
accurate transcription  Other features of OJCCT include onscreen alerts
that allow linkage of subsequently published documents to the original
documents online searching by subject author title etc indexing of
every single word that appears in an article viewing access to an
article by component abstract full text or graphs numbered
paragraphs to replace page counts publication in Science every thirty
days of indexing of all articles published in the journal
typesetquality screens and Hypertext links that enable subscribers to
bring up Medline abstracts directly without leaving the journal

After detailing the two primary ways to gain access to the journal
through the OCLC network and Compuserv if one desires graphics or through
the Internet if just an ASCII file is desired LEBRON illustrated the
speedy editorial process and the coding of the document using SGML tags
after it has been accepted for publication  She also gave an illustrated
tour of the journal its searchandretrieval capabilities in particular
but also including problems associated with scanning in illustrations
and the importance of onscreen alerts to the medical profession re
retractions or corrections or more frequently editorials letters to
the editors or followup reports  She closed by inviting the audience
to join AAAS on  July when OJCCT was scheduled to go online

                                 


DISCUSSION  Additional features of OJCCT 


In the lengthy discussion that followed LEBRONs presentation these
points emerged

      The SGML text can be tailored as users wish

      All these articles have a fairly simple document definition

      Documenttype definitions DTDs were developed and given to OJCCT
     for coding

      No articles will be removed from the journal  Because there are
     no back issues there are no lost issues either  Once a subscriber
     logs onto the journal he or she has access not only to the currently
     published materials but retrospectively to everything that has been
     published in it  Thus the table of contents grows bigger  The date
     of publication serves to distinguish between currently published
     materials and older materials

      The pricing system for the journal resembles that for most medical
     journals  for   for a year plus telecommunications charges
     there are no connect time charges    for   for the
     entire year for single users though the journal can be put on a
     local area network LAN  However only one person can access the
     journal at a time  Site licenses may come in the future

      AAAS is working closely with colleagues at OCLC to display
     mathematical equations on screen

      Without compromising any steps in the editorial process the
     technology has reduced the time lag between when a manuscript is
     originally submitted and the time it is accepted the review process
     does not differ greatly from the standard sixtoeight weeks
     employed by many of the hardcopy journals  The process still
     depends on people

      As far as a preservation copy is concerned articles will be
     maintained on the computer permanently and subscribers as part of
     their subscription will receive a microfichequality archival copy
     of everything published during that year in addition reprints can
     be purchased in much the same way as in a hardcopy environment
     Hard copies are prepared but are not the primary medium for the
     dissemination of the information

      Because OJCCT is not yet on line it is difficult to know how many
     people would simply browse through the journal on the screen as
     opposed to downloading the whole thing and printing it out a mix of
     both types of users likely will result

                                 


PERSONIUS  Developments in technology over the past decade  The CLASS
Project  Advantages for technology and for the CLASS Project 
Developing a network application an underlying assumption of the project
 Details of the scanning process  Printondemand copies of books 
Future plans include development of a browsing tool 


Lynne PERSONIUS assistant director Cornell Information Technologies for
Scholarly Information Services Cornell University first commented on
the tremendous impact that developments in technology over the past ten
yearsnetworking in particularhave had on the way information is
handled and how in her own case these developments have counterbalanced
Cornells relative geographical isolation  Other significant technologies
include scanners which are much more sophisticated than they were ten years
ago mass storage and the dramatic savings that result from it in terms of
both space and money relative to twenty or thirty years ago new and
improved printing technologies which have greatly affected the distribution
of information and of course digital technologies whose applicability to
library preservation remains at issue

Given that context PERSONIUS described the College Library Access and
Storage System CLASS Project a library preservation project
primarily and what has been accomplished  Directly funded by the
Commission on Preservation and Access and by the Xerox Corporation which
has provided a significant amount of hardware the CLASS Project has been
working with a development team at Xerox to develop a software
application tailored to library preservation requirements  Within
Cornell participants in the project have been working jointly with both
library and information technologies  The focus of the project has been
on reformatting and saving books that are in brittle condition
PERSONIUS showed Workshop participants a brittle book and described how
such books were the result of developments in papermaking around the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution  The papermaking process was
changed so that a significant amount of acid was introduced into the
actual paper itself which deteriorates as it sits on library shelves

One of the advantages for technology and for the CLASS Project is that
the information in brittle books is mostly out of copyright and thus
offers an opportunity to work with material that requires library
preservation and to create and work on an infrastructure to save the
material  Acknowledging the familiarity of those working in preservation
with this information PERSONIUS noted that several things are being
done  the primary preservation technology used today is photocopying of
brittle material  Saving the intellectual content of the material is the
main goal  With microfilm copy the intellectual content is preserved on
the assumption that in the future the image can be reformatted in any
other way that then exists

An underlying assumption of the CLASS Project from the beginning was
that it would develop a network application  Project staff scan books
at a workstation located in the library near the brittle material
An imageserver filing system is located at a distance from that
workstation and a printer is located in another building  All of the
materials digitized and stored on the imagefiling system are cataloged
in the online catalogue  In fact a record for each of these electronic
books is stored in the RLIN database so that a record exists of what is
in the digital library throughout standard catalogue procedures  In the
future researchers working from their own workstations in their offices
or their networks will have accesswherever they might bethrough a
request server being built into the new digital library  A second
assumption is that the preferred means of finding the material will be by
looking through a catalogue  PERSONIUS described the scanning process
which uses a prototype scanner being developed by Xerox and which scans a
very high resolution image at great speed  Another significant feature
because this is a preservation application is the placing of the pages
that fall apart one for one on the platen  Ordinarily a scanner could
be used with some sort of a document feeder but because of this
application that is not feasible  Further because CLASS is a
preservation application after the paper replacement is made there a
very careful quality control check is performed  An original book is
compared to the printed copy and verification is made before proceeding
that all of the image all of the information has been captured  Then
a new library book is produced  The printed images are rebound by a
commercial binder and a new book is returned to the shelf
Significantly the books returned to the library shelves are beautiful
and useful replacements on acidfree paper that should last a long time
in effect the equivalent of preservation photocopies  Thus the project
has a library of digital books  In essence CLASS is scanning and
storing books as  dotperinch bitmapped images compressed using
Group  CCITT ie the French acronym for International Consultative
Committee for Telegraph and Telephone compression  They are stored as
TIFF files on an optical filing system that is composed of a database
used for searching and locating the books and an optical jukebox that
stores  twelveinch platters  A veryhighresolution printed copy of
these books at  dots per inch is created using a Xerox DocuTech
printer to make the paper replacements on acidfree paper

PERSONIUS maintained that the CLASS Project presents an opportunity to
introduce people to books as digital images by using a paper medium
Books are returned to the shelves while people are also given the ability
to print on demandto make their own copies of books  PERSONIUS
distributed copies of an engineering journal published by engineering
students at Cornell around  as an example of what a printondemand
copy of material might be like  This very cheap copy would be available
to people to use for their own research purposes and would bridge the gap
between an electronic work and the paper that readers like to have
PERSONIUS then attempted to illustrate a very early prototype of
networked access to this digital library  Xerox Corporation has
developed a prototype of a view station that can send images across the
network to be viewed

The particular library brought down for demonstration contained two
mathematics books  CLASS is developing and will spend the next year
developing an application that allows people at workstations to browse
the books  Thus CLASS is developing a browsing tool on the assumption
that users do not want to read an entire book from a workstation but
would prefer to be able to look through and decide if they would like to
have a printed copy of it

                                 


DISCUSSION  Re retrieval software  "Digital file copyright"  Scanning
rate during production  Autosegmentation  Criteria employed in
selecting books for scanning  Compression and decompression of images 
OCR not precluded 


During the questionandanswer period that followed her presentation
PERSONIUS made these additional points

      Re retrieval software Cornell is developing a Unixbased server
     as well as clients for the server that support multiple platforms
     Macintosh IBM and Sun workstations in the hope that people from
     any of those platforms will retrieve books a further operating
     assumption is that standard interfaces will be used as much as
     possible where standards can be put in place because CLASS
     considers this retrieval software a library application and would
     like to be able to look at material not only at Cornell but at other
     institutions

      The phrase "digital file copyright by Cornell University" was
     added at the advice of Cornells legal staff with the caveat that it
     probably would not hold up in court  Cornell does not want people
     to copy its books and sell them but would like to keep them
     available for use in a library environment for library purposes

      In production the scanner can scan about  pages per hour
     capturing  dots per inch

      The Xerox software has filters to scan halftone material and avoid
     the moire patterns that occur when halftone material is scanned
     Xerox has been working on hardware and software that would enable
     the scanner itself to recognize this situation and deal with it
     appropriatelya kind of autosegmentation that would enable the
     scanner to handle halftone material as well as text on a single page

      The books subjected to the elaborate process described above were
     selected because CLASS is a preservation project with the first 
     books selected coming from Cornells mathematics collection because
     they were still being heavily used and because although they were
     in need of preservation the mathematics library and the mathematics
     faculty were uncomfortable having them microfilmed  They wanted a
     printed copy  Thus these books became a logical choice for this
     project  Other books were chosen by the projects selection committees
     for experiments with the technology as well as to meet a demand or need

      Images will be decompressed before they are sent over the line at
     this time they are compressed and sent to the image filing system
     and then sent to the printer as compressed images they are returned
     to the workstation as compressed dpi images and the workstation
     decompresses and scales them for displayan inefficient way to
     access the material though it works quite well for printing and
     other purposes

      CLASS is also decompressing on Macintosh and IBM a slow process
     right now  Eventually compression and decompression will take
     place on an image conversion server  Tradeoffs will be made based
     on future performance testing concerning where the file is
     compressed and what resolution image is sent

      OCR has not been precluded images are being stored that have been
     scanned at a high resolution which presumably would suit them well
     to an OCR process  Because the material being scanned is about 
     years old and was printed with lessthanideal technologies very
     early and preliminary tests have not produced good results  But the
     project is capturing an image that is of sufficient resolution to be
     subjected to OCR in the future  Moreover the system architecture
     and the system plan have a logical place to store an OCR image if it
     has been captured  But that is not being done now

                                 

SESSION III  DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS AND NETWORKING  OPTIONS FOR
DISSEMINATION


ZICH  Issues pertaining to CDROMs  Options for publishing in CDROM 


Robert ZICH special assistant to the associate librarian for special
projects Library of Congress and moderator of this session first noted
the blessed but somewhat awkward circumstance of having four very
distinguished people representing networks and networking or at least
leaning in that direction while lacking anyone to speak from the
strongest possible background in CDROMs  ZICH expressed the hope that
members of the audience would join the discussion  He stressed the
subtitle of this particular session "Options for Dissemination" and
concerning CDROMs the importance of determining when it would be wise
to consider dissemination in CDROM versus networks  A shopping list of
issues pertaining to CDROMs included  the grounds for selecting
commercial publishers and inhouse publication where possible versus
nonprofit or government publication  A similar list for networks
included  determining when one should consider dissemination through a
network identifying the mechanisms or entities that exist to place items
on networks identifying the pool of existing networks determining how a
producer  would choose between networks and identifying the elements of
a business arrangement in a network

Options for publishing in CDROM  an outside publisher versus
selfpublication  If an outside publisher is used it can be nonprofit
such as the Government Printing Office GPO or the National Technical
Information Service NTIS in the case of government  The pros and cons
associated with employing an outside publisher are obvious  Among the
pros there is no trouble getting accepted  One pays the bill and in
effect goes ones way  Among the cons when one pays an outside
publisher to perform the work that publisher will perform the work it is
obliged to do but perhaps without the production expertise and skill in
marketing and dissemination that some would seek  There is the body of
commercial publishers that do possess that kind of expertise in
distribution and marketing but that obviously are selective  In
selfpublication one exercises full control but then one must handle
matters such as distribution and marketing  Such are some of the options
for publishing in the case of CDROM

In the case of technical and design issues which are also important
there are many matters which many at the Workshop already knew a good
deal about  retrieval system requirements and costs what to do about
images the various capabilities and platforms the tradeoffs between
cost and performance concerns about localarea networkability
interoperability etc

                                 


LYNCH  Creating networked information is different from using networks
as an access or dissemination vehicle  Networked multimedia on a large
scale does not yet work  Typical CDROM publication model a twoedged
sword  Publishing information on a CDROM in the present world of
immature standards  Contrast between CDROM and network pricing 
Examples demonstrated earlier in the day as a set of insular information
gems  Paramount need to link databases  Layering to become increasingly
necessary  Project NEEDS and the issues of information reuse and active
versus passive use  XWindows as a way of differentiating between
network access and networked information  Barriers to the distribution
of networked multimedia information  Need for good realtime delivery
protocols  The question of presentation integrity in clientserver
computing in the academic world  Recommendations for producing multimedia


Clifford LYNCH director Library Automation University of California
opened his talk with the general observation that networked information
constituted a difficult and elusive topic because it is something just
starting to develop and not yet fully understood  LYNCH contended that
creating genuinely networked information was different from using
networks as an access or dissemination vehicle and was more sophisticated
and more subtle  He invited the members of the audience to extrapolate
from what they heard about the preceding demonstration projects to what
sort of a world of electronics informationscholarly archival
cultural etcthey wished to end up with ten or fifteen years from now
LYNCH suggested that to extrapolate directly from these projects would
produce unpleasant results

Putting the issue of CDROM in perspective before getting into
generalities on networked information LYNCH observed that those engaged
in multimedia today who wish to ship a product so to say probably do
not have much choice except to use CDROM  networked multimedia on a
large scale basically does not yet work because the technology does not
exist  For example anybody who has tried moving images around over the
Internet knows that this is an exciting touchandgo process a
fascinating and fertile area for experimentation research and
development but not something that one can become deeply enthusiastic
about committing to production systems at this time

This situation will change LYNCH said  He differentiated CDROM from
the practices that have been followed up to now in distributing data on
CDROM  For LYNCH the problem with CDROM is not its portability or its
