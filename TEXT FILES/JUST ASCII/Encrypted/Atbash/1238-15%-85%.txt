ACT II



SCENE VII	The forest


	A table set out Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and
	Lords like outlaws

DUKE SENIOR	I think he be transformd into a beast
	For I can no where find him like a man

First Lord	My lord he is but even now gone hence
	Here was he merry hearing of a song

DUKE SENIOR	If he compact of jars grow musical
	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres
	Go seek him tell him I would speak with him

	Enter JAQUES

First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach

DUKE SENIOR	Why how now monsieur what a life is this
	That your poor friends must woo your company?
	What you look merrily

JAQUES	A fool a fool I met a fool i the forest
	A motley fool a miserable world
	As I do live by food I met a fool
	Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun
	And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms
	In good set terms and yet a motley fool
	Good morrow fool quoth I No sir quoth he
	Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
	And then he drew a dial from his poke
	And looking on it with lacklustre eye
	Says very wisely It is ten oclock
	Thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
	Tis but an hour ago since it was nine
	And after one hour more twill be eleven
	And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
	And then from hour to hour we rot and rot
	And thereby hangs a tale When I did hear
	The motley fool thus moral on the time
	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
	That fools should be so deepcontemplative
	And I did laugh sans intermission
	An hour by his dial O noble fool
	A worthy fool Motleys the only wear

DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?

JAQUES	O worthy fool One that hath been a courtier
	And says if ladies be but young and fair
	They have the gift to know it and in his brain
	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
	After a voyage he hath strange places crammd
	With observation the which he vents
	In mangled forms O that I were a fool
	I am ambitious for a motley coat

DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one

JAQUES	It is my only suit
	Provided that you weed your better judgments
	Of all opinion that grows rank in them
	That I am wise I must have liberty
	Withal as large a charter as the wind
	To blow on whom I please for so fools have
	And they that are most galled with my folly
	They most must laugh And why sir must they so?
	The why is plain as way to parish church
	He that a fool doth very wisely hit
	Doth very foolishly although he smart
	Not to seem senseless of the bob if not
	The wise mans folly is anatomized
	Even by the squandering glances of the fool
	Invest me in my motley give me leave
	To speak my mind and I will through and through
	Cleanse the foul body of the infected world
	If they will patiently receive my medicine

DUKE SENIOR	Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do

JAQUES	What for a counter would I do but good?

DUKE SENIOR	Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
	For thou thyself hast been a libertine
	As sensual as the brutish sting itself
	And all the embossed sores and headed evils
	That thou with licence of free foot hast caught
	Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world

JAQUES	Why who cries out on pride
	That can therein tax any private party?
	Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
	Till that the weary very means do ebb?
	What woman in the city do I name
	When that I say the citywoman bears
	The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
	Who can come in and say that I mean her
	When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
	Or what is he of basest function
	That says his bravery is not of my cost
	Thinking that I mean him but therein suits
	His folly to the mettle of my speech?
	There then how then? what then? Let me see wherein
	My tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right
	Then he hath wrongd himself if he be free
	Why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies
	Unclaimd of any man But who comes here?

	Enter ORLANDO with his sword draDM
