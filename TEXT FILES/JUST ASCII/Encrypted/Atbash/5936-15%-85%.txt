among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and
untwist it  After a while she remembered that she still held the
pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very
carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and
growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height

  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size
that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a
few minutes and began talking to herself as usual  Come
theres half my plan done now  How puzzling all these changes
are  Im never sure what Im going to be from one minute to
another  However Ive got back to my right size  the next
thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow IS that to be
done I wonder?  As she said this she came suddenly upon an
open place with a little house in it about four feet high
Whoever lives there thought Alice itll never do to come
upon them THIS size  why I should frighten them out of their
wits  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did
not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself
down to nine inches high



                           CHAPTER VI

                         Pig and Pepper


  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house and
wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came
running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman
because he was in livery  otherwise judging by his face only
she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door
with his knuckles  It was opened by another footman in livery
with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen
Alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their
heads  She felt very curious to know what it was all about and
crept a little way out of the wood to listen

  The FishFootman began by producing from under his arm a great
letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to
the other saying in a solemn tone For the Duchess  An
invitation from the Queen to play croquet  The FrogFootman
repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the
words a little From the Queen  An invitation for the Duchess
to play croquet

  Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled
together

  Alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into
the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped
out the FishFootman was gone and the other was sitting on the
ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky

  Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked

  Theres no sort of use in knocking said the Footman and
that for two reasons  First because Im on the same side of the
door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise
inside no one could possibly hear you  And certainly there was
a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling
and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish
or kettle had been broken to pieces

  Please then said Alice how am I to get in?

  There might be some sense in your knocking the Footman went
on without attending to her if we had the door between us  For
instance if you were INSIDE you might knock and I could let
you out you know  He was looking up into the sky all the time
he was speaking and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil  But
perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so
VERY nearly at the top of his head  But at any rate he might
answer questionsHow am I to get in? she repeated aloud

  I shall sit here the Footman remarked till tomorrow

  At this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate
came skimming out straight at the Footmans head  it just
grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees
behind him

  or next day maybe the Footman continued in the same tone
exactly as if nothing had happened

  How am I to get in? asked Alice again in a louder tone

  ARE you to get in at all? said the Footman  Thats the
first question you know

  It was no doubt  only Alice did not like to be told so
Its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the
creatures argue  Its enough to drive one crazy

  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for
repeating his remark with variations  I shall sit here he
said on and off for days and days

  But what am I to do? said Alice

  Anything you like said the Footman and began whistling

  Oh theres no use in talking to him said Alice desperately
hes perfectly idiotic  And she opened the door and went in

  The door led right into a large kitchen which was full of
smoke from one end to the other  the Duchess was sitting on a
threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was
leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to
be full of soup

  Theres certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to
herself as well as she could for sneezing

  There was certainly too much of it in the air  Even the
Duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was
sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause  The
only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook
and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from
ear to ear

  Please would you tell me said Alice a little timidly for
she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to
speak first why your cat grins like that?

  Its a Cheshire cat said the Duchess and thats why
Pig

  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice
quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed
to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on
again

  I didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact I
didnt know that cats COULD grin

  They all can said the Duchess and most of em do

  I dont know of any that do Alice said very politely
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation

  You dont know much said the Duchess and thats a fact

  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of
conversation  While she was trying to fix on one the cook took
the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work
throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby
the fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans
plates and dishes  The Duchess took no notice of them even when
they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it
was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not

  Oh PLEASE mind what youre doing cried Alice jumping up
and down in an agony of terror  Oh there goes his PRECIOUS
nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very
nearly carried it off

  If everybody minded their own business the Duchess said in a
hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it
does

  Which would NOT be an advantage said Alice who felt very
glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her
knowledge  Just think of what work it would make with the day
and night  You see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn
round on its axis

  Talking of axes said the Duchess chop off her head

  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant
to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and
seemed not to be listening so she went on again  Twentyfour
hours I THINK or is it twelve?  I

  Oh dont bother ME said the Duchess I never could abide
figures  And with that she began nursing her child again
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a
violent shake at the end of every line

        Speak roughly to your little boy
          And beat him when he sneezes
        He only does it to annoy
          Because he knows it teases

                    CHORUS

    In which the cook and the baby joined

                Wow wow wow

  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept
tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing
howled so that Alice could hardly hear the words

        I speak severely to my boy
          I beat him when he sneezes
        For he can thoroughly enjoy
          The pepper when he pleases

                    CHORUS

                Wow wow wow

  Here you may nurse it a bit if you like the Duchess said
to Alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke  I must go and
get ready to play croquet with the Queen and she hurried out of
the room  The cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out
but it just missed her

  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer
shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all
directions just like a starfish thought Alice  The poor
little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again
so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much
as she could do to hold it

  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it
which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep
tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its
undoing itself she carried it out into the open air  IF I
dont take this child away with me thought Alice theyre sure
to kill it in a day or two  wouldnt it be murder to leave it
behind?  She said the last words out loud and the little thing
grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time  Dont
grunt said Alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself

  The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into
its face to see what was the matter with it  There could be no
doubt that it had a VERY turnup nose much more like a snout
than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for
a baby  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at
all  But perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked
into its eyes again to see if there were any tears

  No there were no tears  If youre going to turn into a pig
my dear said Alice seriously Ill have nothing more to do
with you  Mind now  The poor little thing sobbed again or
grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for
some while in silence

  Alice was just beginning to think to herself Now what am I
to do with this creature when I get it home? when it grunted
again so violently that she looked down into its face in some
alarm  This time there could be NO mistake about it  it was
neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be
quite absurd for her to carry it further

  So she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to
see it trot away quietly into the wood  If it had grown up
she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child
but it makes rather a handsome pig I think  And she began
thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as
pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right
way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing
the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off

  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice  It looked good
natured she thought  still it had VERY long claws and a great
many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect

  Cheshire Puss she began rather timidly as she did not at
all know whether it would like the name  however it only
grinned a little wider  Come its pleased so far thought
Alice and she went on  Would you tell me please which way I
ought to go from here?

  That depends a good deal on where you want to get to said
the Cat

  I dont much care where said Alice

  Then it doesnt matter which way you go said the Cat

  so long as I get SOMEWHERE Alice added as an explanation

  Oh youre sure to do that said the Cat if you only walk
long enough

  Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another
question  What sort of people live about here?

  In THAT direction the Cat said waving its right paw round
lives a Hatter  and in THAT direction waving the other paw
lives a March Hare  Visit either you like  theyre both mad

  But I dont want to go among mad people Alice remarked

  Oh you cant help that said the Cat  were all mad here
Im mad  Youre mad

  How do you know Im mad? said Alice

  You must be said the Cat or you wouldnt have come here

  Alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on
And how do you know that youre mad?

  To begin with said the Cat a dogs not mad  You grant
that?

  I suppose so said Alice

  Well then the Cat went on you see a dog growls when its
angry and wags its tail when its pleased  Now I growl when Im
pleased and wag my tail when Im angry  Therefore Im mad

  I call it purring not growling said Alice

  Call it what you like said the Cat  Do you play croquet
with the Queen today?

  I should like it very much said Alice but I havent been
invited yet

  Youll see me there said the Cat and vanished

  Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used
to queer things happening  While she was looking at the place
where it had been it suddenly appeared again

  Bythebye what became of the baby? said the Cat  Id
nearly forgotten to ask

  It turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it had
come back in a natural way

  I thought it would said the Cat and vanished again

  Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it
did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the
direction in which the March Hare was said to live  Ive seen
hatters before she said to herself the March Hare will be
much the most interesting and perhaps as this is May it wont be
raving madat least not so mad as it was in March  As she said
this she looked up and there was the Cat again sitting on a
branch of a tree

  Did you say pig or fig? said the Cat

  I said pig replied Alice and I wish you wouldnt keep
appearing and vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy

  All right said the Cat and this time it vanished quite
slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the
grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone

  Well  Ive often seen a cat without a grin thought Alice
but a grin without a cat  Its the most curious thing I ever
say in my life

  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the
house of the March Hare  she thought it must be the right house
because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was
thatched with fur  It was so large a house that she did not
like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand
bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high  even
then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself
Suppose it should be raving mad after all  I almost wish Id
gone to see the Hatter instead



                           CHAPTER VII

                         A Mad TeaParty


  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house
and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it  a
Dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two
were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and the
talking over its head  Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse
thought Alice only as its asleep I suppose it doesnt mind

  The table was a large one but the three were all crowded
together at one corner of it  No room  No room they cried
out when they saw Alice coming  Theres PLENTY of room said
Alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one
end of the table

  Have some wine the March Hare said in an encouraging tone

  Alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it
but tea  I dont see any wine she remarked

  There isnt any said the March Hare

  Then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said Alice
angrily

  It wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being
invited said the March Hare

  I didnt know it was YOUR table said Alice its laid for a
great many more than three

  Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter  He had been
looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity and this was
his first speech

  You should learn not to make personal remarks Alice said
with some severity its very rude

  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all
he SAID was Why is a raven like a writingdesk?

  Come we shall have some fun now thought Alice  Im glad
theyve begun asking riddlesI believe I can guess that she
added aloud

  Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?
said the March Hare

  Exactly so said Alice

  Then you should say what you mean the March Hare went on

  I do Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what
I saythats the same thing you know

  Not the same thing a bit said the Hatter  You might just
as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat
what I see"

  You might just as well say added the March Hare that "I
like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"

  You might just as well say added the Dormouse who seemed to
be talking in his sleep that "I breathe when I sleep" is the
same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"

  It IS the same thing with you said the Hatter and here the
conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute
while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writingdesks which wasnt much

  The Hatter was the first to break the silence  What day of
the month is it? he said turning to Alice  he had taken his
watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking
it every now and then and holding it to his ear

  Alice considered a little and then said The fourth

  Two days wrong sighed the Hatter  I told you butter
wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the March
Hare

  It was the BEST butter the March Hare meekly replied

  Yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the Hatter
grumbled  you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife

  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then
he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again  but he
could think of nothing better to say than his first remark It
was the BEST butter you know

  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity
What a funny watch she remarked  It tells the day of the
month and doesnt tell what oclock it is

  Why should it? muttered the Hatter  Does YOUR watch tell
you what year it is?

  Of course not Alice replied very readily  but thats
because it stays the same year for such a long time together

  Which is just the case with MINE said the Hatter

  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled  The Hatters remark seemed to
have no sort of meaning in it and yet it was certainly English
I dont quite understand you she said as politely as she
could

  The Dormouse is asleep again said the Hatter and he poured
a little hot tea upon its nose

  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently and said without
opening its eyes Of course of course just what I was going to
remark myself

  Have you guessed the riddle yet? the Hatter said turning to
Alice again

  No I give it up Alice replied  whats the answer?

  I havent the slightest idea said the Hatter

  Nor I said the March Hare

  Alice sighed wearily  I think you might do something better
with the time she said than waste it in asking riddles that
have no answers

  If you knew Time as well as I do said the Hatter you
wouldnt talk about wasting IT  Its HIM

  I dont know what you mean said Alice

  Of course you dont the Hatter said tossing his head
contemptuously  I dare say you never even spoke to Time

  Perhaps not Alice cautiously replied  but I know I have to
beat time when I learn music

  Ah that accounts for it said the Hatter  He wont stand
beating  Now if you only kept on good terms with him hed do
almost anything you liked with the clock  For instance suppose
it were nine oclock in the morning just time to begin lessons
youd only have to whisper a hint to Time and round goes the
clock in a twinkling  Halfpast one time for dinner

  I only wish it was the March Hare said to itself in a
whisper

  That would be grand certainly said Alice thoughtfully
but thenI shouldnt be hungry for it you know

  Not at first perhaps said the Hatter  but you could keep
it to halfpast one as long as you liked

  Is that the way YOU manage? Alice asked

  The Hatter shook his head mournfully  Not I he replied
We quarrelled last Marchjust before HE went mad you know
pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare it was at the
great concert given by the Queen of Hearts and I had to sing

            "Twinkle twinkle little bat
            How I wonder what youre at"

You know the song perhaps?

  Ive heard something like it said Alice

  It goes on you know the Hatter continued in this way

            "Up above the world you fly
            Like a teatray in the sky
                    Twinkle twinkle"

Here the Dormouse shook itself and began singing in its sleep
Twinkle twinkle twinkle twinkle and went on so long that
they had to pinch it to make it stop

  Well Id hardly finished the first verse said the Hatter
when the Queen jumped up and bawled out "Hes murdering the
time  Off with his head"

  How dreadfully savage exclaimed Alice

  And ever since that the Hatter went on in a mournful tone
he wont do a thing I ask  Its always six oclock now

  A bright idea came into Alices head  Is that the reason so
many teathings are put out here? she asked

  Yes thats it said the Hatter with a sigh  its always
teatime and weve no time to wash the things between whiles

  Then you keep moERMT ILFMW R HFKKLHV? HZRW ZORXV
