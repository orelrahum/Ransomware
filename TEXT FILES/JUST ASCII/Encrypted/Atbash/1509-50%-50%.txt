	well cut he would answer I spake not true this
	is called the Reproof Valiant If again it was not
	well cut he would say I lied this is called the
	Countercheque Quarrelsome and so to the Lie
	Circumstantial and the Lie Direct

JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial
	nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct and so we
	measured swords and parted

JAQUES	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?

TOUCHSTONE	O sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have
	books for good manners I will name you the degrees
	The first the Retort Courteous the second the
	Quip Modest the third the Reply Churlish the
	fourth the Reproof Valiant the fifth the
	Countercheque Quarrelsome the sixth the Lie with
	Circumstance the seventh the Lie Direct All
	these you may avoid but the Lie Direct and you may
	avoid that too with an If I knew when seven
	justices could not take up a quarrel but when the
	parties were met themselves one of them thought but
	of an If as If you said so then I said so and
	they shook hands and swore brothers Your If is the
	only peacemaker much virtue in If

JAQUES	Is not this a rare fellow my lord? hes as good at
	any thing and yet a fool

DUKE SENIOR	He uses his folly like a stalkinghorse and under
	the presentation of that he shoots his wit

	When earthly things made even
	Atone together
