Or come I less conspicuous or what change
Absents thee or what chance detains?Come forth
He came and with him Eve more loth though first
To offend discountenanced both and discomposed
Love was not in their looks either to God
Or to each other but apparent guilt
And shame and perturbation and despair
Anger and obstinacy and hate and guile
Whence Adam faltering long thus answered brief
I heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
Afraid being naked hid myself  To whom
The gracious Judge without revile replied
My voice thou oft hast heard and hast not feared
But still rejoiced how is it now become
So dreadful to thee?  That thou art naked who
Hath told thee?  Hast thou eaten of the tree
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?
To whom thus Adam sore beset replied
O Heaven in evil strait this day I stand
Before my Judge either to undergo
Myself the total crime or to accuse
My other self the partner of my life
Whose failing while her faith to me remains
I should conceal and not expose to blame
By my complaint but strict necessity
Subdues me and calamitous constraint
Lest on my head both sin and punishment
However insupportable be all
Devolved though should I hold my peace yet thou
Wouldst easily detect what I conceal
This Woman whom thou madest to be my help
And gavest me as thy perfect gift so good
So fit so acceptable so divine
That from her hand I could suspect no ill
And what she did whatever in itself
Her doing seemed to justify the deed
She gave me of the tree and I did eat
To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied
Was she thy God that her thou didst obey
Before his voice? or was she made thy guide
Superiour or but equal that to her
Thou didst resign thy manhood and the place
Wherein God set thee above her made of thee
And for thee whose perfection far excelled
Hers in all real dignity?  Adorned
She was indeed and lovely to attract
Thy love not thy subjection and her gifts
Were such as under government well seemed
Unseemly to bear rule which was thy part
And person hadst thou known thyself aright
So having said he thus to Eve in few
Say Woman what is this which thou hast done?
To whom sad Eve with shame nigh overwhelmed
Confessing soon yet not before her Judge
Bold or loquacious thus abashed replied
The Serpent me beguiled and I did eat
Which when the Lord God heard without delay
To judgement he proceeded on the accused
Serpent though brute unable to transfer
The guilt on him who made him instrument
Of mischief and polluted from the end
Of his creation justly then accursed
As vitiated in nature  More to know
Concerned not Man since he no further knew
Nor altered his offence yet God at last
To Satan first in sin his doom applied
Though in mysterious terms judged as then best
And on the Serpent thus his curse let fall
Because thou hast done this thou art accursed
Above all cattle each beast of the field
Upon thy belly groveling thou shalt go
And dust shalt eat all the days of thy life
Between thee and the woman I will put
Enmity and between thine and her seed
Her seed shall bruise thy head thou bruise his heel
So spake this oracle then verified
When Jesus Son of Mary second Eve
Saw Satan fall like lightning down from Heaven
Prince of the air then rising from his grave
Spoiled Principalities and Powers triumphed
In open show and with ascension bright
Captivity led captive through the air
The realm itself of Satan long usurped
Whom he shall tread at last under our feet
Even he who now foretold his fatal bruise
And to the Woman thus his sentence turned
Thy sorrow I will greatly multiply
By thy conception children thou shalt bring
In sorrow forth and to thy husbands will
Thine shall submit he over thee shall rule
On Adam last thus judgement he pronounced
Because thou hast hearkened to the voice of thy wife
And eaten of the tree concerning which
I charged thee saying Thou shalt not eat thereof
Cursed is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow
Shalt eat thereof all the days of thy life
Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
Unbid and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
Till thou return unto the ground for thou
Out of the ground wast taken know thy birth
For dust thou art and shalt to dust return
So judged he Man both Judge and Saviour sent
And the instant stroke of death denounced that day
Removed far off then pitying how they stood
Before him naked to the air that now
Must suffer change disdained not to begin
Thenceforth the form of servant to assume
As when he washed his servants feet so now
As father of his family he clad
Their nakedness with skins of beasts or slain
Or as the snake with youthful coat repaid
And thought not much to clothe his enemies
Nor he their outward only with the skins
Of beasts but inward nakedness much more
Opprobrious with his robe of righteousness
Arraying covered from his Fathers sight
To him with swift ascent he up returned
Into his blissful bosom reassumed
In glory as of old to him appeased
All though allknowing what had passed with Man
Recounted mixing intercession sweet
Mean while ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth
Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death
In counterview within the gates that now
Stood open wide belching outrageous flame
Far into Chaos since the Fiend passed through
Sin opening who thus now to Death began
O Son why sit we here each other viewing
Idly while Satan our great author thrives
In other worlds and happier seat provides
For us his offspring dear?  It cannot be
But that success attends him if mishap
Ere this he had returned with fury driven
By his avengers since no place like this
Can fit his punishment or their revenge
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise
Wings growing and dominion given me large
Beyond this deep whatever draws me on
Or sympathy or some connatural force
Powerful at greatest distance to unite
With secret amity things of like kind
By secretest conveyance  Thou my shade
Inseparable must with me along
For Death from Sin no power can separate
But lest the difficulty of passing back
Stay his return perhaps over this gulf
Impassable impervious let us try
Adventurous work yet to thy power and mine
Not unagreeable to found a path
Over this main from Hell to that new world
Where Satan now prevails a monument
Of merit high to all the infernal host
Easing their passage hence for intercourse
Or transmigration as their lot shall lead
Nor can I miss the way so strongly drawn
