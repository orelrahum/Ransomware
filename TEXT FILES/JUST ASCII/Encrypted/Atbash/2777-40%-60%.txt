Book IV


O for that warning voice which he who saw
The Apocalypse heard cry in Heaven aloud
Then when the Dragon put to second rout
Came furious down to be revenged on men
Woe to the inhabitants on earth that now
While time was our first parents had been warned
The coming of their secret foe and scaped
Haply so scaped his mortal snare  For now
Satan now first inflamed with rage came down
The tempter ere the accuser of mankind
To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss
Of that first battle and his flight to Hell
Yet not rejoicing in his speed though bold
Far off and fearless nor with cause to boast
Begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth
Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast
And like a devilish engine back recoils
Upon himself horrour and doubt distract
His troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir
The Hell within him for within him Hell
He brings and round about him nor from Hell
One step no more than from himself can fly
By change of place  Now conscience wakes despair
That slumbered wakes the bitter memory
Of what he was what is and what must be
Worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue
Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view
Lay pleasant his grieved look he fixes sad
Sometimes towards Heaven and the fullblazing sun
Which now sat high in his meridian tower
Then much revolving thus in sighs began
O thou that with surpassing glory crowned
Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God
Of this new world at whose sight all the stars
Hide their diminished heads to thee I call
But with no friendly voice and add thy name
Of Sun to tell thee how I hate thy beams
That bring to my remembrance from what state
I fell how glorious once above thy sphere
Till pride and worse ambition threw me down
Warring in Heaven against Heavens matchless King
Ah wherefore he deserved no such return
From me whom he created what I was
In that bright eminence and with his good
Upbraided none nor was his service hard
What could be less than to afford him praise
The easiest recompence and pay him thanks
How due yet all his good proved ill in me
And wrought but malice lifted up so high
I sdeined subjection and thought one step higher
Would set me highest and in a moment quit
The debt immense of endless gratitude
So burdensome still paying still to owe
Forgetful what from him I still received
And understood not that a grateful mind
By owing owes not but still pays at once
Indebted and discharged what burden then
O had his powerful destiny ordained
Me some inferiour Angel I had stood
Then happy no unbounded hope had raised
Ambition  Yet why not some other Power
As great might have aspired and me though mean
Drawn to his part but other Powers as great
Fell not but stand unshaken from within
Or from without to all temptations armed
Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?
Thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse
But Heavens free love dealt equally to all?
Be then his love accursed since love or hate
To me alike it deals eternal woe
Nay cursed be thou since against his thy will
Chose freely what it now so justly rues
Me miserable which way shall I fly
Infinite wrath and infinite despair?
Which way I fly is Hell myself am Hell
And in the lowest deep a lower deep
Still threatening to devour me opens wide
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven
O then at last relent  Is there no place
Left for repentance none for pardon left?
None left but by submission and that word
Disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
Among the Spirits beneath whom I seduced
With other promises and other vaunts
Than to submit boasting I could subdue
The Omnipotent  Ay me they little know
How dearly I abide that boast so vain
Under what torments inwardly I groan
While they adore me on the throne of Hell
With diadem and scepter high advanced
The lower still I fall only supreme
In misery  Such joy ambition finds
But say I could repent and could obtain
By act of grace my former state how soon
Would highth recall high thoughts how soon unsay
What feigned submission swore?  Ease would recant
Vows made in pain as violent and void
For never can true reconcilement grow
Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
And heavier fall  so should I purchase dear
Short intermission bought with double smart
This knows my Punisher therefore as far
From granting he as I from begging peace
All hope excluded thus behold in stead
Mankind created and for him this world
So farewell hope and with hope farewell fear
Farewell remorse all good to me is lost
Evil be thou my good by thee at least
Divided empire with Heavens King I hold
By thee and more than half perhaps will reign
As Man ere long and this new world shall know
Thus while he spake each passion dimmed his face
Thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair
Which marred his borrowed visage and betrayed
Him counterfeit if any eye beheld
For heavenly minds from such distempers foul
Are ever clear  Whereof he soon aware
Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm
Artificer of fraud and was the first
That practised falsehood under saintly show
Deep malice to conceal couched with revenge
Yet not enough had practised to deceive
Uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down
 The way he went and on the Assyrian mount
 Saw him disfigured more than could befall
 Spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce
 He marked and mad demeanour then alone
 As he supposed all unobserved unseen
 So on he fares and to the border comes
 Of Eden where delicious Paradise
 Now nearer crowns with her enclosure green
 As with a rural mound the champaign head
 Of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides
Access denied and overhead upgrew
 Insuperable height of loftiest shade
 Cedar and pine and fir and branching palm
 A sylvan scene and as the ranks ascend
 Shade above shade a woody theatre
 Of stateliest view Yet higher than their tops
 The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung

    
Which to our general sire gave prospect large
Into his nether empire neighbouring round
And higher than that wall a circling row
Of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit
Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue
Appeared with gay enamelled colours mixed
On which the sun more glad impressed his beams
Than in fair evening cloud or humid bow
When God hath showered the earth so lovely seemed
That landskip  And of pure now purer air
Meets his approach and to the heart inspires
Vernal delight and joy able to drive
All sadness but despair  Now gentle gales
Fanning their odoriferous wings dispense
Native perfumes and whisper whence they stole
Those balmy spoils  As when to them who fail
Beyond the Cape of Hope and now are past
Mozambick off at sea northeast winds blow
Sabean odours from the spicy shore
Of Araby the blest with such delay
Well pleased they slack their course and many a league
Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles
So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend
Who came their bane though with them better pleased
Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume
That drove him though enamoured from the spouse
Of Tobits son and with a vengeance sent
From Media post to Egypt there fast bound
Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill
Satan had journeyed on pensive and slow
But further way found none so thick entwined
As one continued brake the undergrowth
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed
All path of man or beast that passed that way
One gate there only was and that looked east
On the other side which when the archfelon saw
Due entrance he disdained and in contempt
At one flight bound high overleaped all bound
Of hill or highest wall and sheer within
Lights on his feet  As when a prowling wolf
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey
Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve
In hurdled cotes amid the field secure
Leaps oer the fence with ease into the fold
Or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash
Of some rich burgher whose substantial doors
Crossbarred and bolted fast fear no assault
In at the window climbs or oer the tiles
So clomb this first grand thief into Gods fold
So since into his church lewd hirelings climb
Thence up he flew and on the tree of life
The middle tree and highest there that grew
Sat like a cormorant yet not true life
Thereby regained but sat devising WVZGS
