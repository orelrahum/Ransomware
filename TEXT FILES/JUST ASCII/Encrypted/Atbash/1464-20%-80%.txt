Niger Economy

Overview
    About  of the population is engaged in farming and stock raising
    activities that generate almost half the national income The economy also
    depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits Uranium
    production grew rapidly in the mids but tapered off in the early s
    when world prices declined France is a major customer while Germany
    Japan and Spain also make regular purchases The depressed demand for
    uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy a severe
    trade imbalance and a mounting external debt

Nigeria Economy

Overview
    Although Nigeria is Africas leading oilproducing country it remains poor
    with a  per capita GDP In  massive government spending much of it
    to help ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule ballooned the budget
    deficit and caused inflation and interest rates to rise The lack of fiscal
    discipline forced the IMF to declare Nigeria not in compliance with an
    month standby facility started in January  Lagos has set ambitious
    targets for expanding oil production capacity and is offering foreign
    companies more attractive investment incentives Government efforts to
    reduce Nigerias dependence on oil exports and to sustain noninflationary
    growth however have fallen short because of inadequate new investment
    funds and endemic corruption Living standards continue to deteriorate from
    the higher level of the early s oil boom
