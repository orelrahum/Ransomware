Stood whispering soft by a fresh fountain side
They sat them down and after no more toil
Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed
To recommend cool Zephyr and made ease
More easy wholesome thirst and appetite
More grateful to their supperfruits they fell
Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
Yielded them sidelong as they sat recline
On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers
The savoury pulp they chew and in the rind
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream
Nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles
Wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems
Fair couple linked in happy nuptial league
Alone as they  About them frisking played
All beasts of the earth since wild and of all chase
In wood or wilderness forest or den
Sporting the lion ramped and in his paw
Dandled the kid bears tigers ounces pards
Gambolled before them the unwieldy elephant
To make them mirth used all his might and wreathed
His?kithetmroboscis close the serpent sly
Insinuating wove with Gordian twine
His braided train and of his fatal guile
Gave proof unheeded others on the grass
Couched and now filled with pasture gazing sat
Or bedward ruminating for the sun
Declined was hasting now with prone career
To the ocean isles and in the ascending scale
Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose
When Satan still in gaze as first he stood
Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad
O Hell what do mine eyes with grief behold
Into our room of bliss thus high advanced
Creatures of other mould earthborn perhaps
Not Spirits yet to heavenly Spirits bright
Little inferiour whom my thoughts pursue
With wonder and could love so lively shines
In them divine resemblance and such grace
The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured
Ah gentle pair ye little think how nigh
Your change approaches when all these delights
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe
More woe the more your taste is now of joy
Happy but for so happy ill secured
Long to continue and this high seat your Heaven
Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe
As now is entered yet no purposed foe
To you whom I could pity thus forlorn
Though I unpitied  League with you I seek
And mutual amity so strait so close
That I with you must dwell or you with me
Henceforth my dwelling haply may not please
Like this fair Paradise your sense yet such
Accept your Makers work he gave it me
Which I as freely give  Hell shall unfold
To entertain you two her widest gates
And send forth all her kings there will be room
Not like these narrow limits to receive
Your numerous offspring if no better place
Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge
On you who wrong me not for him who wronged
And should I at your harmless innocence
Melt as I do yet publick reason just
Honour and empire with revenge enlarged
By conquering this new world compels me now
To do what else though damned I should abhor
So spake the Fiend and with necessity
The tyrants plea excused his devilish deeds
Then from his lofty stand on that high tree
Down he alights among the sportful herd
Of those fourfooted kinds himself now one
Now other as their shape served best his end
Nearer to view his prey and unespied
To mark what of their state he more might learn
By word or action marked About them round
A lion now he stalks with fiery glare
Then as a tiger who by chance hath spied
In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play
Straight couches close then rising changes oft
His couchant watch as one who chose his ground
Whence rushing he might surest seize them both
Griped in each paw when Adam first of men
To first of women Eve thus moving speech
Turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow
Sole partner and sole part of all these joys
Dearer thyself than all needs must the Power
That made us and for us this ample world
Be infinitely good and of his good
As liberal and free as infinite
That raised us from the dust and placed us here
In all this happiness who at his hand
Have nothing merited nor can perform
Aught whereof he hath need he DSL IVJFRIVH
