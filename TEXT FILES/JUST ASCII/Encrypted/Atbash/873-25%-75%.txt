    generates about onequarter of GDP and the growing services sector has
    become crucial to the economy After expanding at a rapid  pace during
    the period  the economy slowed down in  with growth of  in
     and  in  growth in  is expected to be about  The
    economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the
