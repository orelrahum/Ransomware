In outward also her resembling less
His image who made both and less expressing
The character of that dominion given
Oer other creatures  Yet when I approach
Her loveliness so absolute she seems
And in herself complete so well to know
Her own that what she wills to do or say
Seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best
All higher knowledge in her presence falls
Degraded  Wisdom in discourse with her
Loses discountenanced and like Folly shows
Authority and Reason on her wait
As one intended first not after made
Occasionally and to consummate all
Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat
Build in her loveliest and create an awe
About her as a guard angelick placed
To whom the Angel with contracted brow
Accuse not Nature she hath done her part
Do thou but thine and be not diffident
Of Wisdom she deserts thee not if thou
Dismiss not her when most thou needest her nigh
By attributing overmuch to things
Less excellent as thou thyself perceivest
For what admirest thou what transports thee so
An outside? fair no doubt and worthy well
Thy cherishing thy honouring and thy love
Not thy subjection  Weigh with her thyself
Then value  Ofttimes nothing profits more
Than selfesteem grounded on just and right
Well managed of that skill the more thou knowest
The more she will acknowledge thee her head
And to realities yield all her shows
Made so adorn for thy delight the more
So awful that with honour thou mayest love
Thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind
Is propagated seem such dear delight
Beyond all other think the same vouchsafed
To cattle and each beast which would not be
To them made common and divulged if aught
Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue
The soul of man or passion in him move
What higher in her society thou findest
Attractive human rational love still
In loving thou dost well in passion not
Wherein true love consists not  Love refines
The thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat
In reason and is judicious is the scale
By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend
Not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause
Among the beasts no mate for thee was found
To whom thus half abashed Adam replied
Neither her outside formed so fair nor aught
In procreation common to all kinds
Though higher of the genial bed by far
And with mysterious reverence I deem
So much delights me as those graceful acts
Those thousand decencies that daily flow
From all her words and actions mixed with love
And sweet compliance which declare unfeigned
Union of mind or in us both one soul
Harmony to behold in wedded pair
More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear
Yet these subject not I to thee disclose
What inward thence I feel not therefore foiled
Who meet with various objects from the sense
Variously representing yet still free
Approve the best and follow what I approve
To love thou blamest me not for Love thou sayest
Leads up to Heaven is both the way and guide
Bear with me then if lawful what I ask
Love not the heavenly Spirits and how their love
Express they? by looks only? or do they mix
Irradiance virtual or immediate touch?
To whom the Angel with a smile that glowed
Celestial rosy red Loves proper hue
Answered  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest
Us happy and without love no happiness
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest
And pure thou wert created we enjoy
In eminence and obstacle find none
Of membrane joint or limb exclusive bars
Easier than air with air if Spirits embrace
Total they mix union of pure with pure
Desiring nor restrained conveyance need
As flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul
But I can now no more the parting sun
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles
Hesperian sets my signal to depart
Be strong live happy and love  But first of all
Him whom to love is to obey and keep
His great command take heed lest passion sway
Thy judgement to do aught which else free will
Would not admit thine and of all thy sons
The weal or woe in thee is placed beware
I in thy persevering shall rejoice
And all the Blest  Stand fastto stand or fall
Free in thine own arbitrement it lies
Perfect within no outward aid require
And all temptation to transgress repel
So saying he arose whom Adam thus
Followed with benediction  Since to part
Go heavenly guest ethereal Messenger
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore
Gentle to me and affable hath been
Thy condescension and shall be honoured ever
With grateful memory  Thou to mankind
Be good and friendly still and oft return
So parted they the Angel up to Heaven
From the thick shade and Adam to his bower



Book IX


No more of talk where God or Angel guest
With Man as with his friend familiar usd
To sit indulgent and with him partake
Rural repast permitting him the while
Venial discourse unblamd I now must change
Those notes to tragick foul distrust and breach
Disloyal on the part of Man revolt
And disobedience on the part of Heaven
Now alienated distance and distaste
Anger and just rebuke and judgement given
That brought into this world a world of woe
Sin and her shadow Death and Misery
Deaths harbinger Sad talkyet argument
Not less but more heroick than the wrath
Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued
Thrice fugitive about Troy wall or rage
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespousd
Or Neptunes ire or Junos that so long
Perplexed the Greek and Cythereas son

   
If answerable style I can obtain
Of my celestial patroness who deigns
Her nightly visitation unimplord
And dictates to me slumbering or inspires
Easy my unpremeditated verse
Since first this subject for heroick song
Pleasd me long choosing and beginning late
Not sedulous by nature to indite
Wars hitherto the only argument
Heroick deemd chief mastery to dissect
With long and tedious havock fabled knights
In battles feignd the better fortitude
Of patience and heroick martyrdom
Unsung or to describe races and games
Or tilting furniture imblazond shields
Impresses quaint caparisons and steeds
Bases and tinsel trappings gorgeous knights
At joust and tournament then marshalld feast
Servd up in hall with sewers and seneshals
The skill of artifice or office mean
Not that which justly gives heroick name
To person or to poem  Me of these
Nor skilld nor studious higher argument
Remains sufficient of itself to raise
That name unless an age too late or cold
Climate or years damp my intended wing
Depressd and much they may if all be mine
Not hers who brings it nightly to my ear
The sun was sunk and after him the star
Of Hesperus whose office is to bring
Twilight upon the earth short arbiter
"twixt day and night and now from end to end
Nights hemisphere had veild the horizon round
When satan who late fled before the threats
Of Gabriel out of Eden now improvd
In meditated fraud and malice bent
On Mans destruction maugre what might hap
Of heavier on himself fearless returned
From compassing the earth cautious of day
Since Uriel regent of the sun descried
His entrance and foreworned the CheruYRN
