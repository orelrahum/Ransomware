Then value  Ofttimes nothing profits more
Than selfesteem grounded on just and right
Well managed of that skill the more thou knowest
The more she will acknowledge thee her head
And to realities yield all her shows
Made so adorn for thy delight the more
So awful that with honour thou mayest love
Thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind
Is propagated seem such dear delight
Beyond all other think the same vouchsafed
To cattle and each beast which would not be
To them made common and divulged if aught
Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue
The soul of man or passion in him move
What higher in her society thou findest
Attractive human rational love still
In loving thou dost well in passion not
Wherein true love consists not  Love refines
The thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat
In reason and is judicious is the scale
By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend
Not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause
Among the beasts no mate for thee was found
To whom thus half abashed Adam replied
Neither her outside formed so fair nor aught
In procreation common to all kinds
Though higher of the genial bed by far
And with mysterious reverence I deem
So much delights me as those graceful acts
Those thousand decencies that daily flow
From all her words and actions mixed with love
And sweet compliance which declare unfeigned
Union of mind or in us both one soul
Harmony to behold in wedded pair
More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear
Yet these subject not I to thee disclose
What inward thence I feel not therefore foiled
Who meet with various objects from the sense
Variously representing yet still free
Approve the best and follow what I approve
To love thou blamest me not for Love thou sayest
Leads up to Heaven is both the way and guide
Bear with me then if lawful what I ask
Love not the heavenly Spirits and how their love
Express they? by looks only? or do they mix
Irradiance virtual or immediate touch?
To whom the Angel with a smile that glowed
Celestial rosy red Loves proper hue
Answered  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest
Us happy and without love no happiness
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest
And pure thou wert created we enjoy
In eminence and obstacle find none
Of membrane joint or limb exclusive bars
Easier than air with air if Spirits embrace
Total they mix union of pure with pure
Desiring nor restrained conveyance need
As flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul
But I can now no more the parting sun
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles
Hesperian sets my signal to depart
Be strong live happy and love  But first of all
Him whom to love is to obey and keep
His great command take heed lest passion sway
Thy judgement to do aught which else free will
Would not admit thine and of all thy sons
The weal or woe in thee is placed beware
I in thy persevering shall rejoice
And all the Blest  Stand fastto stand or fall
Free in thine own arbitrement it lies
Perfect within no outward aid require
And all temptation to transgress repel
So saying he arose whom Adam thus
Followed with benediction  Since to part
Go heavenly guest ethereal Messenger
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore
Gentle to me and affable hath been
Thy condescension and shall be honoured ever
With grateful memory  Thou to mankind
Be good and friendly still and oft return
So parted they the Angel up to Heaven
From the thick shade and Adam to his bower



Book IX


No more of talk where God or Angel guest
With Man as with his friend familiar usd
To sit indulgent and with him partake
Rural repast permitting him the while
Venial discourse unblamd I now must change
Those notes to tragick foul distrust and breach
Disloyal on the part of Man revolt
And disobedience on the part of Heaven
Now alienated distance and distaste
Anger and just rebuke and judgement given
That brought into this world a world of woe
Sin and her shadow Death and Misery
Deaths harbinger Sad talkyet argument
Not less but more heroick than the wrath
Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued
Thrice fugitive about Troy wall or rage
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespousd
Or Neptunes ire or Junos that so long
Perplexed the Greek and Cythereas son

   
If answerable style I can obtain
Of my celestial patroness who deigns
Her nightly visitation unimplord
And dictates to me slumbering or inspires
Easy my unpremeditated verse
Since first this subject for heroick song
Pleasd me long choosing and beginning late
Not sedulous by nature to indite
Wars hitherto the only argument
Heroick deemd chief mastery to dissect
With long and tedious havock fabled knights
In battles feignd the better fortitude
Of patience and heroick martyrdom
Unsung or to describe races and games
Or tilting furniture imblazond shields
Impresses quaint caparisons and steeds
Bases and tinsel trappings gorgeous knights
At joust and tournament then marshalld feast
Servd up in hall with sewers and seneshals
The skill of artifice or office mean
Not that which justly gives heroick name
To person or to poem  Me of these
Nor skilld nor studious higher argument
Remains sufficient of itself to raise
That name unless an age too late or cold
Climate or years damp my intended wing
Depressd and much they may if all be mine
Not hers who brings it nightly to my ear
The sun was sunk and after him the star
Of Hesperus whose office is to bring
Twilight upon the earth short arbiter
"twixt day and night and now from end to end
Nights hemisphere had veild the horizon round
When satan who late fled before the threats
Of Gabriel out of Eden now improvd
In meditated fraud and malice bent
On Mans destruction maugre what might hap
Of heavier on himself fearless returned
From compassing the earth cautious of day
Since Uriel regent of the sun descried
His entrance and foreworned the Cherubim
That kept their watch thence full of anguish driven
The space of seven continued nights he rode
With darkness thrice the equinoctial line
He circled four times crossed the car of night
From pole to pole traversing each colure
On the eighth returned and on the coast averse
From entrance or Cherubick watch by stealth
Found unsuspected way  There was a place
Now not though sin not time first wrought the change
Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise
Into a gulf shot under ground till part
Rose up a fountain by the tree of life
In with the river sunk and with it rose
Satan involved in rising mist then sought
Where to lie hid sea he had searched and land
From Eden over Pontus and the pool
Maeotis up beyond the river Ob
Downward as far antarctick and in length
West from Orontes to the ocean barred
At Darien  thence to the land where flows
Ganges and Indus Thus the orb he roamed
With narrow search and with inspection deep
Considered every creature which of all
Most opportune might serve his wiles and found
The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field
Him after long debate irresolute
Of thoughts revolved his final sentence chose
Fit vessel fittest imp of fraud in whom
To enter and his dark suggestions hide
From sharpest sight for in the wily snake
Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark
As from his wit and native subtlety
Proceeding which in other beasts observed
Doubt might beget of diabolick power
Active within beyond the sense of brute
Thus he resolved but first from inward grief
His bursting passion into plaints thus poured
More justly seat worthier of Gods as built
With second thoughts reforming what was old
O Earth how like to Heaven if not preferred
For what God after better worse would build?
Terrestrial Heaven danced round by other Heavens
That shine yet bear their bright officious lamps
Light above light for thee alone as seems
In thee concentring all their precious beams
Of sacred influence  As God in Heaven
Is center yet extends to all so thou
Centring receivest from all those orbs in thee
Not in themselves all their known virtue appears
Productive in herb plant and nobler birth
Of creatures animate with gradual life
Of growth sense reason all summed up in Man
With what delight could I have walked thee round
If I could joy in aught sweet interchange
Of hill and valley rivers woods and plains
Now land now sea and shores with forest crowned
Rocks dens and caves  But I in none of these
Find place or refuge and the more I see
Pleasures about me so much more I feel
Torment within me as from the hateful siege
Of contraries all good to me becomes
Bane and in Heaven much worse would be my state
But neither here seek I no nor in Heaven
To dwell unless by mastering Heavens Supreme
Nor hope to be myself less miserable
By what I seek but others to make such
As I though thereby worse to me redound
For only in destroying I find ease
To my relentless thoughts and him destroyed
Or won to what may work his utter loss
For whom all this was made all this will soon
Follow as to him linked in weal or woe
In woe then that destruction wide may range
To me shall be the glory sole among
The infernal Powers in one day to have marred
What he Almighty HGBOVW HRC MRTSGH ZMW WZBH
