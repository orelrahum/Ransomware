     giving a debtservice ratio of more than  of hard currency earnings and
    leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments
    The postCommunist government faces major problems of renovating an aging
    industrial plant coping with worsening energy food and consumer goods
    shortages keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments
    investing in additional energy capacity the portion of electric power from
    nuclear energy reached over onethird in  and motivating workers in
    part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises Bulgarias
    new government led by Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov is strongly committed
    to economic reform The previous government even though dominated by former
    Communists had taken the first steps toward dismantling the central
    planning system bringing the economy back into balance and reducing
    inflationary pressures The program produced some encouraging early results
    including eased restrictions on foreign investment increased support from
    international financial institutions and liberalized currency trading
    Small entrepreneurs have begun to emerge and some privatization of small
    enterprises has taken place The government has passed bills to privatize
    large stateowned enterprises and reform the banking system Negotiations on
