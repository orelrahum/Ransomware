Both all things vain and all who in vain things
Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame
Or happiness in this or the other life
All who have their reward on earth the fruits
Of painful superstition and blind zeal
Nought seeking but the praise of men here find
Fit retribution empty as their deeds
All the unaccomplished works of Natures hand
Abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed
Dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain
Till final dissolution wander here
Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed
Those argent fields more likely habitants
Translated Saints or middle Spirits hold
Betwixt the angelical and human kind
Hither of illjoined sons and daughters born
First from the ancient world those giants came
With many a vain exploit though then renowned
The builders next of Babel on the plain
Of Sennaar and still with vain design
New Babels had they wherewithal would build
Others came single he who to be deemed
A God leaped fondly into Aetna flames
Empedocles and he who to enjoy
Platos Elysium leaped into the sea
Cleombrotus and many more too long
Embryos and idiots eremites and friars
White black and gray with all their trumpery
Here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek
In Golgotha him dead who lives in Heaven
And they who to be sure of Paradise
Dying put on the weeds of Dominick
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised
They pass the planets seven and pass the fixed
And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs
The trepidation talked and that first moved
And now Saint Peter at Heavens wicket seems
To wait them with his keys and now at foot
Of Heavens ascent they lift their feet when lo
A violent cross wind from either coast
Blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry
Into the devious air  Then might ye see
Cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tost
And fluttered into rags then reliques beads
Indulgences dispenses pardons bulls
The sport of winds  All these upwhirled aloft
Fly oer the backside of the world far off
Into a Limbo large and broad since called
The Paradise of Fools to few unknown
Long after now unpeopled and untrod
All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed
And long he wandered till at last a gleam
Of dawning light turned thitherward in haste
His travelled steps far distant he descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high
At top whereof but far more rich appeared
The work as of a kingly palacegate
With frontispiece of diamond and gold
Embellished thick with sparkling orient gems
The portal shone inimitable on earth
By model or by shading pencil drawn
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
Angels ascending and descending bands
Of guardians bright when he from Esau fled
To PadanAram in the field of Luz
Dreaming by night under the open sky
And waking cried  This is the gate of Heaven
Each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
There always but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
Viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed
Of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon
Who after came from earth failing arrived
Wafted by Angels or flew oer the lake
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds
The stairs were then let down whether to dare
The Fiend by easy ascent or aggravate
His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss
Direct against which opened from beneath
Just oer the blissful seat of Paradise
A passage down to the Earth a passage wide
Wider by far than that of aftertimes
Over mount Sion and though that were large
Over the Promised Land to God so dear
By which to visit oft those happy tribes
On high behests his angels to and fro
Passed frequent and his eye with choice regard
From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood
To Beersaba where the Holy Land
Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore
So wide the opening seemed where bounds were set
To darkness such as bound the ocean wave
Satan from hence now on the lower stair
That scaled by steps of gold to Heavengate
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this world at once  As when a scout
Through dark?nd desart ways with?oeril gone
All?might?t?kast by break of cheerful dawn
Obtains the brow of some highclimbing hill
Which to his eye discovers unaware
The goodly prospect of some foreign land
First seen or some renowned metropolis
With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned
Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams
Such wonder seised though after Heaven seen
The Spirit malign but much more envy seised
At sight of all this world beheld so fair
Round he surveys and well might where he stood
So high above the circling canopy
Of nights extended shade from eastern point
Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears
Andromeda far off Atlantick seas
Beyond the horizon then from pole to pole
He views in breadth and without longer pause
Down right into the worlds first region throws
His flight precipitant and winds with ease
Through the pure marble air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable stars that shone
Stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds
Or other worlds they seemed or happy isles
Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old
Fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales
Thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there
He staid not to inquire  Above them all
The golden sun in splendour likest Heaven
Allured his eye thither his course he bends
Through the calm firmament but up or down
By center or eccentrick hard to tell
Or longitude where the great luminary
Aloof the vulgar constellations thick
That from his lordly eye keep distance due
Dispenses light from far they as they move
Their starry dance in numbers that compute
Days months and years towards his allcheering lamp
Turn swift their various motions or are turned
By his magnetick beam that gently warms
The universe and to each inward part
With gentle penetration though unseen
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep
So wonderously was set his station bright
There lands the Fiend a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the suns lucent orb
Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw
The place he found beyond expression bright
Compared with aught on earth metal or stone
Not all parts like but all alike informed
With radiant light as glowing iron with fire
If metal part seemed gold part silver clear
If stone carbuncle most or chrysolite
Ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone
In Aarons breastplate and a stone besides
Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen
That stone or like to that which here below
Philosophers in vain so long have sought
In vain though by their powerful art they bind
Volatile Hermes and call up unbound
In various shapes old Proteus from the sea
Drained through a limbeck to his native form
What wonder then if fields and regions here
Breathe forth Elixir pure and rivers run
Potable gold when with one virtuous touch
The archchemick sun so far from us remote
Produces with terrestrial humour mixed
Here in the dark so many precious things
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
Undazzled far and wide his eye commands
For sight no obstacle found here nor shade
But all sunshine as when his beams at noon
Culminate from the equator as they now
Shot upward still direct whence no way round
Shadow from body opaque can fall and the air
No where so clear sharpened his visual ray
To objects distant far whereby he soon
Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand
The same whom John saw also in the sun
His back was turned but not his brightness hid
Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
Circled his head nor less his locks behind
Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
Lay waving round on some great charge employed
He seemed or fixed in cogitation deep
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope
To find who might direct his wandering flight
To Paradise the happy seat of Man
His journeys end and our beginning woe
But first he casts to change his proper shape
Which else might work him danger or delay
And now a stripling Cherub he appears
Not of the prime yet such as in his face
Youth smiled celestial and to every limb
Suitable grace diffused so well he feigned
Under a coronet his flowing hair
In curls on either cheek played wings he wore
Of many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold
His habit fit for speed succinct and held
Before his decent steps a silver wand
He drew not nigh unheard the Angel bright
Ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turned
Admonished by his ear and straight was known
The ArchAngel Uriel one of the seven
Who in Gods presence nearest to his throne
Stand ready at command and are his eyes
That run through all the Heavens or down to the Earth
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry
Oer sea and land him Satan thus accosts
Uriel for thou of those seven Spirits that stand
In sight of Gods high throne gloriously bright
The first art wont his great authentick will
Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring
Where all his sons thy embassy attend
And here art likeliest by supreme decree
Like honour to obtain and as his eye
To visit oft this new creation round
Unspeakable desire to see and know
All these his wonderous works but chiefly Man
His chief delight and favour him for whom
All these his works so wonderous he ordained
Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim
Alone thus wandering  Brightest Seraph tell
In which of all these shining orbs hath Man
His fixed seat or fixed seat hath none
But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell
That I may find him and with secret gaze
Or open admiration him behold
On whom the great Creator hath bestowed
Worlds and on whom hath all these graces poured
That both in him and all things as is meet
The universal Maker we may praise
Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
To deepest Hell and to repair that loss
Created this new happy race of Men
To serve him better  Wise are all his ways
So spake the false dissembler unperceived
For neither Man nor Angel can discern
Hypocrisy the only evil that walks
Invisible except to God alone
By his permissive will through Heaven and Earth
And oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps
At wisdoms gate and to simplicity
Resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill
Where no ill seems  Which now for once beguiled
Uriel though regent of the sun and held
The sharpestsighted Spirit of all in Heaven
Who to the fraudulent impostor foul
In his uprightness answer thus returned
Fair Angel thy desire which tends to know
The works of God thereby to glorify
The great Workmaster leads to no excess
That reaches blame but rather merits praise
The more it seems excess that led thee hither
From thy empyreal mansion thus alone
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps
Contented with report hear only in Heaven
For wonderful indeed are all his works
Pleasant to know and worthiest to be all
Had in remembrance always with delight
But what created mind can comprehend
Their number or the wisdom infinite
That brought them forth but hid their causes deep?
I saw when at his word the formless mass
This worlds material mould came to a heap
Confusion heard his voice and wild uproar
Stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined
Till at his second bidding Darkness fled
Light shone and order from disorder sprung
Swift to their several quarters hasted then
The cumbrous elements earth flood air fire
And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven
Flew upward spirited with various forms
That rolled orbicular and turned to stars
Numberless as thou seest and how they move
Each had his place appointed each his course
The rest in circuit walls this universe
Look downward on that globe whose hither side
With light from hence though but reflected shines
That place is Earth the seat of Man that light
His day which else as the other hemisphere
Night would invade but there the neighbouring moon
So call that opposite fair star her aid
Timely interposes and her monthly round
Still ending still renewing through mid Heaven
With borrowed light her countenance triform
Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth
And in her pale dominion checks the night
That spot to which I point is Paradise
Adams abode those lofty shades his bower
Thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires
Thus said he GFIMVW ZMW HZGZM YLDRMT OLD
