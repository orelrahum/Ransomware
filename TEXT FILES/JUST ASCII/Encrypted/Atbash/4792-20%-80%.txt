    Moldova the nexttosmallest of the former Soviet republics in area is the
    most densely inhabited Moldova has a little more than  of the population
    labor force capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union Living
    standards have been below average for the European USSR The country enjoys
    a favorable climate and economic development has been primarily based on
    agriculture featuring fruits vegetables wine and tobacco Industry
    accounts for  of the labor force whereas agriculture employs more than
    onethird Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on the
    former Soviet republics for coal oil gas steel most electronic
    equipment machine tools and major consumer durables such as automobiles
    Its industrial and agricultural products in turn have been exported to the
    other former Soviet republics Moldova has freed prices on most goods and
    has legalized private ownership of property including agricultural land
    Moldovas economic prospects are dimmed by the difficulties of moving toward
    a market economy and the political problems of redefining ties to the other
    former Soviet republics and Romania
