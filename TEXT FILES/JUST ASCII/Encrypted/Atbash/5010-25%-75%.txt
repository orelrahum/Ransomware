As thus he spake each bird and beast behold
Approaching two and two these cowering low
With blandishment each bird stooped on his wing
I named them as they passed and understood
Their nature with such knowledge God endued
My sudden apprehension  But in these
I found not what methought I wanted still
And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed
O by what name for thou above all these
Above mankind or aught than mankind higher
Surpassest far my naming how may I
Adore thee Author of this universe
And all this good to man? for whose well being
So amply and with hands so liberal
Thou hast provided all things  But with me
I see not who partakes  In solitude
What happiness who can enjoy alone
Or all enjoying what contentment find?
Thus I presumptuous and the Vision bright
As with a smile more brightened thus replied
What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth
With various living creatures and the air
Replenished and all these at thy command
To come and play before thee?  Knowest thou not
Their language and their ways?  They also know
And reason not contemptibly  With these
Find pastime and bear rule thy realm is large
So spake the Universal Lord and seemed
So ordering  I with leave of speech implored
And humble deprecation thus replied
Let not my words offend thee Heavenly Power
My Maker be propitious while I speak
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute
And these inferiour far beneath me set?
Among unequals what society
Can sort what harmony or true delight?
Which must be mutual in proportion due
Given and received but in disparity
The one intense the other still remiss
Cannot well suit with either but soon prove
Tedious alike  Of fellowship I speak
Such as I seek fit to participate
All rational delight wherein the brute
Cannot be human consort  They rejoice
Each with their kind lion with lioness
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined
Much less can bird with beast or fish with fowl
So well converse nor with the ox the ape
Worse then can man with beast and least of all
Whereto the Almighty answered not displeased
A nice and subtle happiness I see
Thou to thyself proposest in the choice
Of thy associates Adam and wilt taste
No pleasure though in pleasure solitary
What thinkest thou then of me and this my state?
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed
Of happiness or not? who am alone
From all eternity for none I know
Second to me or like equal much less
How have I then with whom to hold converse
Save with the creatures which I made and those
To me inferiour infinite descents
Beneath what other creatures are to thee?
He ceased I lowly answered  To attain
The highth and depth of thy eternal ways
All human thoughts come short Supreme of things
Thou in thyself art perfect and in thee
Is no deficience found  Not so is Man
But in degree the cause of his desire
By conversation with his like to help
Or solace his defects  No need that thou
Shouldst propagate already Infinite
And through all numbers absolute though One
But Man by number is to manifest
His single imperfection and beget
Like of his like his image multiplied
In unity defective which requires
Collateral love and dearest amity
Thou in thy secresy although alone
Best with thyself accompanied seekest not
Social communication yet so pleased
Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt
Of union or communion deified
I by conversing cannot these erect
From prone nor in their ways complacence find
Thus I emboldened spake and freedom used
Permissive and acceptance found which gained
This answer from the gracious Voice Divine
Thus far to try thee Adam I was pleased
And find thee knowing not of beasts alone
Which thou hast rightly named but of thyself
Expressing well the spirit within thee free
My image not imparted to the brute
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike
And be so minded still  I ere thou spakest
Knew it not good for Man to be alone
And no such company as then thou sawest
Intended thee for trial only brought
To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet
What next I bring shall please thee be assured
Thy likeness thy fit help thy other self
Thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire
He ended or I heard no more for now
My earthly by his heavenly overpowered
Which it had long stood under strained to the highth
In that celestial colloquy sublime
As with an object that excels the sense
Dazzled and spent sunk down and sought repair
Of sleep which instantly fell on me called
By Nature as in aid and closed mine eyes
Mine eyes he closed but open left the cell
Of fancy my internal sight by which
Abstract as in a trance methought I saw
Though sleeping where I lay and saw the shape
Still glorious before whom awake I stood
Who stooping opened my left side and took
From thence a rib with cordial spirits warm
And lifeblood streaming fresh wide was the wound
But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed
The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands
Under his forming hands a creature grew
Manlike but different sex so lovely fair
That what seemed fair in all the world seemed now
Mean or in her summed up in her contained
And in her looks which from that time infused
Sweetness into my heart unfelt before
And into all things from her air inspired
The spirit of love and amorous delight
She disappeared and left me dark I waked
To find her or for ever to deplore
Her loss and other pleasures all abjure
When out of hope behold her not far off
Such as I saw her in my dream adorned
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow
To make her amiable  On she came
Led by her heavenly Maker though unseen
And guided by his voice nor uninformed
Of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites
Grace was in all her steps Heaven in her eye
In every gesture dignity and love
I overjoyed could not forbear aloud
This turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilled
Thy words Creator bounteous and benign
Giver of all things fair but fairest this
Of all thy gifts nor enviest  I now see
Bone of my bone flesh of my flesh myself
Before me  Woman is her nameof Man
Extracted for this cause he shall forego
Father and mother and to his wife adhere
And they shall be one flesh one heart one soul
She heard me thus and though divinely brought
Yet innocence and virgin modesty
Her virtue and the conscience of her worth
That would be wooed and not unsought be won
Not obvious not obtrusive but retired
The more desirable or to say all
Nature herself though pure of sinful thought
Wrought in her so that seeing me she turned
I followed her she what was honour knew
And with obsequious majesty approved
My pleaded reason  To the nuptial bower
I led her blushing like the morn All Heaven
And happy constellations on that hour
Shed their selectest influence the Earth
Gave sign of gratulation and each hill
Joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs
Whispered it to the woods and from their wings
Flung rose flung odours from the spicy shrub
Disporting till the amorous bird of night
Sung spousal and bid haste the eveningstar
On his hill top to light the bridal lamp
Thus have I told thee all my state and brought
My story to the sum of earthly bliss
Which I enjoy and must confess to find
In all things else delight indeed but such
As used or not works in the mind no change
Nor vehement desire these delicacies
I mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flowers
Walks and the melody of birds but here
Far otherwise transported I behold
Transported touch here passion first I felt
Commotion strange in all enjoyments else
Superiour and unmoved here only weak
Against the charm of Beautys powerful glance
Or Nature failed in me and left some part
Not proof enough such object to sustain
Or from my side subducting took perhaps
More than enough at least on her bestowed
Too much of ornament in outward show
Elaborate of inward less exact
For well I understand in the prime end
Of Nature her the inferiour in the mind
And inward faculties which most excel
In outward also her resembling less
His image who made both and less expressing
The character of that dominion given
Oer other creatures  Yet when I approach
Her loveliness so absolute she seems
And in herself complete so well to know
Her own that what she wills to do or say
Seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best
All higher knowledge in her presence falls
Degraded  Wisdom in discourse with her
Loses discountenanced and like Folly shows
Authority and Reason on her wait
As one intended first not after made
