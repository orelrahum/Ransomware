Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
Or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed
So wise he judges it to fly from pain
However and to scape his punishment
So judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath
Which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight
Sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to Hell
Which taught thee yet no better that no pain
Can equal anger infinite provoked
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they
Less hardy to endure?  Courageous Chief
The first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged
To thy deserted host this cause of flight
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive
To which the Fiend thus answered frowning stern
Not that I less endure or shrink from pain
Insulting Angel well thou knowest I stood
Thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid
The blasting vollied thunder made all speed
And seconded thy else not dreaded spear
But still thy words at random as before
Argue thy inexperience what behoves
From hard assays and ill successes past
A faithful leader not to hazard all
Through ways of danger by himself untried
I therefore I alone first undertook
To wing the desolate abyss and spy
This new created world whereof in Hell
Fame is not silent here in hope to find
Better abode and my afflicted Powers
To settle here on earth or in mid air
Though for possession put to try once more
What thou and thy gay legions dare against
Whose easier business were to serve their Lord
High up in Heaven with songs to hymn his throne
And practised distances to cringe not fight
To whom the warriour Angel soon replied
To say and straight unsay pretending first
Wise to fly pain professing next the spy
Argues no leader but a liear traced
Satan and couldst thou faithful add?  O name
O sacred name of faithfulness profaned
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
Army of Fiends fit body to fit head
Was this your discipline and faith engaged
Your military obedience to dissolve
Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?
And thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
Patron of liberty who more than thou
Once fawned and cringed and servily adored
Heavens awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope
To dispossess him and thyself to reign?
But mark what I arreed thee now Avant
Fly neither whence thou fledst  If from this hour
Within these hallowed limits thou appear
Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained
And seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn
The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred
So threatened he but Satan to no threats
Gave heed but waxing more in rage replied
Then when I am thy captive talk of chains
Proud limitary Cherub but ere then
Far heavier load thyself expect to feel
From my prevailing arm though Heavens King
Ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers
Usd to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels
In progress through the road of Heaven starpaved
While thus he spake the angelick squadron bright
Turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns
Their phalanx and began to hem him round
With ported spears as thick as when a field
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
Her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
Sways them the careful plowman doubting stands
Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
Prove chaff  On the other side Satan alarmed
Collecting all his might dilated stood
Like Teneriff or Atlas unremoved
