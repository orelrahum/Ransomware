	Exit DENNIS

	Twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is

	Enter CHARLES

CHARLES	Good morrow to your worship

OLIVER	Good Monsieur Charles whats the new news at the
	new court?

CHARLES	Theres no news at the court sir but the old news
	that is the old duke is banished by his younger
	brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
	have put themselves into voluntary exile with him
	whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
	therefore he gives them good leave to wander

OLIVER	Can you tell if Rosalind the dukes daughter be
	banished with her father?

CHARLES	O no for the dukes daughter her cousin so loves
	her being ever from their cradles bred together
	that she would have followed her exile or have died
	to stay behind her She is at the court and no
	less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
	never two ladies loved as they do

OLIVER	Where will the old duke live?

CHARLES	They say he is already in the forest of Arden and
	a many merry men with him and there they live like
	the old Robin Hood of England they say many young
	gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time
	carelessly as they did in the golden world

OLIVER	What you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?

CHARLES	Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a
	matter I am given sir secretly to understand
	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
	to come in disguised against me to try a fall
	Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that
	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
	well Your brother is but young and tender and
	for your love I would be loath to foil him as I
	must for my own honour if he come in therefore
	out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you
	withal that either you might stay him from his
	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
	run into in that it is a thing of his own search
	and altogether against my will

OLIVER	Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which
	thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had
	myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and
	have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
	it but he is resolute Ill tell thee Charles
	it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full
	of ambition an envious emulator of every mans
	good parts a secret and villanous contriver against
	me his natural brother therefore use thy
	discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck
	as his finger And thou wert best look tot for if
	thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
	mightily grace himself on thee he will practise
	against thee by poison entrap thee by some
	treacherous device and never leave thee till he
	hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other
	for I assure thee and almost with tears I speak
	it there is not one so young and so villanous this
	day living I speak but brotherly of him but
	should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must
	blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder

CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come
	tomorrow Ill give him his payment if ever he go
	alone again Ill never wrestle for prize more and
	so God keep your worship

OLIVER	Farewell good Charles

	Exit CHARLES

	Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see
	an end of him for my soul yet I know not why
	hates nothing more than he Yet hes gentle never
	schooled and yet learned full of noble device of
	all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much
	in the heart of the world and especially of my own
	people who best know him that I am altogether
	misprised but it shall not be so long this
	wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that
	I kindle the boy thither which now Ill go about

	Exit




	AS YOU LIKE IT


ACT I



SCENE II	Lawn before the Dukes palace


	Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

CELIA	I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry

ROSALIND	Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of
	and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
	teach me to forget a banished father you must not
	learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure

CELIA	Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
	that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father
	had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou
	hadst been still with me I could have taught my
	love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou
	if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
	tempered as mine is to thee

ROSALIND	Well I will forget the condition of my estate to
	rejoice in yours

CELIA	You know my father hath no child but I nor none is
	like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt
	be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy
	father perforce I will render thee again in
	affection by mine honour I will and when I break
	that oath let me turn monster therefore my
	sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry

ROSALIND	From henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let
	me see what think you of falling in love?

CELIA	Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but
	love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport
	neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
	in honour come off again

ROSALIND	What shall be our sport then?

CELIA	Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
	her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally

ROSALIND	I would we could do so for her benefits are
	mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman
	doth most mistake in her gifts to women

CELIA	Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce
	makes honest and those that she makes honest she
	makes very illfavouredly

ROSALIND	Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to
	Natures Fortune reigns in gifts of the world
	not in the lineaments of Nature

	Enter TOUCHSTONE

CELIA	No? when Nature hath made a fair creature may she
	not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
	hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not
	Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?

ROSALIND	Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when
	Fortune makes Natures natural the cutteroff of
	Natures wit

CELIA	Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither but
	Natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
	to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
	natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of
	the fool is the whetstone of the wits How now
	wit whither wander you?

TOUCHSTONE	Mistress you must come away to your father

CELIA	Were you made the messenger?

TOUCHSTONE	No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you

ROSALIND	Where learned you that oath fool?

TOUCHSTONE	Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
	were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
	mustard was naught now Ill stand to it the
	pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and
	yet was not the knight forsworn

CELIA	How prove you that in the great heap of your
	knowledge?

ROSALIND	Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom

TOUCHSTONE	Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and
	swear by your beards that I am a knave

CELIA	By our beards if we had them thou art

TOUCHSTONE	By my knavery if I had it then I were but if you
	swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no
	more was this knight swearing by his honour for he
	never had any or if he had he had sworn it away
	before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard

CELIA	Prithee who ist that thou meanest?

TOUCHSTONE	One that old Frederick your father loves

CELIA	My fathers love is enough to honour him enough
	speak no more of him youll be whipped for taxation
	one of these days

TOUCHSTONE	The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
	wise men do foolishly

CELIA	By my troth thou sayest true for since the little
	wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery
	that wise men have makes a great show Here comes
	Monsieur Le Beau

ROSALIND	With his mouth full of news

CELIA	Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young

ROSALIND	Then shall we be newscrammed

CELIA	All the better we shall be the more marketable

	Enter LE BEAU

	Bon jour Monsieur Le Beau whats the news?

LE BEAU	Fair princess you have lost much good sport

CELIA	Sport of what colour?

LE BEAU	What colour madam how shall I answer you?

ROSALIND	As wit and fortune will

TOUCHSTONE	Or as the Destinies decree

CELIA	Well said that was laid on with a trowel

TOUCHSTONE	Nay if I PVVK MLG NB IZMP
