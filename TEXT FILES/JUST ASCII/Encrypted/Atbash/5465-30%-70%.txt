Iran Economy

Overview
    Irans economy is a mixture of central planning state ownership of oil and
    other large enterprises village agriculture and smallscale private
    trading and service ventures After a decade of economic decline Irans GNP
    grew roughly  in FY and  in FY An oil windfall in  combined
    with a substantial increase in imports contributed to Irans recent economic
    growth Iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to
    reduce government intervention including subsidies and has allocated
    substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the
    economy Nevertheless lower oil revenues in   oil accounts for more
    than  of export revenues and provides roughly  of the financing for
    the fiveyear economic development plan  and dramatic increases in external
    debt are threatening development plans and could prompt Iran to cut imports
    thus limiting economic growth in the medium term

Iraq Economy

Overview
    The Bathist regime engages in extensive central planning and management of
    industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some smallscale
    industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise The
    economy has been dominated by the oil sector which has provided about 
    of foreign exchange earnings In the s financial problems caused by
    massive expenditures in the eightyear war with Iran and damage to oil
    export facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity
    measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments
    After the end of hostilities in  oil exports gradually increased with
    the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities
    Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages salinization
    and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization
    programs The industrial sector although accorded high priority by the
    government also was under financial constraints Iraqs seizure of Kuwait
    in August  subsequent international economic embargoes and military
    actions by an international coalition beginning in January  drastically
    changed the economic picture Oil exports were cut to near zero and
    industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged Throughout
     the UNs economic embargo worked to reduce exports and imports and to
    increase prices for most goods The governments policy to allocate goods to
    key supporters of the regime exacerbated shortages
