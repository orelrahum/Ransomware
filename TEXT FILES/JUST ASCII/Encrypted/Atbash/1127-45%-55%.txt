Thou Sun of this great world both eye and soul
Acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise
In thy eternal course both when thou climbest
And when high noon hast gained and when thou fallest
Moon that now meetest the orient sun now flyest
With the fixed Stars fixed in their orb that flies
And ye five other wandering Fires that move
In mystick dance not without song resound
His praise who out of darkness called up light
Air and ye Elements the eldest birth
Of Natures womb that in quaternion run
Perpetual circle multiform and mix
And nourish all things let your ceaseless change
Vary to our great Maker still new praise
Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise
From hill or steaming lake dusky or gray
Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold
In honour to the worlds great Author rise
Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers
Rising or falling still advance his praise
His praise ye Winds that from four quarters blow
Breathe soft or loud and wave your tops ye Pines
With every plant in sign of worship wave
Fountains and ye that warble as ye flow
Melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise
Join voices all ye living Souls  Ye Birds
That singing up to Heavengate ascend
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise
Ye that in waters glide and ye that walk
The earth and stately tread or lowly creep
Witness if I be silent morn or even
To hill or valley fountain or fresh shade
Made vocal by my song and taught his praise
Hail universal Lord be bounteous still
To give us only good and if the night
Have gathered aught of evil or concealed
Disperse it as now light dispels the dark
So prayed they innocent and to their thoughts
Firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm
On to their mornings rural work they haste
Among sweet dews and flowers where any row
Of fruittrees overwoody reached too far
Their pampered boughs and needed hands to check
Fruitless embraces or they led the vine
To wed her elm she spoused about him twines
Her marriageable arms and with him brings
Her dower the adopted clusters to adorn
His barren leaves  Them thus employed beheld
With pity Heavens high King and to him called
Raphael the sociable Spirit that deigned
To travel with Tobias and secured
His marriage with the seventimeswedded maid
Raphael said he thou hearest what stir on Earth
Satan from Hell scaped through the darksome gulf
Hath raised in Paradise and how disturbed
This night the human pair how he designs
In them at once to ruin all mankind
Go therefore half this day as friend with friend
Converse with Adam in what bower or shade
Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired
To respite his daylabour with repast
Or with repose and such discourse bring on
As may advise him of his happy state
Happiness in his power left free to will
Left to his own free will his will though free
Yet mutable whence warn him to beware
He swerve not too secure  Tell him withal
His danger and from whom what enemy
Late fallen himself from Heaven is plotting now
The fall of others from like state of bliss
By violence? no for that shall be withstood
But by deceit and lies  This let him know
Lest wilfully transgressing he pretend
Surprisal unadmonished unforewarned
So spake the Eternal Father and fulfilled
All justice  Nor delayed the winged Saint
After his charge received but from among
Thousand celestial Ardours where he stood
Veiled with his gorgeous wings up springing light
Flew through the midst of Heaven the angelick quires
On each hand parting to his speed gave way
Through all the empyreal road till at the gate
Of Heaven arrived the gate selfopened wide
On golden hinges turning as by work
Divine the sovran Architect had framed
From hence no cloud or to obstruct his sight
Star interposed however small he sees
Not unconformed to other shining globes
Earth and the garden of God with cedars crowned
Above all hills  As when by night the glass
Of Galileo less assured observes
Imagined lands and regions in the moon
Or pilot from amidst the Cyclades
Delos or Samos first appearing kens
A cloudy spot  Down thither prone in flight
He speeds and through the vast ethereal sky
Sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing
Now on the polar winds then with quick fan
Winnows the buxom air till within soar
Of towering eagles to all the fowls he seems
A phoenix gazed by all as that sole bird
When to enshrine his reliques in the Suns
Bright temple to Egyptian Thebes he flies
At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise
He lights and to his proper shape returns
A Seraph winged  Six wings he wore to shade
His lineaments divine the pair that clad
Each shoulder broad came mantling oer his breast
With regal ornament the middle pair
Girt like a starry zone his waist and round
Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold
And colours dipt in Heaven the third his feet
Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail
Skytinctured grain  Like Maias son he stood
And shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled
The circuit wide  Straight knew him all the bands
Of Angels under watch and to his state
And to his message high in honour rise
For on some message high they guessed him bound
Their glittering tents he passed and now is come
Into the blissful field through groves of myrrh
And flowering odours cassia nard and balm
A wilderness of sweets for Nature here
Wantoned as in her prime and played at will
Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet
Wild above rule or art enormous bliss
Him through the spicy forest onward come
Adam discerned as in the door he sat
Of his cool bower while now the mounted sun
Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm
Earths inmost womb more warmth than Adam needs
And Eve within due at her hour prepared
For dinner savoury fruits of taste to please
True appetite and not disrelish thirst
