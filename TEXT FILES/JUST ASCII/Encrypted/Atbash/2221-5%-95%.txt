To motion measures all things durable
By present past and future on such day
As Heavens great year brings forth the empyreal host
Of Angels by imperial summons called
Innumerable before the Almightys throne
Forthwith from all the ends of Heaven appeared
Under their Hierarchs in orders bright
Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced
Standards and gonfalons twixt van and rear
Stream in the air and for distinction serve
Of hierarchies of orders and degrees
Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed
Holy memorials acts of zeal and love
Recorded eminent  Thus when in orbs
Of circuit inexpressible they stood
Orb within orb the Father Infinite
By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son
Amidst as from a flaming mount whose top
Brightness had made invisible thus spake
Hear all ye Angels progeny of light
Thrones Dominations Princedoms Virtues Powers
Hear my decree which unrevoked shall stand
This day I have begot whom I declare
My only Son and on this holy hill
Him have anointed whom ye now behold
At my right hand your head I him appoint
And by myself have sworn to him shall bow
All knees in Heaven and shall confess him Lord
Under his great vicegerent reign abide
United as one individual soul
For ever happy  Him who disobeys
Me disobeys breaks union and that day
Cast out from God and blessed vision falls
Into utter darkness deep ingulfed his place
Ordained without redemption without end
So spake the Omnipotent and with his words
All seemed well pleased all seemed but were not all
