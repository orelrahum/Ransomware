Satans assaults and quench his fiery darts
What man can do against them not afraid
Though to the death against such cruelties
With inward consolations recompensed
And oft supported so as shall amaze
Their proudest persecutors  For the Spirit
Poured first on his Apostles whom he sends
To evangelize the nations then on all
Baptized shall them with wonderous gifts endue
To speak all tongues and do all miracles
As did their Lord before them  Thus they win
Great numbers of each nation to receive
With joy the tidings brought from Heaven  At length
Their ministry performed and race well run
Their doctrine and their story written left
They die but in their room as they forewarn
Wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven
To their own vile advantages shall turn
Of lucre and ambition and the truth
With superstitions and traditions taint
Left only in those written records pure
Though not but by the Spirit understood
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names
Places and titles and with these to join
Secular power though feigning still to act
By spiritual to themselves appropriating
The Spirit of God promised alike and given
To all believers and from that pretence
Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force
On every conscience laws which none shall find
Left them inrolled or what the Spirit within
Shall on the heart engrave  What will they then
But force the Spirit of Grace itself and bind
His consort Liberty? what but unbuild
His living temples built by faith to stand
Their own faith not anothers? for on earth
Who against faith and conscience can be heard
Infallible? yet many will presume
Whence heavy persecution shall arise
On all who in the worship persevere
Of spirit and truth the rest far greater part
Will deem in outward rites and specious forms
Religion satisfied Truth shall retire
Bestuck with slanderous darts and works of faith
Rarely be found  So shall the world go on
To good malignant to bad men benign
Under her own weight groaning till the day
Appear of respiration to the just
And vengeance to the wicked at return
Of him so lately promised to thy aid
The Womans Seed obscurely then foretold
Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord
Last in the clouds from Heaven to be revealed
In glory of the Father to dissolve
Satan with his perverted world then raise
From the conflagrant mass purged and refined
New Heavens new Earth ages of endless date
Founded in righteousness and peace and love
To bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss
He ended and thus Adam last replied
How soon hath thy prediction Seer blest
Measured this transient world the race of time
Till time stand fixed  Beyond is all abyss
Eternity whose end no eye can reach
Greatlyinstructed I shall hence depart
Greatly in peace of thought and have my fill
Of knowledge what this vessel can contain
Beyond which was my folly to aspire
Henceforth I learn that to obey is best
And love with fear the only God to walk
As in his presence ever to observe
His providence and on him sole depend
Merciful over all his works with good
Still overcoming evil and by small
Accomplishing great things by things deemed weak
Subverting worldly strong and worldly wise
By simply meek that suffering for truths sake
Is fortitude to highest victory
And to the faithful death the gate of life
Taught this by his example whom I now
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest
To whom thus also the Angel last replied
This having learned thou hast attained the sum
Of wisdom hope no higher though all the stars
Thou knewest by name and all the ethereal powers
All secrets of the deep all Natures works
Or works of God in Heaven air earth or sea
And all the riches of this world enjoyedst
And all the rule one empire only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith
Add virtue patience temperance add love
By name to come called charity the soul
Of all the rest then wilt thou not be loth
To leave this Paradise but shalt possess
A Paradise within thee happier far
Let us descend now therefore from this top
Of speculation for the hour precise
Exacts our parting hence and seethe guards
By me encamped on yonder hill expect
Their motion at whose front a flaming sword
In signal of remove waves fiercely round
We may no longer stay go waken Eve
Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed
Portending good and all her spirits composed
To meek submission thou at season fit
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard
Chiefly what may concern her faith to know
The great deliverance by her seed to come
For by the Womans seed on all mankind
That ye may live which will be many days
Both in one faith unanimous though sad
With cause for evils past yet much more cheered
With meditation on the happy end
He ended and they both descend the hill
Descended Adam to the bower where Eve
Lay sleeping ran before but found her waked
And thus with words not sad she him received
Whence thou returnest and whither wentest I know
For God is also in sleep and dreams advise
Which he hath sent propitious some great good
Presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress
Wearied I fell asleep  But now lead on
In me is no delay with thee to go
Is to stay here without thee here to stay
Is to go hence unwilling thou to me
Art all things under Heaven all places thou
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence
This further consolation yet secure
I carry hence though all by me is lost
Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore
So spake our mother Eve and Adam heard
Well pleased but answered not  For now too nigh
The ArchAngel stood and from the other hill
To their fixed station all in bright array
The Cherubim descended on the ground
Gliding meteorous as eveningmist
Risen from a river oer the marish glides
And gathers ground fast at the labourers heel
Homeward returning  High in front advanced
The brandished sword of God before them blazed
Fierce as a comet which with torrid heat
And vapour as the Libyan air adust
Began to parch that temperate clime whereat
In either hand the hastening Angel caught
Our lingering parents and to the eastern gate
Led them direct and down the cliff as fast
To the subjected plain then disappeared
They looking back all the eastern side beheld
Of Paradise so late their happy seat
Waved over by that flaming brand the gate
With dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms
Some natural tears they dropt but wiped them soon
The world was all before them where to choose
Their place of rest and Providence their guide
They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow
Through Eden took their solitary way
