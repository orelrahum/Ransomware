                ALICES ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

                          Lewis Carroll

               THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 




                            CHAPTER I

                      Down the RabbitHole


  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
on the bank and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no
pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book
thought Alice without pictures or conversation?

  So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether
the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble
of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a White
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her

  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that nor did Alice
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
itself Oh dear  Oh dear  I shall be late  when she thought
it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have
wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural
but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT
POCKET and looked at it and then hurried on Alice started to
her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to
take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the
field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbithole under the hedge

  In another moment down went Alice after it never once
considering how in the world she was to get out again

  The rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way
and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a
moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
falling down a very deep well

  Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
wonder what was going to happen next  First she tried to look
down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to
see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs  She
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was
labelled ORANGE MARMALADE but to her great disappointment it
was empty  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
fell past it

  Well thought Alice to herself after such a fall as this I
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs  How brave theyll
all think me at home  Why I wouldnt say anything about it
even if I fell off the top of the house Which was very likely
true

  Down down down  Would the fall NEVER come to an end  I
wonder how many miles Ive fallen by this time? she said aloud
I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth  Let
me see  that would be four thousand miles down I think for
you see Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a VERY good
opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to
listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes
thats about the right distancebut then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude Ive got to?  Alice had no idea what Latitude was
or Longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to
say

  Presently she began again  I wonder if I shall fall right
THROUGH the earth  How funny itll seem to come out among the
people that walk with their heads downward  The Antipathies I
think she was rather glad there WAS no one listening this
time as it didnt sound at all the right word but I shall
have to ask them what the name of the country is you know
Please Maam is this New Zealand or Australia? and she tried
to curtsey as she spokefancy CURTSEYING as youre falling
through the air  Do you think you could manage it?  And what
an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking  No itll
never do to ask  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere

  Down down down  There was nothing else to do so Alice soon
began talking again  Dinahll miss me very much tonight I
should think  Dinah was the cat  I hope theyll remember
her saucer of milk at teatime  Dinah my dear  I wish you were
down here with me  There are no mice in the air Im afraid but
you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know
But do cats eat bats I wonder?  And here Alice began to get
rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of
way Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats? and sometimes Do
bats eat cats? for you see as she couldnt answer either
question it didnt much matter which way she put it  She felt
that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she
was walking hand in hand with Dinah and saying to her very
earnestly Now Dinah tell me the truth  did you ever eat a
bat? when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of
sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over

  Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a
moment  she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her
was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in
sight hurrying down it  There was not a moment to be lost
away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it
say as it turned a corner Oh my ears and whiskers how late
its getting  She was close behind it when she turned the
corner but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found
herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps
hanging from the roof

  There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle
wondering how she was ever to get out again

  Suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of
solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key
and Alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the
doors of the hall but alas either the locks were too large or
the key was too small but at any rate it would not open any of
them  However on the second time round she came upon a low
curtain she had not noticed before and behind it was a little
door about fifteen inches high  she tried the little golden key
in the lock and to her great delight it fitted

  Alice opened the door and found that it led into a small
passage not much larger than a rathole  she knelt down and
looked along the passage into the loveliest garden you ever saw
How she longed to get out of that dark hall and wander about
among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but
she could not even get her head though the doorway and even if
my head would go through thought poor Alice it would be of
very little use without my shoulders  Oh how I wish
I could shut up like a telescope  I think I could if I only
know how to begin  For you see so many outoftheway things
had happened lately that Alice had begun to think that very few
things indeed were really impossible

  There seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she
went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on
it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like
telescopes  this time she found a little bottle on it which
certainly was not here before said Alice and round the neck
of the bottle was a paper label with the words DRINK ME
beautifully printed on it in large letters

  It was all very well to say Drink me but the wise little
Alice was not going to do THAT in a hurry  No Ill look
first she said and see whether its marked "poison" or not
for she had read several nice little histories about children who
had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant
things all because they WOULD not remember the simple rules
their friends had taught them  such as that a redhot poker
will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your
finger VERY deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had
never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked
poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or
later

  However this bottle was NOT marked poison so Alice ventured
to taste it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort
of mixed flavour of cherrytart custard pineapple roast
turkey toffee and hot buttered toast she very soon finished
it off

                                               

                                            

                                               

  What a curious feeling said Alice I must be shutting up
like a telescope

  And so it was indeed  she was now only ten inches high and
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right
size for going though the little door into that lovely garden
First however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was
going to shrink any further  she felt a little nervous about
this for it might end you know said Alice to herself in my
going out altogether like a candle  I wonder what I should be
like then?  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is
like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember
ever having seen such a thing

  After a while finding that nothing more happened she decided
on going into the garden at once but alas for poor Alice when
she got to the door she found he had forgotten the little golden
key and when she went back to the table for it she found she
could not possibly reach it  she could see it quite plainly
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the
legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had
tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and
cried

  Come theres no use in crying like that said Alice to
herself rather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute
She generally gave herself very good advice though she very
seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so
severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered
trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game
of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious
child was very fond of pretending to be two people  But its no
use now thought poor Alice to pretend to be two people  Why
theres hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable
person

  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
the table  she opened it and found in it a very small cake on
which the words EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants
Well Ill eat it said Alice and if it makes me grow larger
I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep
under the door so either way Ill get into the garden and I
dont care which happens

  She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself Which
way?  Which way? holding her hand on the top of her head to
feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to
find that she remained the same size  to be sure this generally
happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the
way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
common way

  So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake

                                               

                                            

                                               




                           CHAPTER II

                        The Pool of Tears


  Curiouser and curiouser cried Alice she was so much
surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good
English now Im opening out like the largest telescope that
ever was  Goodbye feet for when she looked down at her
feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so
far off  Oh my poor little feet I wonder who will put on
your shoes and stockings for you now dears?  Im sure I shant
be able  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
about you  you must manage the best way you can but I must be
kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they wont walk the
way I want to go  Let me see  Ill give them a new pair of
boots every Christmas

  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it
They must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll
seem sending presents to ones own feet  And how odd the
directions will look

            ALICES RIGHT FOOT ESQ
                HEARTHRUG
                    NEAR THE FENDER
                        WITH ALICES LOVE

Oh dear what nonsense Im talking

  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in
fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door

  Poor Alice  It was as much as she could do lying down on one
side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get
through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to
cry again

  You ought to be ashamed of yourself said Alice a great
girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in
this way  Stop this moment I tell you  But she went on all
the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool
all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the
hall

  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the
distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
It was the White Rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
other  he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to
himself as he came Oh the Duchess the Duchess Oh wont she
be savage if Ive kept her waiting  Alice felt so desperate
that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the Rabbit
came near her she began in a low timid voice If you please
sir  The Rabbit started violently dropped the white kid
gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard
as he could go

  Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very
hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking
Dear dear  How queer everything is today  And yesterday
things went on just as usual  I wonder if Ive been changed iA
