She dictate false and misinform the will
To do what God expressly hath forbid
Not then mistrust but tender love enjoins
That I should mind thee oft and mind thou me
Firm we subsist yet possible to swerve
Since Reason not impossibly may meet
Some specious object by the foe suborned
And fall into deception unaware
Not keeping strictest watch as she was warned
Seek not temptation then which to avoid
Were better and most likely if from me
Thou sever not Trial will come unsought
Wouldst thou approve thy constancy approve
First thy obedience the other who can know
Not seeing thee attempted who attest?
But if thou think trial unsought may find
Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest
Go for thy stay not free absents thee more
Go in thy native innocence rely
On what thou hast of virtue summon all
For God towards thee hath done his part do thine
So spake the patriarch of mankind but Eve
Persisted yet submiss though last replied
With thy permission then and thus forewarned
Chiefly by what thy own last reasoning words
Touched only that our trial when least sought
May find us both perhaps far less prepared
The willinger I go nor much expect
A foe so proud will first the weaker seek
So bent the more shall shame him his repulse
Thus saying from her husbands hand her hand
Soft she withdrew and like a WoodNymph light
Oread or Dryad or of Delias train
Betook her to the groves but Delias self
In gait surpassed and Goddesslike deport
Though not as she with bow and quiver armed
But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude
Guiltless of fire had formed or Angels brought
To Pales or Pomona thus adorned
Likest she seemed Pomona when she fled
Vertumnus or to Ceres in her prime
Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove
Her long with ardent look his eye pursued
Delighted but desiring more her stay
Oft he to her his charge of quick return
Repeated she to him as oft engaged
To be returned by noon amid the bower
And all things in best order to invite
Noontide repast or afternoons repose
O much deceived much failing hapless Eve
Of thy presumed return event perverse
Thou never from that hour in Paradise
Foundst either sweet repast or sound repose
Such ambush hid among sweet flowers and shades
Waited with hellish rancour imminent
To intercept thy way or send thee back
Despoiled of innocence of faith of bliss
For now and since first break of dawn the Fiend
Mere serpent in appearance forth was come
And on his quest where likeliest he might find
The only two of mankind but in them
The whole included race his purposed prey
In bower and field he sought where any tuft
Of grove or gardenplot more pleasant lay
Their tendance or plantation for delight
By fountain or by shady rivulet
He sought them both but wished his hap might find
Eve separate he wished but not with hope
Of what so seldom chanced when to his wish
Beyond his hope Eve separate he spies
Veiled in a cloud of fragrance where she stood
Half spied so thick the roses blushing round
About her glowed oft stooping to support
Each flower of slender stalk whose head though gay
Carnation purple azure or specked with gold
Hung drooping unsustained them she upstays
Gently with myrtle band mindless the while
Herself though fairest unsupported flower
From her best prop so far and storm so nigh
Nearer he drew and many a walk traversed
Of stateliest covert cedar pine or palm
Then voluble and bold now hid now seen
Among thickwoven arborets and flowers
Imbordered on each bank the hand of Eve
Spot more delicious than those gardens feigned
Or of revived Adonis or renowned
Alcinous host of old Laertes son
Or that not mystick where the sapient king
Held dalliance with his fair Egyptian spouse
Much he the place admired the person more
As one who long in populous city pent
Where houses thick and sewers annoy the air
Forth issuing on a summers morn to breathe
Among the pleasant villages and farms
Adjoined from each thing met conceives delight
The smell of grain or tedded grass or kine
Or dairy each rural sight each rural sound
If chance with nymphlike step fair virgin pass
What pleasing seemed for her now pleases more
She most and in her look sums all delight
Such pleasure took the Serpent to behold
This flowery plat the sweet recess of Eve
Thus early thus alone Her heavenly form
Angelick but more soft and feminine
Her graceful innocence her every air
Of gesture or least action overawed
His malice and with rapine sweet bereaved
His fierceness of the fierce intent it brought
That space the Evilone abstracted stood
From his own evil and for the time remained
Stupidly good of enmity disarmed
Of guile of hate of envy of revenge
But the hot Hell that always in him burns
Though in mid Heaven soon ended his delight
And tortures him now more the more he sees
Of pleasure not for him ordained then soon
Fierce hate he recollects and all his thoughts
Of mischief gratulating thus excites
Thoughts whither have ye led me with what sweet
Compulsion thus transported to forget
What hither brought us hate not lovenor hope
Of Paradise for Hell hope here to taste
Of pleasure but all pleasure to destroy
Save what is in destroying other joy
To me is lost  Then let me not let pass
Occasion which now smiles behold alone
The woman opportune to all attempts
Her husband for I view far round not nigh
Whose higher intellectual more I shun
And strength of courage haughty and of limb
Heroick built though of terrestrial mould
Foe not informidable exempt from wound
I not so much hath Hell debased and pain
Enfeebled me to what I was in Heaven
She fair divinely fair fit love for Gods
Not terrible though terrour be in love
And beauty not approached by stronger hate
Hate stronger under show of love well feigned
The way which to her ruin now I tend
So spake the enemy of mankind enclosed
In serpent inmate bad and toward Eve
Addressed his way not with indented wave
Prone on the ground as since but on his rear
Circular base of rising folds that towered
Fold above fold a surging maze his head
Crested aloft and carbuncle his eyes
With burnished neck of verdant gold erect
Amidst his circling spires that on the grass
Floated redundant pleasing was his shape
And lovely never since of serpentkind
Lovelier not those that in Illyria changed
Hermione and Cadmus or the god
In Epidaurus nor to which transformed
Ammonian Jove or Capitoline was seen
He with Olympias this with her who bore
Scipio the highth of Rome  With tract oblique
At first as one who sought access but feared
To interrupt sidelong he works his way
As when a ship by skilful steersmen wrought
Nigh rivers mouth or foreland where the wind
Veers oft as oft so steers and shifts her sail
So varied he and of his tortuous train
Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve
To lure her eye she busied heard the sound
Of rusling leaves but minded not as used
To such disport before her through the field
From every beast more duteous at her call
Than at Circean call the herd disguised
He bolder now uncalled before her stood
But as in gaze admiring oft he bowed
His turret crest and sleek enamelled neck
Fawning and licked the ground whereon she trod
His gentle dumb expression turned at length
The eye of Eve to mark his play he glad
Of her attention gained with serpenttongue
Organick or impulse of vocal air
His fraudulent temptation thus began
Wonder not sovran Mistress if perhaps
Thou canst who art sole wonder much less arm
Thy looks the Heaven of mildness with disdain
Displeased that I approach thee thus and gaze
Insatiate I thus singlenor have feared
Thy awful brow more awful thus retired
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair
Thee all things living gaze on all things thine
By gift and thy celestial beauty adore
With ravishment beheld there best beheld
Where universally admired but here
In this enclosure wild these beasts among
Beholders rude and shallow to discern
Half what in thee is fair one man except
Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen
A Goddess among Gods adored and served
By Angels numberless thy daily train
So glozed the Tempter and his proem tuned
Into the heart of Eve his words made way
Though at the voice much marvelling at length
Not unamazed she thus in answer spake
What may this mean? language of man pronounced
By tongue of brute and human sense expressed?
The first at least of these I thought denied
To beasts whom God on their creationday
Created mute to all articulate sound
The latter I demur for in their looks
Much reason and in their actions oft appears
Thee Serpent subtlest beast of all the field
I knew but not with human voice endued
Redouble then this miracle and say
How camest thou speakable of mute and how
To me so friendly grown above the rest
Of brutal kind that daily are in sight?
Say for such wonder claims attention due
To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied
Empress of this fair world resplendent Eve
Easy to me it is to tell thee all
What thou commandest and right thou shouldst be obeyed
I was at first as other beasts that graze
The trodden herb of abject thoughts and low
As was my food nor aught but food discerned
Or sex and apprehended nothing high
Till on a day roving the field I chanced
A goodly tree far distant to behold
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed
Ruddy and gold I nearer drew to gaze
When from the boughs a savoury odour blown
Grateful to appetite more pleased my sense
Than smell of sweetest fennel or the teats
Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even
Unsucked of lamb or kid that tend their play
To satisfy the sharp desire I had
Of tasting those fair apples I resolved
Not to defer hunger and thirst at once
Powerful persuaders quickened at the scent
Of that alluring fruit urged me so keen
About the mossy trunk I wound me soon
For high from ground the branches would require
Thy utmost reach or Adams Round the tree
All other beasts that saw with like desire
Longing and envying stood but could not reach
Amid the tree now got where plenty hung
Tempting so nigh to pluck and eat my fill
I spared not for such pleasure till that hour
At feed or fountain never had I found
Sated at length ere long I might perceive
Strange alteration in me to degree
Of reason in my inward powers and speech
Wanted not long though to this shape retained
Thenceforth to speculations high or deep
I turned my thoughts and with capacious mind
Considered all things visible in Heaven
Or Earth or Middle all things fair and good
But all that fair and good in thy divine
Semblance and in thy beautys heavenly ray
United I beheld no fair to thine
Equivalent or second which compelled
Me thus though importune perhaps to come
And gaze and worship thee of right declared
Sovran of creatures universal Dame
So talked the spirited sly Snake and Eve
Yet more amazed unwary thus replied
Serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt
The virtue of that fruit in thee first proved
But say where grows the tree? from hence how far?
For many are the trees of God that grow
In Paradise and various yet unknown
To us in such abundance lies our choice
As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched
Still hanging incorruptible till men
Grow up to their provision and more hands
Help to disburden Nature of her birth
To whom the wily Adder blithe and glad
Empress the way is ready and not long
Beyond a row of myrtles on a flat
Fast by a fountain one small thicket past
Of blowing myrrh and balm if thou accept
My conduct I can bring thee thither soon
Lead then said Eve  He leading swiftly rolled
In tangles and made intricate seem straight
To mischief swift  Hope elevates and joy
Brightens his crest as when a wandering fire
Compact of unctuous vapour which the night
Condenses and the cold environs round
Kindled through agitation to a flame
Which oft they say some evil Spirit attends
Hovering and blazing with delusive light
Misleads the amazed nightwanderer from his way
To bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool
There swallowed up and lost from succour far
So glistered the dire Snake and into fraud
Led Eve our credulous mother to the tree
Of prohibition root of all our woe
Which when she saw thus to her guide she spake
Serpent we might have spared our coming hither
Fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess
The credit of whose virtue rest with thee
Wonderous indeed if cause of such effects
But of this tree we may not taste nor touch
God so commanded and left that command
Sole daughter of his voice the rest we live
Law to ourselves our reason is our law
To whom the Tempter guilefully replied
Indeed hath God then said that of the fruit
Of all these gardentrees ye shall not eat
Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air?
To whom thus Eve yet sinless  Of the fruit
Of each tree in the garden we may eat
But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
The garden God hath said Ye shall not eat
Thereof nor shall ye touch it lest ye die
She scarce had said though brief when now more bold
The Tempter but with show of zeal and love
To Man and indignation at his wrong
New part puts on and as to passion moved
Fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act
Raised as of some great matter to begin
As when of old some orator renowned
In Athens or free Rome where eloquence
Flourished since mute to some great cause addressed
Stood in himself collected while each part
Motion each act won audience ere the tongue
Sometimes in highth began as no delay
Of preface brooking through his zeal of right
So standing moving or to highth up grown
The Tempter all impassioned thus began
O sacred wise and wisdomgiving Plant
Mother of science now I feel thy power
Within me clear not only to discern
Things in their causes but to trace the ways
Of highest agents deemed however wise
Queen of this universe do not believe
Those rigid threats of death ye shall not die
How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life
To knowledge by the threatener? look on me
Me who have touched and tasted yet both live
And life more perfect have attained than Fate
Meant me by venturing higher than my lot
Shall that be shut to Man which to the Beast
Is open? or will God incense his ire
For such a petty trespass? and not praise
Rather your dauntless virtue whom the pain
Of death denounced whatever thing death be
Deterred not from achieving what might lead
To happier life knowledge of good and evil
Of good how just? of evil if what is evil
Be real why not known since easier shunned?
God therefore cannot hurt ye and be just
Not just not God not feared then nor obeyed
Your fear itself of death removes the fear
Why then was this forbid?  Why but to awe
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant
His worshippers?  He knows that in the day
Ye eat thereof your eyes that seem so clear
Yet are but dim shall perfectly be then
Opened and cleared and ye shall be as Gods
Knowing both good and evil as they know
That ye shall be as Gods since I as Man
Internal Man is but proportion meet
I of brute human ye of human Gods
So ye shall die perhaps by putting off
Human to put on Gods death to be wished
Though threatened which no worse than this can bring
And what are Gods that Man may not become
As they participating Godlike food?
The Gods are first and that advantage use
On our belief that all from them proceeds
I question it for this fair earth I see
Warmed by the sun producing every kind
Them nothing if they all things who enclosed
Knowledge of good and evil in this tree
That whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies
The offence that Man should thus attain to know?
What can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
Impart against his will if all be his?
Or is it envy? and can envy dwell
In heavenly breasts?  These these and many more
Causes import your need of this fair fruit
Goddess humane reach then and freely taste
He ended and his words replete with guile
Into her heart too easy entrance won
Fixed on the fruit she gazed which to behold
Might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
Yet rung of his persuasive words impregned
With reason to her seeming and with truth
Mean while the hour of noon drew on and waked
An eager appetite raised by the smell
So savoury of that fruit which with desire
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste
Solicited her longing eye yet first
Pausing a while thus to herself she mused
Great are thy virtues doubtless best of fruits
Though kept from man and worthy to be admired
Whose taste too long forborn at first assay
Gave elocution to the mute and taught
The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise
Thy praise he also who forbids thy use
Conceals not from us naming thee the tree
Of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil
Forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
Commends thee more while it infers the good
By thee communicated and our want
For good unknown sure is not had or had
And yet unknown is as not had at all
In plain then what forbids he but to know
Forbids us good forbids us to be wise?
Such prohibitions bind not  But if death
Bind us with afterbands what profits then
Our inward freedom?  In the day we eat
Of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die
How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives
And knows and speaks and reasons and discerns
Irrational till then  For us alone
Was death invented? or to us denied
This intellectual food for beasts VEKXJMIV?
