SCENE III	The forest


	Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

TOUCHSTONE	Tomorrow is the joyful day Audrey tomorrow will

AUDREY	I do desire it with all my heart and I hope it is
	no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the
	world Here comes two of the banished dukes pages

	Enter two Pages

First Page	Well met honest gentleman

TOUCHSTONE	By my troth well met Come sit sit and a song

Second Page	We are for you sit i the middle

First Page	Shall we clap intot roundly without hawking or
	spitting or saying we are hoarse which are the only
	prologues to a bad voice?

Second Page	Ifaith ifaith and both in a tune like two
	gipsies on a horse

	SONG
	It was a lover and his lass
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	That oer the green cornfield did pass
	In the spring time the only pretty ring time
	When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
	Sweet lovers love the spring

	Between the acres of the rye
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	These pretty country folks would lie
	In spring time c

	This carol they began that hour
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	How that a life was but a flower
	In spring time c

	And therefore take the present time
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	For love is crowned with the prime
	In spring time c

TOUCHSTONE	Truly young gentlemen though there was no great
	matter in the ditty yet the note was very
	untuneable

First Page	You are deceived sir we kept time we lost not our time

TOUCHSTONE	By my troth yes I count it but time lost to hear
	such a foolish song God be wi you and God mend
	your voices Come Audrey

	Exeunt

	Of many desperate studies by his uncle
	Whom he reports to be a great magician
	Obscured in the circle of this forest

	couples are coming to the ark Here comes a pair of
	very strange beasts which in all tongues are called fools

	motleyminded gentleman that I have so often met in
	the forest he hath been a courtier he swears

	purgation I have trod a measure I have flattered
	a lady I have been politic with my friend smooth
	with mine enemy I have undone three tailors I have
	had four quarrels and like to have fought one

JAQUES	And how was that taen up?

TOUCHSTONE	Faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the
	seventh cause

DUKE SENIOR	I like him very well

TOUCHSTONE	God ild you sir I desire you of the like I
	press in here sir amongst the rest of the country
	copulatives to swear and to forswear according as
	marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin
	sir an illfavoured thing sir but mine own a poor
	humour of mine sir to take that that no man else
	will rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a
	poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster
