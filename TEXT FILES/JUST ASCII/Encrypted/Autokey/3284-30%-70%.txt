Martinique Economy

Overview
    The economy is based on sugarcane bananas tourism and light industry
    Agriculture accounts for about  of GDP and the small industrial sector
    for  Sugar production has declined with most of the sugarcane now used
    for the production of rum Banana exports are increasing going mostly to
    France The bulk of meat vegetable and grain requirements must be
    imported contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
    transfers of aid from France Tourism has become more important than
    agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange The majority of the
    work force is employed in the service sector and in administration In 
    per capita GDP was relatively high at  During  the unemployment

Mauritania Economy

Overview
    A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for
    a livelihood even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers
    were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the s and s
    Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore which account for almost 
    of total exports The decline in world demand for this ore however has led
    to cutbacks in production The nations coastal waters are among the richest
    fishing areas in the world but overexploitation by foreigners threatens
    this key source of revenue The countrys first deepwater port opened near
    Nouakchott in  In recent years the droughts the endemic conflict with
    Senegal rising energy costs and economic mismanagement have resulted in a
    substantial buildup of foreign debt The government has begun the second
    stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank the
    IMF and major donor countries But the reform process suffered a major
    setback following the Gulf war of early  Because of Mauritanias
    support of Saddam Husayn bilateral aid from its two top donors Saudi
    Arabia and Kuwait was suspended and multilateral aid was reduced
