Burma Economy

Overview
    Burma is a poor Asian country with a per capita GDP of about  The
    nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export
    earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity exports
    For rice traditionally the most important export the drop in world prices
    has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales In
     teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this
    position The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector which
    generates about  of GDP and provides employment for  of the work
    force Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces
    and has been trying to encourage foreign investment so far with little
    success

Burundi Economy

Overview
    A landlocked resourcepoor country in an early stage of economic
    development Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
    industries Its economic health depends on the coffee crop which accounts
    for an average  of foreign exchange earnings each year The ability to
    pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
    climate and the international coffee market As part of its economic reform
    agenda launched in February  with IMF and World Bank support Burundi
    is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability and attract foreign
    investment in industry Several stateowned coffee companies were privatized
    via public auction in September
