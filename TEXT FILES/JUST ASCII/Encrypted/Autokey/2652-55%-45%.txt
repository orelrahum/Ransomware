Encroaching Eve perhaps had first the rule
Of high Olympus thence by Saturn driven
And Ops ere yet Dictaean Jove was born
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
Too soon arrived Sin there in power before
Once actual now in body and to dwell
Habitual habitant behind her Death
Close following pace for pace not mounted yet
On his pale horse to whom Sin thus began
Second of Satan sprung allconquering Death
What thinkest thou of our empire now though earned
With travel difficult not better far
Than still at Hells dark threshold to have sat watch
Unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved?
Whom thus the Sinborn monster answered soon
To me who with eternal famine pine
Alike is Hell or Paradise or Heaven
There best where most with ravine I may meet
Which here though plenteous all too little seems
To stuff this maw this vast unhidebound corps
To whom the incestuous mother thus replied
Thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flowers
Feed first on each beast next and fish and fowl
No homely morsels and whatever thing
The sithe of Time mows down devour unspared
Till I in Man residing through the race
His thoughts his looks words actions all infect
And season him thy last and sweetest prey
This said they both betook them several ways
Both to destroy or unimmortal make
All kinds and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later which the Almighty seeing
From his transcendent seat the Saints among
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice
See with what heat these dogs of Hell advance
To waste and havock yonder world which I
So fair and good created and had still
Kept in that state had not the folly of Man
Let in these wasteful furies who impute
Folly to me so doth the Prince of Hell
And his adherents that with so much ease
I suffer them to enter and possess
A place so heavenly and conniving seem
To gratify my scornful enemies
That laugh as if transported with some fit
Of passion I to them had quitted all
At random yielded up to their misrule
And know not that I called and drew them thither
My Hellhounds to lick up the draff and filth
Which Mans polluting sin with taint hath shed
On what was pure til crammed and gorged nigh burst
With sucked and glutted offal at one sling
Of thy victorious arm wellpleasing Son
Both Sin and Death and yawning Grave at last
Through Chaos hurled obstruct the mouth of Hell
For ever and seal up his ravenous jaws
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure
To sanctity that shall receive no stain
Till then the curse pronounced on both precedes
He ended and the heavenly audience loud
Sung Halleluiah as the sound of seas
