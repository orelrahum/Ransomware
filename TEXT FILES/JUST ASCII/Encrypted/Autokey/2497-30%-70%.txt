construction and operation of multigigabyte networks

LARSENs objective is to use the networks and library systems now being
constructed to increase access to resources wherever they exist and
thus to evolve toward an online electronic virtual library

LARSEN concluded by offering a snapshot of current trends  continuing
geometric growth in network capacity and number of users slower
development of applications and glacial development and adoption of
standards  The challenge is to design and develop each new application
system with network access and scalability in mind

Edwin BROWNRIGG executive director Memex Research Institute first
polled the audience in order to seek out regular users of the Internet as
well as those planning to use it some time in the future  With nearly
everybody in the room falling into one category or the other BROWNRIGG
made a point re access namely that numerous individuals especially those
who use the Internet every day take for granted their access to it the
speeds with which they are connected and how well it all works
However as BROWNRIGG discovered between  and  in Australia
if one wants access to the Internet but cannot afford it or has some
physical boundary that prevents her or him from gaining access it can
be extremely frustrating  He suggested that because of economics and
physical barriers we were beginning to create a world of haves and havenots
in the process of scholarly communication even in the United States

BROWNRIGG detailed the development of MELVYL in academic year  in
the Division of Library Automation at the University of California in
order to underscore the issue of access to the system which at the
outset was extremely limited  In short the project needed to build a
network which at that time entailed use of satellite technology that is
putting earth stations on campus and also acquiring some terrestrial links
from the State of Californias microwave system  The installation of
satellite links however did not solve the problem which actually
formed part of a larger problem involving politics and financial resources
For while the project team could get a signal onto a campus it had no means
of distributing the signal throughout the campus  The solution involved
adopting a recent development in wireless communication called packet radio
which combined the basic notion of packetswitching with radio  The project
used this technology to get the signal from a point on campus where it
came down an earth station for example into the libraries because it
found that wiring the libraries especially the older marble buildings
would cost  per terminal

BROWNRIGG noted that ten years ago the project had neither the public
policy nor the technology that would have allowed it to use packet radio
in any meaningful way  Since then much had changed  He proceeded to
detail research and development of the technology how it is being
deployed in California and what direction he thought it would take
The design criteria are to produce a highspeed onetime lowcost
highquality secure licensefree device packet radio that one can
plug in and play today forget about it and have access to the Internet
By high speed BROWNRIGG meant  megabyte and  megabytes  Those units
have been built he continued and are in the process of being
typecertified by an independent underwriting laboratory so that they can
be typelicensed by the Federal Communications Commission  As is the
case with citizens band one will be able to purchase a unit and not have
to worry about applying for a license

The basic idea BROWNRIGG elaborated is to take highspeed radio data
transmission and create a backbone network that at certain strategic
points in the network will "gateway" into a mediumspeed packet radio
ie one that runs at  kilobytes so that perhaps by 
people like those in the audience for the price of a VCR could purchase
a mediumspeed radio for the office or home have full network connectivity
to the Internet and partake of all its services with no need for an FCC
license and no regular bill from the local common carrier  BROWNRIGG
presented several details of a demonstration project currently taking
place in San Diego and described plans pending funding to install a
fullbore network in the San Francisco area  This network will have 
nodes running at backbone speeds and  of these nodes will be libraries
which in turn will be the gateway ports to the  kilobyte radios that
will give coverage for the neighborhoods surrounding the libraries

BROWNRIGG next explained Part  a new rule within Title  of the
Code of Federal Regulations enacted by the FCC in   This rule
challenged the industry which has only now risen to the occasion to
build a radio that would run at no more than one watt of output power and
use a fairly exotic method of modulating the radio wave called spread
spectrum  Spread spectrum in fact permits the building of networks so
that numerous data communications can occur simultaneously without
interfering with each other within the same wide radio channel

BROWNRIGG explained that the frequencies at which the radios would run
are very short wave signals  They are well above standard microwave and
radar  With a radio wave that small one watt becomes a tremendous punch
per bit and thus makes transmission at reasonable speed possible  In
order to minimize the potential for congestion the project is
undertaking to reimplement software which has been available in the
networking business and is taken for granted now for example TCPIP
routing algorithms bridges and gateways  In addition the project
plans to take the WAIS server software in the public domain and
reimplement it so that one can have a WAIS server on a Mac instead of a
Unix machine  The Memex Research Institute believes that libraries in
particular will want to use the WAIS servers with packet radio  This
project which has a team of about twelve people will run through 
and will include the  libraries already mentioned as well as other
professionals such as those in the medical profession engineering and
law  Thus the need is to create an infrastructure of radios that do not
move around which BROWNRIGG hopes will solve a problem not only for
libraries but for individuals who by and large today do not have access
to the Internet from their homes and offices

                                 


DISCUSSION  Project operating frequencies 


During a brief discussion period which also concluded the days
proceedings BROWNRIGG stated that the project was operating in four
frequencies  The slow speed is operating at  megahertz and it would
later go up to  megahertz  With the highspeed frequency the
onemegabyte radios will run at  gigabits and  will run at 
At  rain can be a factor but it would have to be tropical rain
unlike what falls in most parts of the United States

                                 

SESSION IV  IMAGE CAPTURE TEXT CAPTURE OVERVIEW OF TEXT AND
             IMAGE STORAGE FORMATS

William HOOTON vice president of operations INET moderated this session


KENNEY  Factors influencing development of CXP  Advantages of using
digital technology versus photocopy and microfilm  A primary goal of
CXP publishing challenges  Characteristics of copies printed  Quality
of samples achieved in image capture  Several factors to be considered
in choosing scanning  Emphasis of CXP on timely and costeffective
production of blackandwhite printed facsimiles  Results of producing
microfilm from digital files  Advantages of creating microfilm  Details
concerning production  Costs  Role of digital technology in library
preservation 


Anne KENNEY associate director Department of Preservation and
Conservation Cornell University opened her talk by observing that the
Cornell Xerox Project CXP has been guided by the assumption that the
ability to produce printed facsimiles or to replace paper with paper
would be important at least for the present generation of users and
equipment  She described three factors that influenced development of
the project   Because the project has emphasized the preservation of
deteriorating brittle books the quality of what was produced had to be
sufficiently high to return a paper replacement to the shelf  CXP was
only interested in using   a system that was costeffective which
meant that it had to be costcompetitive with the processes currently
available principally photocopy and microfilm and  new or currently
available product hardware and software

KENNEY described the advantages that using digital technology offers over
both photocopy and microfilm   The potential exists to create a higher
quality reproduction of a deteriorating original than conventional
lightlens technology   Because a digital image is an encoded
representation it can be reproduced again and again with no resulting
loss of quality as opposed to the situation with lightlens processes
in which there is discernible difference between a second and a
subsequent generation of an image   A digital image can be manipulated
in a number of ways to improve image capture for example Xerox has
developed a windowing application that enables one to capture a page
containing both text and illustrations in a manner that optimizes the
reproduction of both  With lightlens technology one must choose which
to optimize text or the illustration in preservation microfilming the
current practice is to shoot an illustrated page twice once to highlight
the text and the second time to provide the best capture for the
illustration   A digital image can also be edited density levels
adjusted to remove underlining and stains and to increase legibility for
faint documents   Onscreen inspection can take place at the time of
initial setup and adjustments made prior to scanning factors that
substantially reduce the number of retakes required in quality control

A primary goal of CXP has been to evaluate the paper output printed on
the Xerox DocuTech a highspeed printer that produces dpi pages from
scanned images at a rate of  pages a minute  KENNEY recounted several
publishing challenges to represent faithful and legible reproductions of
the originals that the dpi copy for the most part successfully
captured  For example many of the deteriorating volumes in the project
were heavily illustrated with fine line drawings or halftones or came in
languages such as Japanese in which the buildup of characters comprised
of varying strokes is difficult to reproduce at lower resolutions a
surprising number of them came with annotations and mathematical
formulas which it was critical to be able to duplicate exactly

KENNEY noted that  the copies are being printed on paper that meets the
ANSI standards for performance  the DocuTech printer meets the machine
and toner requirements for proper adhesion of print to page as described
by the National Archives and thus  paper product is considered to be
the archival equivalent of preservation photocopy

KENNEY then discussed several samples of the quality achieved in the
project that had been distributed in a handout for example a copy of a
printondemand version of the  Reed lecture on the steam turbine
which contains halftones line drawings and illustrations embedded in
text the first four loose pages in the volume compared the capture
capabilities of scanning to photocopy for a standard test target the
IEEE standard A  test chart  In all instances scanning proved
superior to photocopy though only slightly more so in one

Conceding the simplistic nature of her review of the quality of scanning
to photocopy KENNEY described it as one representation of the kinds of
settings that could be used with scanning capabilities on the equipment
CXP uses  KENNEY also pointed out that CXP investigated the quality
achieved with binary scanning only and noted the great promise in gray
scale and color scanning whose advantages and disadvantages need to be
examined  She argued further that scanning resolutions and file formats
can represent a complex tradeoff between the time it takes to capture
material file size fidelity to the original and onscreen display and
printing and equipment availability  All these factors must be taken
into consideration

CXP placed primary emphasis on the production in a timely and
costeffective manner of printed facsimiles that consisted largely of
blackandwhite text  With binary scanning large files may be
compressed efficiently and in a lossless manner ie no data is lost in
the process of compressing and decompressing an imagethe exact
bitrepresentation is maintained using Group  CCITT ie the French
acronym for International Consultative Committee for Telegraph and
Telephone compression  CXP was getting compression ratios of about
forty to one  Grayscale compression which primarily uses JPEG is much
less economical and can represent a lossy compression ie not
lossless so that as one compresses and decompresses the illustration
is subtly changed  While binary files produce a highquality printed
version it appears  that other combinations of spatial resolution with
gray andor color hold great promise as well and  that gray scale can
represent a tremendous advantage for onscreen viewing  The quality
associated with binary and gray scale also depends on the equipment used
For instance binary scanning produces a much better copy on a binary
printer

Among CXPs findings concerning the production of microfilm from digital
files KENNEY reported that the digital files for the same Reed lecture
were used to produce sample film using an electron beam recorder  The
resulting film was faithful to the image capture of the digital files
and while CXP felt that the text and image pages represented in the Reed
lecture were superior to that of the lightlens film the resolution
readings for the  dpi were not as high as standard microfilming
KENNEY argued that the standards defined for lightlens technology are
not totally transferable to a digital environment  Moreover they are
based on definition of quality for a preservation copy  Although making
this case will prove to be a long uphill struggle CXP plans to continue
to investigate the issue over the course of the next year

KENNEY concluded this portion of her talk with a discussion of the
advantages of creating film  it can serve as a primary backup and as a
preservation master to the digital file it could then become the print
or production master and service copies could be paper film optical
disks magnetic media or onscreen display

Finally KENNEY presented details re production

      Development and testing of a moderatelyhigh resolution production
     scanning workstation represented a third goal of CXP to date 
     volumes have been scanned or about  images

      The resulting digital files are stored and used to produce
     hardcopy replacements for the originals and additional prints on
     demand although the initial costs are high scanning technology
     offers an affordable means for reformatting brittle material

      A technician in production mode can scan  pages per hour when
     performing singlesheet scanning which is a necessity when working
     with truly brittle paper this figure is expected to increase
     significantly with subsequent iterations of the software from Xerox
     a threemonth timeandcost study of scanning found that the average
     page book would take about an hour and forty minutes to scan
     this figure included the time for setup which involves keying in
     primary bibliographic data going into quality control mode to
     define page size establishing fronttoback registration and
     scanning sample pages to identify a default range of settings for
     the entire bookfunctions not dissimilar to those performed by
     filmers or those preparing a book for photocopy

      The final step in the scanning process involved rescans which
     happily were few and far between representing well under  percent
     of the total pages scanned

In addition to technician time CXP costed out equipment amortized over
four years the cost of storing and refreshing the digital files every
four years and the cost of printing and binding bookcloth binding a
paper reproduction  The total amounted to a little under  per single
page volume with  percent overhead includeda figure competitive
with the prices currently charged by photocopy vendors

Of course with scanning in addition to the paper facsimile one is left
with a digital file from which subsequent copies of the book can be
produced for a fraction of the cost of photocopy with readers afforded
choices in the form of these copies

KENNEY concluded that digital technology offers an electronic means for a
library preservation effort to pay for itself  If a brittlebook program
included the means of disseminating reprints of books that are in demand
by libraries and researchers alike the initial investment in capture
could be recovered and used to preserve additional but less popular
books  She disclosed that an economic model for a selfsustaining
program could be developed for CXPs report to the Commission on
Preservation and Access CPA

KENNEY stressed that the focus of CXP has been on obtaining high quality
in a production environment  The use of digital technology is viewed as
an affordable alternative to other reformatting options

                                 


ANDRE  Overview and history of NATDP  Various agricultural CDROM
products created inhouse and by service bureaus  Pilot project on
Internet transmission  Additional products in progress 


Pamela ANDRE associate director for automation National Agricultural
Text Digitizing Program NATDP National Agricultural Library NAL
presented an overview of NATDP which has been underway at NAL the last
four years before Judith ZIDAR discussed the technical details  ANDRE
defined agricultural information as a broad range of material going from
basic and applied research in the hard sciences to the onepage pamphlets
that are distributed by the cooperative state extension services on such
things as how to grow blueberries

NATDP began in late  with a meeting of representatives from the
landgrant library community to deal with the issue of electronic
information  NAL and fortyfive of these libraries banded together to
establish this projectto evaluate the technology for converting what
were then source documents in paper form into electronic form to provide
access to that digital information and then to distribute it
Distributing that material to the communitythe university community as
well as the extension service community potentially down to the county
levelconstituted the groups chief concern

Since January  when the microcomputerbased scanning system was
installed at NAL NATDP has done a variety of things concerning which
ZIDAR would provide further details  For example the first technology
considered in the projects discussion phase was digital videodisc which
indicates how long ago it was conceived

Over the four years of this project four separate CDROM products on
four different agricultural topics were created two at a
scanningandOCR station installed at NAL and two by service bureaus
Thus NATDP has gained comparative information in terms of those relative
costs  Each of these products contained the full ASCII text as well as
page images of the material or between  and  pages of material
on these disks  Topics included aquaculture food agriculture and
science ie international agriculture and research acid rain and
Agent Orange which was the final product distributed approximately
eighteen months before the Workshop

The third phase of NATDP focused on delivery mechanisms other than
CDROM  At the suggestion of Clifford LYNCH who was a technical
consultant to the project at this point NATDP became involved with the
Internet and initiated a project with the help of North Carolina State
University in which fourteen of the landgrant university libraries are
transmitting digital images over the Internet in response to interlibrary
loan requestsa topic for another meeting  At this point the pilot
project had been completed for about a year and the final report would be
available shortly after the Workshop  In the meantime the projects
success had led to its extension  ANDRE noted that one of the first
things done under the program title was to select a retrieval package to
use with subsequent products Windows Personal Librarian was the package
of choice after a lengthy evaluation

Three additional products had been planned and were in progress

      An arrangement with the American Society of Agronomya
     professional society that has published the Agronomy Journal since
     about to scan and create bitmapped images of its journal
     ASA granted permission first to put and then to distribute this
     material in electronic form to hold it at NAL and to use these
     electronic images as a mechanism to deliver documents or print out
     material for patrons among other uses  Effectively NAL has the
     right to use this material in support of its program
     Significantly this arrangement offers a potential cooperative
     model for working with other professional societies in agriculture
     to try to do the same thingput the journals of particular interest
     to agriculture research into electronic form

      An extension of the earlier product on aquaculture

      The George Washington Carver Papersa joint project with
     Tuskegee University to scan and convert from microfilm some 
     images of Carvers papers letters and drawings

It was anticipated that all of these products would appear no more than
six months after the Workshop

                                 


ZIDAR  A separate arena for scanning  Steps in creating a database 
Image capture with and without performing OCR  Keying in tracking data
 Scanning with electronic and manual tracking  Adjustments during
scanning process  Scanning resolutions  Compression  Deskewing and
filtering  Image capture from microform  the papers and letters of
George Washington Carver  Equipment used for a scanning system 


Judith ZIDAR coordinator National Agricultural Text Digitizing Program
NATDP National Agricultural Library NAL illustrated the technical
details of NATDP including her primary responsibility scanning and
creating databases on a topic and putting them on CDROM

ZIDAR remarked a separate arena from the CDROM projects although the
processing of the material is nearly identical in which NATDP is also
scanning material and loading it on a Next microcomputer which in turn
is linked to NALs integrated library system  Thus searches in NALs
bibliographic database will enable people to pull up actual page images
and text for any documents that have been entered

In accordance with the sessions topic ZIDAR focused her illustrated
talk on image capture offering a primer on the three main steps in the
process   assemble the printed publications  design the database
database design occurs in the process of preparing the material for
scanning this step entails reviewing and organizing the material
defining the contentswhat will constitute a record what kinds of
fields will be captured in terms of author title etc  perform a
certain amount of markup on the paper publications  NAL performs this
task record by record preparing work sheets or some other sort of
tracking material and designing descriptors and other enhancements to be
added to the data that will not be captured from the printed publication
Part of this process also involves determining NATDPs file and directory
structure  NATDP attempts to avoid putting more than approximately 
images in a directory because placing more than that on a CDROM would
reduce the access speed

This upfront process takes approximately two weeks for a
page database  The next step is to capture the page images
How long this process takes is determined by the decision whether or not
to perform OCR  Not performing OCR speeds the process whereas text
capture requires greater care because of the quality of the image  it
has to be straighter and allowance must be made for text on a page not
just for the capture of photographs

NATDP keys in tracking data that is a standard bibliographic record
including the title of the book and the title of the chapter which will
later either become the access information or will be attached to the
front of a fulltext record so that it is searchable

Images are scanned from a bound or unbound publication chiefly from
bound publications in the case of NATDP however because often they are
the only copies and the publications are returned to the shelves  NATDP
usually scans one record at a time because its database tracking system
tracks the document in that way and does not require further logical
separating of the images  After performing optical character
recognition NATDP moves the images off the hard disk and maintains a
volume sheet  Though the system tracks electronically all the
processing steps are also tracked manually with a log sheet

ZIDAR next illustrated the kinds of adjustments that one can make when
scanning from paper and microfilm for example redoing images that need
special handling setting for dithering or gray scale and adjusting for
brightness or for the whole book at one time

NATDP is scanning at  dots per inch a standard scanning resolution
Though adequate for capturing text that is all of a standard size 
dpi is unsuitable for any kind of photographic material or for very small
text  Many scanners allow for different image formats TIFF of course
being a de facto standard  But if one intends to exchange images with
other people the ability to scan other image formats even if they are
less common becomes highly desirable

CCITT Group  is the standard compression for normal blackandwhite
images JPEG for gray scale or color   ZIDAR recommended  using the
standard compressions particularly if one attempts to make material
available and to allow users to download images and reuse them from
CDROMs and  maintaining the ability to output an uncompressed image
because in image exchange uncompressed images are more likely to be able
to cross platforms

ZIDAR emphasized the importance of deskewing and filtering as
requirements on NATDPs upgraded system  For instance scanning bound
books particularly books published by the federal government whose pages
are skewed and trying to scan them straight if OCR is to be performed
is extremely timeconsuming  The same holds for filtering of
poorquality or older materials

ZIDAR described image capture from microform using as an example three
reels from a sixtysevenreel set of the papers and letters of George
Washington Carver that had been produced by Tuskegee University  These
resulted in approximately  images which NATDP had had scanned by
its service contractor Science Applications International Corporation
SAIC  NATDP also created bibliographic records for access  NATDP did
not have such specialized equipment as a microfilm scanner

Unfortunately the process of scanning from microfilm was not an
unqualified success ZIDAR reported  because microfilm frame sizes vary
occasionally some frames were missed which without spending much time
and money could not be recaptured

OCR could not be performed from the scanned images of the frames  The
bleeding in the text simply output text when OCR was run that could not
even be edited  NATDP tested for negative versus positive images
landscape versus portrait orientation and single versus dualpage
microfilm none of which seemed to affect the quality of the image but
also on none of them could OCR be performed

In selecting the microfilm they would use therefore NATDP had other
factors in mind  ZIDAR noted two factors that influenced the quality of
the images   the inherent quality of the original and  the amount of
size reduction on the pages

The Carver papers were selected because they are informative and visually
interesting treat a single subject and are valuable in their own right
The images were scanned and divided into logical records by SAIC then
delivered and loaded onto NATDPs system where bibliographic
information taken directly from the images was added  Scanning was
completed in summer  and by the end of summer  the disk was
scheduled to be published

Problems encountered during processing included the following  Because
the microfilm scanning had to be done in a batch adjustment for
individual page variations was not possible  The frame size varied on
account of the nature of the material and therefore some of the frames
were missed while others were just partial frames  The only way to go
back and capture this material was to print out the page with the
microfilm reader from the missing frame and then scan it in from the
page which was extremely timeconsuming  The quality of the images
scanned from the printout of the microfilm compared unfavorably with that
of the original images captured directly from the microfilm  The
inability to perform OCR also was a major disappointment  At the time
computer output microfilm was unavailable to test

The equipment used for a scanning system was the last topic addressed by
ZIDAR  The type of equipment that one would purchase for a scanning
system included  a microcomputer at least a  but preferably a 
a large hard disk  megabyte at minimum a multitasking operating
system that allows one to run some things in batch in the background
while scanning or doing text editing for example Unix or OS and
theoretically Windows a highspeed scanner and scanning software that
allows one to make the various adjustments mentioned earlier a
highresolution monitor  dpi  OCR software and hardware to perform
text recognition an optical disk subsystem on which to archive all the
images as the processing is done file management and tracking software

ZIDAR opined that the software one purchases was more important than the
hardware and might also cost more than the hardware but it was likely to
prove critical to the success or failure of ones system  In addition to
a standalone scanning workstation for image capture then text capture
requires one or two editing stations networked to this scanning station
to perform editing  Editing the text takes two or three times as long as
capturing the images

Finally ZIDAR stressed the importance of buying an open system that allows
for more than one vendor complies with standards and can be upgraded
