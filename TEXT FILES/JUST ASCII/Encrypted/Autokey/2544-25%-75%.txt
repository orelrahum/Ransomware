Note
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June  ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Sinai and the Golan
    Heights As stated in the  Camp David accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bushs post  Gulf crisis peace initiative the final status of
    the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors
    and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined In the US view the term West Bank describes all
    of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before
    the  ArabIsraeli war With respect to negotiations envisaged in the
    framework agreement however it is US policy that a distinction must be
    made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys
    special status and circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for the
    final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the
    rest of the West Bank
    The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military authorities and
    Israeli civil administratAHE IM QG HA IWDCUN HSIV RAL FBGHP XBNTFK HF MBW
