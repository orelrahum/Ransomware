  Pepper mostly said the cook

  Treacle said a sleepy voice behind her

  Collar that Dormouse the Queen shrieked out  Behead that
Dormouse  Turn that Dormouse out of court  Suppress him  Pinch
him  Off with his whiskers

  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the
Dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down
again the cook had disappeared

  Never mind said the King with an air of great relief
Call the next witness  And he added in an undertone to the
Queen Really my dear YOU must crossexamine the next witness
It quite makes my forehead ache

  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like
for they havent got much evidence YET she said to herself
Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out at the top
of his shrill little voice the name Alice



                           CHAPTER XII

                        Alices Evidence


  Here cried Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with
the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
the week before

  Oh I BEG your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
and put back into the jurybox or they would die

  The trial cannot proceed said the King in a very grave
voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places
ALL he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at Alice as
he said do

  Alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she
had put the Lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable
to move  She soon got it out again and put it right not that
it signifies much she said to herself I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other

  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write
out a history of the accident all except the Lizard who seemed
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open
gazing up into the roof of the court

  What do you know about this business? the King said to
Alice

  Nothing said Alice

  Nothing WHATEVER? persisted the King

  Nothing whatever said Alice

  Thats very important the King said turning to the jury
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates when
the White Rabbit interrupted  UNimportant your Majesty means
of course he said in a very respCTXXJP VHSY MNH SVPQGNEU WAL
