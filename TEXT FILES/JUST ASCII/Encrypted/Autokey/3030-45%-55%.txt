angrily

  It wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being
invited said the March Hare

  I didnt know it was YOUR table said Alice its laid for a
great many more than three

  Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter  He had been
looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity and this was
his first speech

  You should learn not to make personal remarks Alice said
with some severity its very rude

  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all
he SAID was Why is a raven like a writingdesk?

  Come we shall have some fun now thought Alice  Im glad
theyve begun asking riddlesI believe I can guess that she
added aloud

  Do you mean that you think you can find out the answer to it?
said the March Hare

  Exactly so said Alice

  Then you should say what you mean the March Hare went on

  I do Alice hastily replied at leastat least I mean what
I saythats the same thing you know

  Not the same thing a bit said the Hatter  You might just
as well say that "I see what I eat" is the same thing as "I eat
what I see"

  You might just as well say added the March Hare that "I
like what I get" is the same thing as "I get what I like"

  You might just as well say added the Dormouse who seemed to
be talking in his sleep that "I breathe when I sleep" is the
same thing as "I sleep when I breathe"

  It IS the same thing with you said the Hatter and here the
conversation dropped and the party sat silent for a minute
while Alice thought over all she could remember about ravens and
writingdesks which wasnt much

  The Hatter was the first to break the silence  What day of
the month is it? he said turning to Alice  he had taken his
watch out of his pocket and was looking at it uneasily shaking
it every now and then and holding it to his ear

  Alice considered a little and then said The fourth

  Two days wrong sighed the Hatter  I told you butter
wouldnt suit the works he added looking angrily at the March
Hare

  It was the BEST butter the March Hare meekly replied

  Yes but some crumbs must have got in as well the Hatter
grumbled  you shouldnt have put it in with the breadknife

  The March Hare took the watch and looked at it gloomily  then
he dipped it into his cup of tea and looked at it again  but he
could think of nothing better to say than his first remark It
was the BEST butter you know

  Alice had been looking over his shoulder with some curiosity
What a funny watch she remarked  It tells the day of the
month and doesnt tell what oclock it is

  Why should it? muttered the Hatter  Does YOUR watch tell
you what year it is?

  Of course not Alice replied very readily  but thats
because it stays the same year for such a long time together

  Which is just the casL AKTZ QEVX ZMQQ XZE PDMAIY
