Ethiopia Economy

Overview
    Ethiopia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in Africa Its
    economy is based on subsistence agriculture which accounts for about  of
    GDP  of exports and  of total employment coffee generates  of
    export earnings The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
    from the agricultural sector Over  of largescale industry but less
    than  of agriculture is state run the government is considering selling
    off a portion of stateowned plants Favorable agricultural weather largely
    explains the  growth in output in FY whereas drought and
    deteriorating internal security conditions prevented growth in FY In 
    the lack of law and order particularly in the south interfered with
    economic development and growth

Falkland Islands Islas Malvinas Economy

Overview
    The economy is based on sheep farming which directly or indirectly employs
    most of the work force A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic
    consumption of milk and milk products and crops grown are primarily those
    for providing winter fodder Exports feature shipments of highgrade wool to
    the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins Rich stocks of fish in the
    surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders So far
    efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful In
     the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
    operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone These license fees
    amount to more than  million per year and are a primary source of income
    for the government To encourage tourism the Falkland Islands Development
    Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant
    wildlife and trout fishing

Faroe Islands Economy

Overview
    The Faroese who have long been enjoying the affluent living standards of
    the Danes and other Scandinavians now must cope with the decline of the
    allimportant fishing industry and with an external debt twice the size of
    annual income When the nations of the world extended their fishing zones to
     nautical miles in the early s the Faroese no longer could continue
    their traditional longdistance fishing and subsequently depleted their own
    nearby fishing areas The governments tight controls on fish stocks and its
    austerity measures have caused a recession and subsidy cuts will force
    further reductions in the fishing industry which has already been plagued
    with bankrupcies An annual Danish subsidy of  million continues to
    provide roughly onethird of the islands budget revenues

Fiji Economy

Overview
    Fijis economy is primarily agricultural with a large subsistence sector
    Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange and sugar processing
    accounts for onethird of industrial output Industry including sugar
    milling contributes  to GDP Fiji traditionally had earned considerable
    sums of hard currency from the  tourists who visited each year In
     however after two military coups the economy went into decline GDP
    dropped by  in  and by another  in  political uncertainty
    created a drop in tourism and the worst drought of the century caused sugar
    production to fall sharply In contrast sugar and tourism turned in strong
    performances in  and the economy rebounded vigorously In  the
    economy received a setback from cyclone Sina which cut sugar output by an
