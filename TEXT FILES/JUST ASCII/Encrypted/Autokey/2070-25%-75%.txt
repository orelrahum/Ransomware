       Conversion of paper or microfilm archives to electronic format
       Conversion of electronic files to formats tailored to
          electronic retrieval and display
       Primary electronic publishing materials for which the
          electronic version is the primary format

OCLC has experimental or product development activities in each of these
areas  Among the challenges that lie ahead is the integration of these
three types of information stores in coherent distributed systems

The CORE Chemistry Online Retrieval Experiment Project is a model for
the conversion of large text and graphics collections for which
electronic typesetting files are available category   The American
Chemical Society has made available computer typography files dating from
 for its twenty journals  This collection of some  journalyears
is being converted to an electronic format that will be accessible
through several enduser applications

The use of Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML offers the means
to capture the structural richness of the original articles in a way that
will support a variety of retrieval navigation and display options
necessary to navigate effectively in very large text databases

An SGML document consists of text that is marked up with descriptive tags
that specify the function of a given element within the document  As a
formal language construct an SGML document can be parsed against a
documenttype definition DTD that unambiguously defines what elements
are allowed and where in the document they can or must occur  This
formalized map of article structure allows the user interface design to
be uncoupled from the underlying database system an important step
toward interoperability  Demonstration of this separability is a part of
the CORE project wherein user interface designs born of very different
philosophies will access the same database

NOTES
       The CORE project is a collaboration among Cornell Universitys
     Mann Library Bell Communications Research Bellcore the American
     Chemical Society ACS the Chemical Abstracts Service CAS and
     OCLC

A major online file of chemical journal literature complete with
graphics is being developed to test the usability of fully electronic
access to documents as a joint project of Cornell University the
American Chemical Society the Chemical Abstracts Service OCLC and
Bellcore with additional support from Sun Microsystems SpringerVerlag
DigitaI Equipment Corporation Sony Corporation of America and Apple
Computers  Our file contains the American Chemical Societys online
journals supplemented with the graphics from the paper publication  The
indexing of the articles from Chemical Abstracts Documents is available
in both image and text format and several different interfaces can be
used  Our goals are  to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of
electronic access to primary journals as compared with paper and  to
identify the most desirable functions of the user interface to an
electronic system of journals including in particular a comparison of
pageimage display with ASCII display interfaces  Early experiments with
chemistry students on a variety of tasks suggest that searching tasks are
completed much faster with any electronic system than with paper but
that for reading all versions of the articles are roughly equivalent

Pamela ANDRE and Judith ZIDAR

Text conversion is far more expensive and timeconsuming than image
capture alone  NALs experience with optical character recognition OCR
will be related and compared with the experience of having text rekeyed
What factors affect OCR accuracy?  How accurate does full text have to be
in order to be useful?  How do different users react to imperfect text?
These are questions that will be explored  For many a service bureau
may be a better solution than performing the work inhouse this will also
be discussed

Copyright law protects creative works  Protection granted by the law to
authors and disseminators of works includes the right to do or authorize
the following  reproduce the work prepare derivative works distribute
the work to the public and publicly perform or display the work  In
addition copyright owners of sound recordings and computer programs have
the right to control rental of their works  These rights are not
unlimited there are a number of exceptions and limitations

An electronic environment places strains on the copyright system
Copyright owners want to control uses of their work and be paid for any
use the public wants quick and easy access at little or no cost  The
marketplace is working in this area  Contracts guidelines on electronic
use and collective licensing are in use and being refined

Issues concerning the ability to change works without detection are more
difficult to deal with  Questions concerning the integrity of the work
and the status of the changed version under the copyright law are to be
addressed  These are public policy issues which require informed
dialogue
