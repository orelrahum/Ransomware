the radio more frequently than the little guy who has to do much more
until he becomes a big guy  That is true of every author every
composer everyone and unfortunately is part of life

Copyright always originates with the author except in cases of works
made for hire  Most software falls into this category  When an author
sends his article to a journal he has not relinquished copyright though
he retains the right to relinquish it  The author receives absolutely
everything  The less prominent the author the more leverage the
publisher will have in contract negotiations  In order to transfer the
rights the author must sign an agreement giving them away

In an electronic society it is important to be able to license a writer
and work out deals  With regard to use of a work it usually is much
easier when a publisher holds the rights  In an electronic era a real
problem arises when one is digitizing and making information available
PETERS referred again to electronic licensing clearinghouses  Copyright
ought to remain with the author but as one moves forward globally in the
electronic arena a middleman who can handle the various rights becomes
increasingly necessary

The notion of copyright law is that it resides with the individual but
in an online environment where a work can be adapted and tinkered with
by many individuals there is concern  If changes are authorized and
there is no agreement to the contrary the person who changes a work owns
the changes  To put it another way the person who acquires permission
to change a work technically will become the author and the owner unless
some agreement to the contrary has been made  It is typical for the
original publisher to try to control all of the versions and all of the
uses  Copyright law always only sets up the boundaries  Anything can be
changed by contract

                                 

SESSION VII  CONCLUSION


GENERAL DISCUSSION  Two questions for discussion  Different emphases in
the Workshop  Bringing the text and image partisans together 
Desiderata in planning the longterm development of something  Questions
surrounding the issue of electronic deposit  Discussion of electronic
deposit as an allusion to the issue of standards  Need for a directory
of preservation projects in digital form and for access to their
digitized files  CETHs catalogue of machinereadable texts in the
humanities  What constitutes a publication in the electronic world? 
Need for LC to deal with the concept of online publishing  LCs Network
Development Office  exploring the limits of MARC as a standard in terms
of handling electronic information  Magnitude of the problem and the
need for distributed responsibility in order to maintain and store
electronic information  Workshop participants to be viewed as a starting
point  Development of a network version of AM urged  A step toward AMs
construction of some sort of apparatus for network access  A delicate
and agonizing policy question for LC  Re the issue of electronic
deposit LC urged to initiate a catalytic process in terms of distributed
responsibility  Suggestions for cooperative ventures  Commercial
publishers fears  Strategic questions for getting the image and text
people to think through longterm cooperation  Clarification of the
driving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects 


In his role as moderator of the concluding session GIFFORD raised two
questions he believed would benefit from discussion   Are there enough
commonalities among those of us that have been here for two days so that
we can see courses of action that should be taken in the future?  And if
so what are they and who might take them?   Partly derivative from
that but obviously very dangerous to LC as host do you see a role for
the Library of Congress in all this?  Of course the Library of Congress
holds a rather special status in a number of these matters because it is
not perceived as a player with an economic stake in them but are there
roles that LC can play that can help advance us toward where we are heading?

Describing himself as an uninformed observer of the technicalities of the
last two days GIFFORD detected three different emphases in the Workshop
 people who are very deeply committed to text  people who are almost
passionate about images and  a few people who are very committed to
what happens to the networks  In other words the new networking
dimension the accessibility of the processability the portability of
all this across the networks  How do we pull those three together?

Adding a question that reflected HOCKEYs comment that this was the
fourth workshop she had attended in the previous thirty days FLEISCHHAUER
wondered to what extent this meeting had reinvented the wheel or if it
had contributed anything in the way of bringing together a different group
of people from those who normally appear on the workshop circuit

HOCKEY confessed to being struck at this meeting and the one the
Electronic Pierce Consortium organized the previous week that this was a
coming together of people working on texts and not images  Attempting to
bring the two together is something we ought to be thinking about for the
future  How one can think about working with image material to begin
with but structuring it and digitizing it in such a way that at a later
stage it can be interpreted into text and find a common way of building
text and images together so that they can be used jointly in the future
with the network support to begin there because that is how people will
want to access it

In planning the longterm development of something which is what is
being done in electronic text HOCKEY stressed the importance not only
of discussing the technical aspects of how one does it but particularly
of thinking about what the people who use the stuff will want to do
But conversely there are numerous things that people start to do with
electronic text or material that nobody ever thought of in the beginning

LESK in response to the question concerning the role of the Library of
Congress remarked the often suggested desideratum of having electronic
deposit  Since everything is now computertypeset an entire decade of
material that was machinereadable exists but the publishers frequently
did not save it has LC taken any action to have its copyright deposit
operation start collecting these machinereadable versions?  In the
absence of PETERS GIFFORD replied that the question was being
actively considered but that that was only one dimension of the problem
Another dimension is the whole question of the integrity of the original
electronic document  It becomes highly important in science to prove
authorship  How will that be done?

ERWAY explained that under the old policy to make a claim for a
copyright for works that were published in electronic form including
software one had to submit a paper copy of the first and last twenty
pages of codesomething that represented the work but did not include
the entire work itself and had little value to anyone  As a temporary
measure LC has claimed the right to demand electronic versions of
electronic publications  This measure entails a proactive role for the
Library to say that it wants a particular electronic version  Publishers
then have perhaps a year to submit it  But the real problem for LC is
what to do with all this material in all these different formats  Will
the Library mount it?  How will it give people access to it?  How does LC
keep track of the appropriate computers software and media?  The situation
is so hard to control ERWAY said that it makes sense for each publishing
house to maintain its own archive  But LC cannot enforce that either

GIFFORD acknowledged LESKs suggestion that establishing a priority
offered the solution albeit a fairly complicated one  But who maintains
that register? he asked  GRABER noted that LC does attempt to collect a
Macintosh version and the IBMcompatible version of software  It does
not collect other versions  But while true for software BYRUM observed
this reply does not speak to materials that is all the materials that
were published that were on somebodys microcomputer or driver tapes
at a publishing office across the country  LC does well to acquire
specific machinereadable products selectively that were intended to be
machinereadable  Materials that were in machinereadable form at one time
BYRUM said would be beyond LCs capability at the moment insofar as
attempting to acquire organize and preserve them are concernedand
preservation would be the most important consideration  In this
connection GIFFORD reiterated the need to work out some sense of
distributive responsibility for a number of these issues which
inevitably will require significant cooperation and discussion
Nobody can do it all

LESK suggested that some publishers may look with favor on LC beginning
to serve as a depository of tapes in an electronic manuscript standard
Publishers may view this as a service that they did not have to perform
and they might send in tapes  However SPERBERGMcQUEEN countered
although publishers have had equivalent services available to them for a
long time the electronic text archive has never turned away or been
flooded with tapes and is forever sending feedback to the depositor
Some publishers do send in tapes

ANDRE viewed this discussion as an allusion to the issue of standards
She recommended that the AAP standard and the TEI which has already been
somewhat harmonized internationally and which also shares several
compatibilities with the AAP be harmonized to ensure sufficient
compatibility in the software  She drew the line at saying LC ought to
be the locus or forum for such harmonization

Taking the group in a slightly different direction but one where at
least in the near term LC might play a helpful role LYNCH remarked the
plans of a number of projects to carry out preservation by creating
digital images that will end up in online or nearline storage at some
institution   Presumably LC will link this material somehow to its
online catalog in most cases  Thus it is in a digital form  LYNCH had
the impression that many of these institutions would be willing to make
those files accessible to other people outside the institution provided
that there is no copyright problem  This desideratum will require
propagating the knowledge that those digitized files exist so that they
can end up in other online catalogs  Although uncertain about the
mechanism for achieving this result LYNCH said that it warranted
scrutiny because it seemed to be connected to some of the basic issues of
cataloging and distribution of records  It would be  foolish given the
amount of work that all of us have to do and our meager resources to
discover multiple institutions digitizing the same work  Re microforms
LYNCH said we are in pretty good shape

BATTIN called this a big problem and noted that the Cornell people who
had already departed were working on it  At issue from the beginning
was to learn how to catalog that information into RLIN and then into
OCLC so that it would be accessible  That issue remains to be resolved
LYNCH rejoined that putting it into OCLC or RLIN was helpful insofar as
somebody who is thinking of performing preservation activity on that work
could learn about it  It is not necessarily helpful for institutions to
make that available  BATTIN opined that the idea was that it not only be
for preservation purposes but for the convenience of people looking for
this material  She endorsed LYNCHs dictum that duplication of this
effort was to be avoided by every means

HOCKEY informed the Workshop about one major current activity of CETH
namely a catalogue of machinereadable texts in the humanities  Held on
RLIN at present the catalogue has been concentrated on ASCII as opposed
to digitized images of text  She is exploring ways to improve the
catalogue and make it more widely available and welcomed suggestions
about these concerns  CETH owns the records which are not just
restricted to RLIN and can distribute them however it wishes

Taking up LESKs earlier question BATTIN inquired whether LC since it
is accepting electronic files and designing a mechanism for dealing with
that rather than putting books on shelves would become responsible for
the National Copyright Depository of Electronic Materials  Of course
that could not be accomplished overnight but it would be something LC
could plan for  GIFFORD acknowledged that much thought was being devoted
to that set of problems and returned the discussion to the issue raised
by LYNCHwhether or not putting the kind of records that both BATTIN and
HOCKEY have been talking about in RLIN is not a satisfactory solution
It seemed to him that RLIN answered LYNCHs original point concerning
some kind of directory for these kinds of materials  In a situation
where somebody is attempting to decide whether or not to scan this or
film that or to learn whether or not someone has alreadJ USNH QR ZLRUV
