BATTIN offered a primer on how to move forward with reasonable confidence
in a world without standards  Her comments fell roughly into two sections
 standards in the real world and  the politics of reproduction

In regard to realworld standards BATTIN argued the need to redefine the
concept of archive and to begin to think in terms of life cycles  In
the past the naive assumption that paper would last forever produced a
cavalier attitude toward life cycles  The transient nature of the
electronic media has compelled people to recognize and accept upfront the
concept of life cycles in place of permanency

Digital standards have to be developed and set in a cooperative context
to ensure efficient exchange of information  Moreover during this
transition period greater flexibility concerning how concepts such as
backup copies and archival copies in the CXP are defined is necessary
or the opportunity to move forward will be lost

In terms of cooperation particularly in the university setting BATTIN
also argued the need to avoid going off in a hundred different
directions  The CPA has catalyzed a small group of universities called
the La Guardia Eightbecause La Guardia Airport is where meetings take
placeHarvard Yale Cornell Princeton Penn State Tennessee
Stanford and USC to develop a digital preservation consortium to look
at all these issues and develop de facto standards as we move along
instead of waiting for something that is officially blessed  Continuing
to apply analog values and definitions of standards to the digital
environment BATTIN said will effectively lead to forfeiture of the
benefits of digital technology to research and scholarship

Under the second rubric the politics of reproduction BATTIN reiterated
an oftmade argument concerning the electronic library namely that it
is more difficult to transform than to create and nowhere is that belief
expressed more dramatically than in the conversion of brittle books to
new media  Preserving information published in electronic media involves
making sure the information remains accessible and that digital
information is not lost through reproduction  In the analog world of
photocopies and microfilm the issue of fidelity to the original becomes
paramount as do issues of "Whose fidelity?" and "Whose original?"

BATTIN elaborated these arguments with a few examples from a recent study
conducted by the CPA on the problems of preserving text and image
Discussions with scholars librarians and curators in a variety of
disciplines dependent on text and image generated a variety of concerns
for example   Copy what is not what the technology is capable of
This is very important for the history of ideas  Scholars wish to know
what the author saw and worked from  And make available at the
workstation the opportunity to erase all the defects and enhance the
presentation   The fidelity of reproductionwhat is good enough what
can we afford and the difference it makesissues of subjective versus
objective resolution   The differences between primary and secondary
users  Restricting the definition of primary user to the one in whose
discipline the material has been published runs one headlong into the
reality that these printed books have had a host of other users from a
host of other disciplines who not only were looking for very different
things but who also shared values very different from those of the
primary user   The relationship of the standard of reproduction to new
capabilities of scholarshipthe browsing standard versus an archival
standard  How good must the archival standard be?  Can a distinction be
drawn between potential users in setting standards for reproduction?
Archival storage use copies browsing copiesought an attempt to set
standards even be made?   Finally costs  How much are we prepared to
pay to capture absolute fidelity?  What are the tradeoffs between vastly
enhanced access degrees of fidelity and costs?

These standards BATTIN concluded serve to complicate further the
reproduction process and add to the long list of technical standards
that are necessary to ensure widespread access  Ways to articulate and
analyze the costs that are attached to the different levels of standards
must be found

Given the chaos concerning standards which promises to linger for the
foreseeable future BATTIN urged adoption of the following general
principles

      Strive to understand the changing information requirements of
     scholarly disciplines as more and more technology is integrated into
     the process of research and scholarly communication in order to meet
     future scholarly needs not to build for the past  Capture
     deteriorating information at the highest affordable resolution even
     though the dissemination and display technologies will lag

      Develop cooperative mechanisms to foster agreement on protocols
     for document structure and other interchange mechanisms necessary
     for widespread dissemination and use before official standards are
     set

      Accept that in a transition period de facto standards will have
     to be developed

      Capture information in a way that keeps all options open and
     provides for total convertibility  OCR scanning of microfilm
     producing microfilm from scanned documents etc

      Work closely with the generators of information and the builders
     of networks and databases to ensure that continuing accessibility is
     a primary concern from the beginning

      Piggyback on standards under development for the broad market and
     avoid libraryspecific standards work with the vendors in order to
     take advantage of that which is being standardized for the rest of
     the world

      Concentrate efforts on managing permanence in the digital world
     rather than perfecting the longevity of a particular medium

                                 


DISCUSSION  Additional comments on TIFF 


During the brief discussion period that followed BATTINs presentation
BARONAS explained that TIFF was not developed in collaboration with or
under the auspices of AIIM  TIFF is a company product not a standard
is owned by two corporations and is always changing  BARONAS also
observed that ANSIAIIM MS a bilevel image file transfer format that
allows unlike systems to exchange images is compatible with TIFF as well
as with DECs architecture and IBMs MODCAIOCA

                                 


HOOTON  Several questions to be considered in discussing text conversion



HOOTON introduced the final topic text conversion by noting that it is
becoming an increasingly important part of the imaging business  Many
people now realize that it enhances their system to be able to have more
and more character data as part of their imaging system  Re the issue of
OCR versus rekeying HOOTON posed several questions  How does one get
text into computerreadable form?  Does one use automated processes?
Does one attempt to eliminate the use of operators where possible?
