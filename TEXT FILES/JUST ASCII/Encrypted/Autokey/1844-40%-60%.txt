    source of economic and military aid To earn needed foreign exchange Israel
    has been targeting hightechnology niches in international markets such as
    medical scanning equipment Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in August  dealt a
    blow to Israels economy Higher world oil prices added an estimated 
    million to the oil import bill that year and helped keep annual inflation at
     Regional tension and the continuing Palestinian uprising intifadah
    have contributed to a sharp drop in tourism  a key foreign exchange earner
