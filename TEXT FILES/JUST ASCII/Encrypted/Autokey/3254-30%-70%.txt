Overview
    Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
    economies most industrial plants being owned by the government
    Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment
    Even so the economy grew rapidly during the late s and early s but
    in  the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
    debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
    balanceofpayments support As part of the  agreement with the IMF the
    government agreed to institute a reform program to reduce inflation promote
    economic growth and improve its external position The reforms have been
    slow in coming however and the economy has been largely stagnant for the
    past four years The addition of  million people every seven months to
    Egypts population exerts enormous pressure on the  of the total land area
    available for agriculture
