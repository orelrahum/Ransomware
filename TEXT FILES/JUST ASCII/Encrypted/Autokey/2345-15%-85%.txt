ACT I



SCENE II	Lawn before the Dukes palace


	Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

CELIA	I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry

ROSALIND	Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of
	and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
	teach me to forget a banished father you must not
	learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure

CELIA	Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
	that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father
	had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou
	hadst been still with me I could have taught my
	love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou
	if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
	tempered as mine is to thee

ROSALIND	Well I will forget the condition of my estate to
	rejoice in yours

CELIA	You know my father hath no child but I nor none is
	like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt
	be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy
	father perforce I will render thee again in
	affection by mine honour I will and when I break
	that oath let me turn monster therefore my
	sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry

ROSALIND	From henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let
	me see what think you of falling in love?

CELIA	Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but
	love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport
	neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
	in honour come off again

ROSALIND	What shall be our sport then?

CELIA	Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
	her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally

ROSALIND	I would we could do so for her benefits are
	mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman
	doth most mistake in her gifts to women

CELIA	Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce
	makes honest and those that she makes honest she
	makes very illfavouredly

ROSALIND	Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to
	Natures Fortune reigns in gifts of the world
	not in the lineaments of Nature

	Enter TOUCHSTONE

CELIA	No? when Nature hath made a fair creature may she
	not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
	hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not
	Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?

ROSALIND	Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when
	Fortune makes Natures natural the cutteroff of
	Natures wit

CELIA	Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither but
	Natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
	to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
	natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of
	the fool is the whetstone of the wits How now
	wit whither wander you?

TOUCHSTONE	Mistress you must come away to your father

CELIA	Were you made the messenger?

TOUCHSTONE	No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you

ROSALIND	Where learned you that oath fool?

TOUCHSTONE	Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
	were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
	mustard was naught now Ill stand to it the
	pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and
	yet was not the knight forsworn

CELIA	How prove you that in the great heap of your
	knowledge?

ROSALIND	Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom

TOUCHSTONE	Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and
	swear by your beards that I am a knave

CELIA	By our beards if we had them thou art

TOUCHSTONE	By my knavery if I had it then I were but if you
	swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no
	more was this knight swearing by his honour for he
	never had any or if he had he had sworn it away
	before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard

CELIA	Prithee who ist that thou meanest?

TOUCHSTONE	One that old Frederick your father loves

CELIA	My fathers love is enough to honour him enough
	speak no more of him youll be whipped for taxation
	one of these days

TOUCHSTONE	The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
	wise men do foolishly

CELIA	By my troth thou sayest true for since the little
	wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery
	that wise men have makes a great show Here comes
	Monsieur Le Beau

ROSALIND	With his mouth full of news

CELIA	Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young

ROSALIND	Then shall we be newscrammed

CELIA	All the better we shall be the more marketable

	Enter LE BEAU

	Bon jour Monsieur Le Beau whats the news?

LE BEAU	Fair princess you have lost much good sport

CELIA	Sport of what colour?

LE BEAU	What colour madam how shall I answer you?

ROSALIND	As wit and fortune will

TOUCHSTONE	Or as the Destinies decree

CELIA	Well said that was laid on with a trowel

TOUCHSTONE	Nay if I keep not my rank

ROSALIND	Thou losest thy old smell

LE BEAU	You amaze me ladies I would have told you of good
	wrestling which you have lost the sight of

ROSALIND	You tell us the manner of the wrestling

LE BEAU	I will tell you the beginning and if it please
	your ladyships you may see the end for the best is
	yet to do and here where you are they are coming
	to perform it

CELIA	Well the beginning that is dead and buried

LE BEAU	There comes an old man and his three sons

CELIA	I could match this beginning with an old tale

LE BEAU	Three proper young men of excellent growth and presence

ROSALIND	With bills on their necks Be it known unto all men
	by these presents

LE BEAU	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the
	dukes wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him
	and broke three of his ribs that there is little
	hope of life in him so he served the second and
	so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man
	their father making such pitiful dole over them
	that all the beholders take his part with weeping

ROSALIND	Alas

TOUCHSTONE	But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies
	have lost?

LE BEAU	Why this that I speak of

TOUCHSTONE	Thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first
	time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
	for ladies

CELIA	Or I I promise thee

ROSALIND	But is there any else longs to see this broken music
	in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
	ribbreaking? Shall we see this wrestling cousin?

LE BEAU	You must if you stay here for here is the place
	appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to
	perform it

CELIA	Yonder sure they are coming let us now stay and see it

	Flourish Enter DUKE FREDERICK Lords ORLANDO
	CHARLES and Attendants

DUKE FREDERICK	Come on since the youth will not be entreated his
	own peril on his forwardness

ROSALIND	Is yonder the man?

LE BEAU	Even he madam

CELIA	Alas he is too young yet he looks successfully

DUKE FREDERICK	How now daughter and cousin are you crept hither
	to see the wrestling?

ROSALIND	Ay my liege so please you give us leave

DUKE FREDERICK	You will take little delight in it I can tell you
	there is such odds in the man In pity of the
	challengers youth I would fain dissuade him but he
	will not be entreated Speak to him ladies see if
	you can move him

CELIA	Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau

DUKE FREDERICK	Do so Ill not be by

LE BEAU	Monsieur the challenger the princesses call for you

ORLANDO	I attend them with all respect and duty

ROSALIND	Young man have you challenged Charles the wrestler?

ORLANDO	No fair princess he is the general challenger I
	come but in as others do to try with him the
	strength of my youth

CELIA	Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your
	years You have seen cruel proof of this mans
	strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or
	knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your
	adventure would counsel you to a more equal
	enterprise We pray you for your own sake to
	embrace your own safety and give over this attempt

ROSALIND	Do young sir your reputation shall not therefore
	be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke
	that the wrestling might not go forward

ORLANDO	I beseech you punish me not with your hard
	thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny
	so fair and excellent ladies any thing But let
	your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
	trial wherein if I be foiled there is but one
	shamed that was never gracious if killed but one
	dead that was willing to be so I shall do my
	friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the
	world no injury for in it I have nothing only in
	the world I fill up a place which may be better
	supplied when I have made it empty

ROSALIND	The little strength that I have I would it were with you

CELIA	And mine to eke out hers

ROSALIND	Fare you well pray heaven I be deceived in you

CELIA	Your hearts desires be with you

CHARLES	Come where is this young gallant that is so
	desirous to lie with his mother earth?

ORLANDO	Ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working

DUKE FREDERICK	You shall try but one fall

CHARLES	No I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him
	to a second that have so mightily persuaded him
	from a first

ORLANDO	An you mean to mock me after you should not have
	mocked me before but come your ways

ROSALIND	Now Hercules be thy speed young man

CELIA	I would I were invisible to catch the strong
	fellow by the leg

	They wrestle

ROSALIND	O excellent young man

CELIA	If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who
	should down

	Shout CHARLES is thrown

DUKE FREDERICK	No more no more

ORLANDO	Yes I beseech your grace I am not yet well breathed

DUKE FREDERICK	How dost thou Charles?

LE BEAU	He cannot speak my lord

DUKE FREDERICK	Bear him away What is thy name young man?

ORLANDO	Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys

DUKE FREDERICK	I would thou hadst been son to some man else
	The world esteemd thy father honourable
	But I did find him still mine enemy
	Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed
	Hadst thou descended from another house
	But fare thee well thou art a gallant youth
	I would thou hadst told me of another father

	Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK train and LE BEAU

CELIA	Were I my father coz would I do this?

ORLANDO	I am more proud to be Sir Rowlands son
	His youngest son and would not change that calling
	To be adopted heir to Frederick

ROSALIND	My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul
	And all the world was of my fathers mind
	Had I before known this young man his son
	I should have given him tears unto entreaties
	Ere he should thus have ventured

CELIA	Gentle cousin
	Let us go thank him and encourage him
	My fathers rough and envious disposition
	Sticks me at heart Sir you have well deserved
	If you do keep your promises in love
	But justly as you have exceeded all promise
	Your mistress shall be happy

ROSALIND	Gentleman

	Giving him a chain from her neck

	Wear this for me one out of suits with fortune
	That could give more but that her hand lacks means
	Shall we go coz?

CELIA	                  Ay Fare you well fair gentleman

ORLANDO	Can I not say I thank you? My better parts
	Are all thrown down and that which here stands up
	Is but a quintain a mere lifeless block

ROSALIND	He calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes
	Ill ask him what he would Did you call sir?
	Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown
	More than your enemies

CELIA	Will you go coz?

ROSALIND	Have with you Fare you well

	Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

ORLANDO	What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
	I cannot speak to her yet she urged conference
	O poor Orlando thou art overthrown
	Or Charles or something weaker masters thee

	Reenter LE BEAU

LE BEAU	Good sir I do in friendship counsel you
	To leave this place Albeit you have deserved
	High commendation true applause and love
	Yet such is now the dukes condition
	That he misconstrues all that you have done
	The duke is humorous what he is indeed
	More suits you to conceive than I to speak of

ORLANDO	I thank you sir and pray you tell me this
	Which of the two was daughter of the duke
	That here was at the wrestling?

LE BEAU	Neither his daughter if we judge by manners
	But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
	The other is daughter to the banishd duke
	And here detaind by her usurping uncle
	To keep his daughter company whose loves
	Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
	But I can tell you that of late this duke
	Hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece
	Grounded upon no other argument
	But that the people praise her for her virtues
	And pity her for her good fathers sake
	And on my life his malice gainst the lady
	Will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well
	Hereafter in a better world than this
	I shall desire more love and knowledge of you

ORLANDO	I rest much bounden to you fare you well

	Exit LE BEAU

	Thus must I from the smoke into the smother
	From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother
	But heavenly Rosalind

	Exit
