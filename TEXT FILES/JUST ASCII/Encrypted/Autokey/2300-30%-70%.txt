    mass back to the ocean
Terrain
    surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise warmwater gyre
    broad circular system of currents and in the southern Pacific by a
    counterclockwise coolwater gyre sea ice occurs in the Bering Sea and Sea
    of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from Antarctica
    in October the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East
    Pacific Rise while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches the
