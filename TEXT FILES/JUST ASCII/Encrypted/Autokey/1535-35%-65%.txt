Raise out of friendship hostile deeds in peace
The conquered also and enslaved by war
Shall with their freedom lost all virtue lose
And fear of God from whom their piety feigned
In sharp contest of battle found no aid
Against invaders therefore cooled in zeal
Thenceforth shall practice how to live secure
Worldly or dissolute on what their lords
Shall leave them to enjoy for the earth shall bear
More than enough that temperance may be tried
So all shall turn degenerate all depraved
Justice and temperance truth and faith forgot
One man except the only son of light
In a dark age against example good
Against allurement custom and a world
Offended fearless of reproach and scorn
The grandchild with twelve sons encreased departs
From Canaan to a land hereafter called
Egypt divided by the river Nile
See where it flows disgorging at seven mouths
Into the sea  To sojourn in that land
He comes invited by a younger son
In time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds
Raise him to be the second in that realm
Of Pharaoh  There he dies and leaves his race
Growing into a nation and now grown
Suspected to a sequent king who seeks
To stop their overgrowth as inmate guests
Or violence he of their wicked ways
Shall them admonish and before them set
The paths of righteousness how much more safe
And full of peace denouncing wrath to come
On their impenitence and shall return
Of them derided but of God observed
The one just man alive by his command
Shall build a wonderous ark as thou beheldst
To save himself and houshold from amidst
A world devote to universal wrack
No sooner he with them of man and beast
Select for life shall in the ark be lodged
And sheltered round but all the cataracts
Of Heaven set open on the Earth shall pour
Rain day and night all fountains of the deep
Broke up shall heave the ocean to usurp
Beyond all bounds till inundation rise
Above the highest hills  Then shall this mount
Of Paradise by might of waves be moved
Out of his place pushed by the horned flood
With all his verdure spoiled and trees adrift
Down the great river to the opening gulf
And there take root an island salt and bare
The haunt of seals and orcs and seamews clang
To teach thee that God attributes to place
No sanctity if none be thither brought
By men who there frequent or therein dwell
And now what further shall ensue behold
He looked and saw the ark hull on the flood
Which now abated for the clouds were fled
Driven by a keen northwind that blowing dry
Wrinkled the face of deluge as decayed
And the clear sun on his wide watery glass
Gazed hot and of the fresh wave largely drew
As after thirst which made their flowing shrink
From standing lake to tripping ebb that stole
With soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt
His sluces as the Heaven his windows shut
The ark no more now floats but seems on ground
Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed
And now the tops of hills as rocks appear
With clamour thence the rapid currents drive
Towards the retreating sea their furious tide
Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies
And after him the surer messenger
A dove sent forth once and again to spy
Green tree or ground whereon his foot may light
The second time returning in his bill
An oliveleaf he brings pacifick sign
Anon dry ground appears and from his ark
The ancient sire descends with all his train
Then with uplifted hands and eyes devout
Grateful to Heaven over his head beholds
A dewy cloud and in the cloud a bow
Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay
Betokening peace from God and covenant new
Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad
Greatly rejoiced and thus his joy broke forth
O thou who future things canst represent
As present heavenly Instructer  I revive
At this last sight assured that Man shall live
With all the creatures and their seed preserve
Far less I now lament for one whole world
Of wicked sons destroyed than I rejoice
For one man found so perfect and so just
That God vouchsafes to raise another world
From him and all his anger to forget
But say what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven
Distended as the brow of God appeased?
Or serve they as a flowery verge to bind
The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud
Lest it again dissolve and shower the earth?
To whom the ArchAngel  Dextrously thou aimest
So willingly doth God remit his ire
Though late repenting him of Man depraved
Grieved at his heart when looking down he saw
The whole earth filled with violence and all flesh
Corrupting each their way yet those removed
Such grace shall one just man find in his sight
That he relents not to blot out mankind
And makes a covenant never to destroy
The earth again by flood nor let the sea
Surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world
With man therein or beast but when he brings
Over the earth a cloud will therein set
His triplecoloured bow whereon to look
And call to mind his covenant Day and night
Seedtime and harvest heat and hoary frost
Shall hold their course till fire purge all things new
Both Heaven and Earth wherein the just shall dwell



Book XII


As one who in his journey bates at noon
Though bent on speed so here the ArchAngel paused
Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose
Then with transition sweet new speech resumes
Thus thou hast seen one world begin and end
And Man as from a second stock proceed
Much thou hast yet to see but I perceive
Thy mortal sight to fail objects divine
Must needs impair and weary human sense
Henceforth what is to come I will relate
Thou therefore give due audience and attend
This second source of Men while yet but few
And while the dread of judgement past remains
Fresh in their minds fearing the Deity
With some regard to what is just and right
Shall lead their lives and multiply apace
Labouring the soil and reaping plenteous crop
Corn wine and oil and from the herd or flock
Oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid
With large wineofferings poured and sacred feast
Shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell
Long time in peace by families and tribes
Under paternal rule till one shall rise
Of proud ambitious heart who not content
With fair equality fraternal state
Will arrogate dominion undeserved
Over his brethren and quite dispossess
Concord and law of nature from the earth
Hunting and men not beasts shall be his game
With war and hostile snare such as refuse
Subjection to his empire tyrannous
A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled
Before the Lord as in despite of Heaven
Or from Heaven claiming second sovranty
And from rebellion shall derive his name
Though of rebellion others he accuse
He with a crew whom like ambition joins
With him or under him to tyrannize
Marching from Eden towards the west shall find
The plain wherein a black bituminous gurge
Boils out from under ground the mouth of Hell
Of brick and of that stuff they cast to build
A city and tower whose top may reach to Heaven
And get themselves a name lest far dispersed
In foreign lands their memory be lost
Regardless whether good or evil fame
But God who oft descends to visit men
Unseen and through their habitations walks
To mark their doings them beholding soon
Comes down to see their city ere the tower
Obstruct Heaventowers and in derision sets
Upon their tongues a various spirit to rase
Quite out their native language and instead
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
Among the builders each to other calls
Not understood till hoarse and all in rage
As mocked they storm great laughter was in Heaven
And looking down to see the hubbub strange
And hear the din  Thus was the building left
Ridiculous and the work Confusion named
Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeased
O execrable son so to aspire
Above his brethren to himself assuming
Authority usurped from God not given
He gave us only over beast fish fowl
Dominion absolute that right we hold
By his donation but man over men
He made not lord such title to himself
Reserving human left from human free
But this usurper his encroachment proud
Stays not on Man to God his tower intends
Siege and defiance  Wretched manwhat food
Will he convey up thither to sustain
Himself and his rash army where thin air
Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross
And famish him of breath if not of bread?
To whom thus Michael  Justly thou abhorrest
That son who on the quiet state of men
Such trouble brought affecting to subdue
Rational liberty yet know withal
Since thy original lapse true liberty
Is lost which always with right reason dwells
Twinned and from her hath no dividual being
Reason in man obscured or not obeyed
Immediately inordinate desires
And upstart passions catch the government
From reason and to servitude reduce
Man till then free  Therefore since he permits
Within himself unworthy powers to reign
Over free reason God in judgement just
Subjects him from without to violent lords
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
His outward freedom  Tyranny must be
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low
From virtue which is reason that no wrong
But justice and some fatal curse annexed
Deprives them of their outward liberty
Their inward lost  Witness the irreverent son
Of him who built the ark who for the shame
Done to his father heard this heavy curse
Servant of servants on his vicious race
Thus will this latter as the former world
Still tend from bad to worse till God at last
Wearied with their iniquities withdraw
His presence from among them and avert
His holy eyes resolving from thenceforth
To leave them to their own polluted ways
And one peculiar nation to select
From all the rest of whom to be invoked
A nation from one faithful man to spring
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing
Bred up in idolworship  O that men
Canst thou believe? should be so stupid grown
While yet the patriarch lived who scaped the flood
As to forsake the living God and fall
To worship their own work in wood and stone
For Gods  Yet him KHK BTK ARLA LUUZ OVCIONOZGZ
