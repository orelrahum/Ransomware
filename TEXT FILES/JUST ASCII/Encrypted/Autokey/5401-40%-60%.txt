PHEBE	I would not be thy executioner
	I fly thee for I would not injure thee
	Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye
	Tis pretty sure and very probable
	That eyes that are the frailst and softest things
	Who shut their coward gates on atomies
	Should be calld tyrants butchers murderers
	Now I do frown on thee with all my heart
	And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
	Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
	Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame
	Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
	Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
	Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
	Some scar of it lean but upon a rush
	The cicatrice and capable impressure
	Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
	Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not
	Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
	That can do hurt

SILVIUS	                  O dear Phebe
	If everas that ever may be near
	You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
	Then shall you know the wounds invisible
	That loves keen arrows make

PHEBE	But till that time
	Come not thou near me and when that time comes
	Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
	As till that time I shall not pity thee

ROSALIND	And why I pray you? Who might be your mother
	That you insult exult and all at once
	Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty
	As by my faith I see no more in you
	Than without candle may go dark to bed
	Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
	Why what means this? Why do you look on me?
	I see no more in you than in the ordinary
	Of natures salework Ods my little life
	I think she means to tangle my eyes too
	No faith proud mistress hope not after it
	Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
	Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
	That can entame my spirits to your worship
	You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
	Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
	You are a thousand times a properer man
	Than she a woman tis such fools as you
	That makes the world full of illfavourd children
	Tis not her glass but you that flatters her
	And out of you she sees herself more proper
	Than any of her lineaments can show her
	But mistress know yourself down on your knees
	And thank heaven fasting for a good mans love
	For I must tell you friendly in your ear
	Sell when you can you are not for all markets
	Cry the man mercy love him take his offer
	Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
	So take her to thee shepherd fare you well

PHEBE	Sweet youth I pray you chide a year together
	I had rather hear you chide than this man woo

ROSALIND	Hes fallen in love with your foulness and shell
	fall in love with my anger If it be so as fast as
	she answers thee with frowning looks Ill sauce her
	with bitter words Why look you so upon me?

PHEBE	For no ill will I bear you

ROSALIND	I pray you do not fall in love with me
	For I am falser than vows made in wine
	Besides I like you not If you will know my house
	Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
	Will you go sister? Shepherd ply her hard
	Come sister Shepherdess look on him better
	And be not proud though all the world could see
	None could be so abused in sight as he
	Come to our flock

	Exeunt ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN

PHEBE	Dead Shepherd now I find thy saw of might
	Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe

PHEBE	                  Ha what sayst thou Silvius?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe pity me

PHEBE	Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius

SILVIUS	Wherever sorrow is relief would be
	If you do sorrow at my grief in love
	By giving love your sorrow and my grief
	Were both extermined

PHEBE	Thou hast my love is not that neighbourly?

SILVIUS	I would have you

PHEBE	                  Why that were covetousness
	Silvius the time was that I hated thee
	And yet it is not that I bear thee love
	But since that thou canst talk of love so well
	Thy company which erst was irksome to me
	I will endure and Ill employ thee too
	But do not look for further recompense
	Than thine own gladness that thou art employd

SILVIUS	So holy and so perfect is my love
	And I in such a poverty of grace
	That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
	To glean the broken ears after the man
	That the main harvest reaps loose now and then
	A scatterd smile and that Ill live upon

PHEBE	Knowst now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

SILVIUS	Not very well but I have met him oft
	And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
	That the old carlot once was master of

PHEBE	Think not I love him though I ask for him
	Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
	But what care I for words? yet words do well
	When he that speaks them pleases those that hear
	It is a pretty youth not very pretty
	But sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him
	Hell make a proper man the best thing in him
	Is his complexion and faster than his tongue
	Did make offence his eye did heal it up
	He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall
	His leg is but so so and yet tis well
	There was a pretty redness in his lip
	A little riper and more lusty red
	Than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference
	Between the constant red and mingled damask
	There be some women Silvius had they markd him
	In parcels as I did would have gone near
	To fall in love with him but for my part
	I love him not nor hate him not and yet
	I have more cause to hate him than to love him
	For what had he to do to chide at me?
	He said mine eyes were black and my hair black
	And now I am rememberd scornd at me
	I marvel why I answerd not again
	But thats all one omittance is no quittance
	Ill write to him a very taunting letter
	And thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius?

SILVIUS	Phebe with all my heart

PHEBE	Ill write it straight
	The matters in my head and in my heart
	I will be bitter with him and passing short
	Go with me Silvius

	Exeunt

ACT IV



SCENE I	The forest


	Enter ROSALIND CELIA and JAQUES

JAQUES	I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted
	with thee

ROSALIND	They say you are a melancholy fellow

JAQUES	I am so I do love it better than laughing

ROSALIND	Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
	fellows and betray themselves to every modern
	censure worse than drunkards

JAQUES	Why tis good to be sad and say nothing

ROSALIND	Why then tis good to be a post

JAQUES	I have neither the scholars melancholy which is
	emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical
	nor the courtiers which is proud nor the
	soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers
	which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor
	the lovers which is all these but it is a
	melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples
	extracted from many objects and indeed the sundrys
	contemplation of my travels in which my often
	rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness

ROSALIND	A traveller By my faith you have great reason to
	be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see
	other mens then to have seen much and to have
	nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands

JAQUES	Yes I have gained my experience

ROSALIND	And your experience makes you sad I had rather have
	a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
	sad and to travel for it too

	Enter ORLANDO

ORLANDO	Good day and happiness dear Rosalind

JAQUES	Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse

	Exit

ROSALIND	Farewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and
	wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your
	own country be out of love with your nativity and
	almost chide God for making you that countenance you
	are or I will scarce think you have swam in a
	gondola Why how now Orlando where have you been
	all this while? You a lover An you serve me such
	another trick never come in my sight more

ORLANDO	My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise

ROSALIND	Break an hours promise in love He that will
	divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
	a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
	affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid
	hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant
	him heartwhole

ORLANDO	Pardon me dear Rosalind

ROSALIND	Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I
	had as lief be wooed of a snail

ORLANDO	Of a snail?

ROSALIND	Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he
	carries his house on his head a better jointure
	I think than you make a woman besides he brings
	his destiny with him

ORLANDO	Whats that?

ROSALIND	Why horns which such as you are fain to be
	beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in
	his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife

ORLANDO	Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous

ROSALIND	And I am your Rosalind

CELIA	It pleases him to call you so but he hath a
	Rosalind of a better leer than you

ROSALIND	Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday
	humour and like enough to consent What would you
	say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I would kiss before I spoke

ROSALIND	Nay you were better speak first and when you were
	gravelled for lack of matter you might take
	occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are
	out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod
	warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss

ORLANDO	How if the kiss be denied?

ROSALIND	Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter

ORLANDO	Who could be out being before his beloved mistress?

ROSALIND	Marry that should you if I were your mistress or
	I should think my honesty ranker than my wit

ORLANDO	What of my suit?

ROSALIND	Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
	Am not I your Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I take some joy to say you are because I would be
	talking of her

ROSALIND	Well in her person I say I will not have you

ORLANDO	Then in mine own person I die

ROSALIND	No faith die by attorney The poor world is
	almost six thousand years old and in all this time
	there was not any man died in his own person
	videlicit in a lovecause Troilus had his brains
	dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he
	could to die before and he is one of the patterns
	of love Leander he would have lived many a fair
	year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been
	for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
	but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
	taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
	coroners of that age found it was Hero of Sestos
	But these are all lies men have died from time to
	time and worms have eaten them but not for love

ORLANDO	I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind
	for I protest her frown might kill me

ROSALIND	By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now
	I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon
	disposition and ask me what you will I will grant
	it

ORLANDO	Then love me Rosalind

ROSALIND	Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all

ORLANDO	And wilt thou have me?

ROSALIND	Ay and twenty such

ORLANDO	What sayest thou?

ROSALIND	Are you not good?

ORLANDO	I hope so

ROSALIND	Why then can one desire too much of a good thing?
	Come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
	Give me your hand Orlando What do you say sister?

ORLANDO	Pray thee marry us

CELIA	I cannot say the words

ROSALIND	You must begin Will you Orlando

CELIA	Go to Will you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I will

ROSALIND	Ay but when?

ORLANDO	Why now as fast as she can marry us

ROSALIND	Then you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife

ORLANDO	I take thee Rosalind for wife

ROSALIND	I might ask you for your commission but I do take
	thee Orlando for my husband theres a girl goes
	before the priest and certainly a womans thought
	runs before her actions

ORLANDO	So do all thoughts they are winged

ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her after you
	have possessed her

ORLANDO	For ever and a day

ROSALIND	Say a day without the ever No no Orlando
	men are April when they woo December when they wed
	maids are May when they are maids but the sky
	changes when they are wives I will be more jealous
	of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen
	more clamorous than a parrot against rain more
	newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires
	than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana
	in the fountain and I will do that when you are
	disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyen and
	that when thou art inclined to sleep

ORLANDO	But will my Rosalind do so?

ROSALIND	By my life she will do as I do

ORLANDO	O but she is wise

ROSALIND	Or else she could not have the wit to do this the
	wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans
	wit and it will out at the casement shut that and
	twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly
	with the smoke out at the chimney

ORLANDO	A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say
	Wit whither wilt?

ROSALIND	Nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met
	your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed

ORLANDO	And what wit could wit have to excuse that?

ROSALIND	Marry to say she came to seek you there You shall
	never take her without her answer unless you take
	her without her tongue O that woman that cannot
	make her fault her husbands occasion let her
	never nurse her child herself for she will breed
	it like a fool

ORLANDO	For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee

ROSALIND	Alas dear love I cannot lack thee two hours

ORLANDO	I must attend the duke at dinner by two oclock I
	will be with thee again

ROSALIND	Ay go your ways go your ways I knew what you
	would prove my friends told me as much and I
	thought no less that flattering tongue of yours
	won me tis but one cast away and so come
	death Two oclock is your hour?

ORLANDO	Ay sweet Rosalind

ROSALIND	By my troth and in good earnest and so God mend
	me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous
	if you break one jot of your promise or come one
	minute behind your hour I will think you the most
	pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover
	and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
	may be chosen out of the gross band of the
	unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep
	your promise

ORLANDO	With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
	Rosalind so adieu

ROSALIND	Well Time is the old justice that examines all such
	offenders and let Time try adieu

	Exit ORLANDO

CELIA	You have simply misused our sex in your loveprate
	we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
	head and show the world what the bird hath done to
	her own nest

ROSALIND	O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou
	didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But
	it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown
	bottom like the bay of Portugal

CELIA	Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour
	affection in it runs out

ROSALIND	No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
	of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness
	that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes
	because his own are out let him be judge how deep I
	am in love Ill tell thee Aliena I cannot be out
	of the sight of Orlando Ill go find a shadow and
	sigh till he come

CELIA	And Ill sleep

	Exeunt

SCENE II	The forest


	Enter JAQUES Lords and Foresters

JAQUES	Which is he that killed the deer?

A Lord	Sir it was I

JAQUES	Lets present him to the duke like a Roman
	conqueror and it would do well to set the deers
	horns upon his head for a branch of victory Have
	you no song forester for this purpose?

Forester	Yes sir

JAQUES	Sing it tis no matter how it be in tune so it
	make noise enough

	SONG

	Thy fathers father wore it
	And thy father bore it
	The horn the horn the lusty horn
	Is not a thing to laugh to scorn

SCENE III	The forest


	Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

ROSALIND	How say you now? Is it not past two oclock? and
	here much Orlando

CELIA	I warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he
	hath taen his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
	sleep Look who comes here

	Enter SILVIUS

SILVIUS	My errand is to you fair youth
	My gentle Phebe bid me give you this
	I know not the contents but as I guess
	By the stern brow and waspish action
	Which she did use as she was writing of it
	It bears an angry tenor pardon me
	I am but as a guiltless messenger

ROSALIND	Patience herself would startle at this letter
	And play the swaggerer bear this bear all
	She says I am not fair that I lack manners
	She calls me proud and that she could not love me
	Were man as rare as phoenix Ods my will
	Her love is not the hare that I do hunt
	Why writes she so to me? Well shepherd well
	This is a letter of your own device

SILVIUS	No I protest I know not the contents
	Phebe did write it

ROSALIND	Come come you are a fool
	And turnd into the extremity of love
	I saw her hand she has a leathern hand
	A freestonecolourd hand I verily did think
	That her old gloves were on but twas her hands
	She has a huswifes hand but thats no matter
	I say she never did invent this letter
	This is a mans invention and his hand

SILVIUS	Sure it is hers

ROSALIND	Why tis a boisterous and a cruel style
	A style forchallengers why she defies me
	Like Turk to Christian womens gentle brain
	Could not drop forth such giantrude invention
	Such Ethiope words blacker in their effect
	Than in their countenance Will you hear the letter?

SILVIUS	So please you for I never heard it yet
	Yet heard too much of Phebes cruelty

ROSALIND	She Phebes me mark how the tyrant writes

	Reads

	Art thou god to shepherd turnd
	That a maidens heart hath burnd?
	Can a woman rail thus?

SILVIUS	Call you this railing?

ROSALIND	Reads

	Why thy godhead laid apart
	Warrst thou with a womans heart?
	Did you ever hear such railing?
	Whiles the eye of man did woo me
	That could do no vengeance to me
	Meaning me a beast
	If the scorn of your bright eyne
	Have power to raise such love in mine
	Alack in me what strange effect
	Would they work in mild aspect
	Whiles you chid me I did love
	How then might your prayers move
	He that brings this love to thee
	Little knows this love in me
	And by him seal up thy mind
	Whether that thy youth and kind
	Will the faithful offer take
	Of me and all that I can make
	Or else by him my love deny
	And then Ill study how to die

SILVIUS	Call you this chiding?

CELIA	Alas poor shepherd

ROSALIND	Do you pity him? no he deserves no pity Wilt
	thou love such a woman? What to make thee an
	instrument and play false strains upon thee not to
	be endured Well go your way to her for I see
	love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to
	her that if she love me I charge her to love
	thee if she will not I will never have her unless
	thou entreat for her If you be a true lover
	hence and not a word for here comes more company

	Exit SILVIUS

	Enter OLIVER

OLIVER	Good morrow fair ones pray you if you know
	Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
	A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?

CELIA	West of this place down in the neighbour bottom
	The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
	Left on your right hand brings you to the place
	But at this hour the house doth keep itself
	Theres none within

OLIVER	If that an eye may profit by a tongue
	Then should I know you by description
	Such garments and such years The boy is fair
	Of female favour and bestows himself
	Like a ripe sister the woman low
	And browner than her brother Are not you
	The owner of the house I did inquire for?

CELIA	It is no boast being askd to say we are

OLIVER	Orlando doth commend him to you both
	And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
	He sends this bloody napkin Are you he?

ROSALIND	I am what must we understand by this?

OLIVER	Some of my shame if you will know of me
	What man I am and how and why and where
