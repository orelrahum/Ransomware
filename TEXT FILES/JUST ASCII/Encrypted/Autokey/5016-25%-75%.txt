Will prove no sudden but a slowpaced evil
A long days dying to augment our pain
And to our seed O hapless seed derived
To whom thus Eve recovering heart replied
Adam by sad experiment I know
How little weight my words with thee can find
Found so erroneous thence by just event
Found so unfortunate  Nevertheless
Restored by thee vile as I am to place
Of new acceptance hopeful to regain
Thy love the sole contentment of my heart
Living or dying from thee I will not hide
What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen
Tending to some relief of our extremes
Or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable
As in our evils and of easier choice
If care of our descent perplex us most
Which must be born to certain woe devoured
By Death at last and miserable it is
To be to others cause of misery
Our own begotten and of our loins to bring
Into this cursed world a woeful race
That after wretched life must be at last
Food for so foul a monster in thy power
It lies yet ere conception to prevent
The race unblest to being yet unbegot
Childless thou art childless remain so Death
Shall be deceived his glut and with us two
Be forced to satisfy his ravenous maw
But if thou judge it hard and difficult
Conversing looking loving to abstain
From loves due rights nuptial embraces sweet
And with desire to languish without hope
Before the present object languishing
With like desire which would be misery
And torment less than none of what we dread
Then both ourselves and seed at once to free
From what we fear for both let us make short 
Let us seek Death  or he not found supply
With our own hands his office on ourselves
Why stand we longer shivering under fears
That show no end but death and have the power
Of many ways to die the shortest choosing
Destruction with destruction to destroy? 
She ended here or vehement despair
Broke off the rest so much of death her thoughts
Had entertained as dyed her cheeks with pale
But Adam with such counsel nothing swayed
To better hopes his more attentive mind
Labouring had raised and thus to Eve replied
Eve thy contempt of life and pleasure seems
To argue in thee something more sublime
And excellent than what thy mind contemns
But selfdestruction therefore sought refutes
That excellence thought in thee and implies
Not thy contempt but anguish and regret
For loss of life and pleasure overloved
Or if thou covet death as utmost end
Of misery so thinking to evade
The penalty pronounced doubt not but God
Hath wiselier armed his vengeful ire than so
To be forestalled much more I fear lest death
So snatched will not exempt us from the pain
We are by doom to pay rather such acts
Of contumacy will provoke the Highest
To make death in us live  Then let us seek
Some safer resolution which methinks
I have in view calling to mind with heed
Part of our sentence that thy seed shall bruise
The Serpents head piteous amends unless
Be meant whom I conjecture our grand foe
Satan who in the serpent hath contrived
Against us this deceit  To crush his head
Would be revenge indeed which will be lost
By death brought on ourselves or childless days
Resolved as thou proposest so our foe
Shal scape his punishment ordained and we
Instead shall double ours upon our heads
No more be mentioned then of violence
Against ourselves and wilful barrenness
That cuts us off from hope and savours only
Rancour and pride impatience and despite
Reluctance against God and his just yoke
Laid on our necks  Remember with what mild
And gracious temper he both heard and judged
Without wrath or reviling we expected
Immediate dissolution which we thought
Was meant by death that day when loto thee
Pains only in childbearing were foretold
And bringing forth soon recompensed with joy
Fruit of thy womb  On me the curse aslope
Glanced on the ground with labour I must earn
My bread what harm? Idleness had been worse
My labour will sustain me and lest cold
Or heat should injure us his timely care
Hath unbesought provided and his hands
Clothed us unworthy pitying while he judged
How much more if we pray him will his ear
Be open and his heart to pity incline
And teach us further by what means to shun
The inclement seasons rain ice hail and snow
Which now the sky with various face begins
To show us in this mountain while the winds
Blow moist and keen shattering the graceful locks
Of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek
Some better shroud some better warmth to cherish
Our limbs benummed ere this diurnal star
Leave cold the night how we his gathered beams
Reflected may with matter sere foment
Or by collision of two bodies grind
The air attrite to fire as late the clouds
Justling or pushed with winds rude in their shock
Tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame driven down
Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine
And sends a comfortable heat from far
Which might supply the sun  Such fire to use
And what may else be remedy or cure
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought
He will instruct us praying and of grace
Beseeching him so as we need not fear
To pass commodiously this life sustained
By him with many comforts till we end
In dust our final rest and native home
What better can we do than to the place
Repairing where he judged us prostrate fall
Before him reverent and there confess
Humbly our faults and pardon beg with tears
Watering the ground and with our sighs the air
Frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign
Of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek



Book XI


Undoubtedly he will relent and turn
From his displeasure in whose look serene
When angry most he seemed and most severe
What else but favour grace and mercy shone?
So spake our father penitent nor Eve
Felt less remorse they forthwith to the place
Repairing where he judged them prostrate fell
Before him reverent and both confessed
Humbly their faults and pardon begged with tears
Watering the ground and with their sighs the air
Frequenting sent from hearts contrite in sign
Of sorrow unfeigned and humiliation meek
Thus they in lowliest plight repentant stood
Praying for from the mercyseat above
Prevenient grace descending had removed
The stony from their hearts and made new flesh
Regenerate grow instead that sighs now breathed
Unutterable which the Spirit of prayer
Inspired and winged for Heaven with speedier flight
Than loudest oratory  Yet their port
Not of mean suitors nor important less
Seemed their petition than when the ancient pair
In fables old less ancient yet than these
Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha to restore
The race of mankind drowned before the shrine
Of Themis stood devout  To Heaven their prayers
Flew up nor missed the way by envious winds
Blown vagabond or frustrate in they passed
Dimensionless through heavenly doors then clad
With incense where the golden altar fumed
By their great intercessour came in sight
Before the Fathers throne them the glad Son
Presenting thus to intercede began
See Father what firstfruits on earth are sprung
From thy implanted grace in Man these sighs
And prayers which in this golden censer mixed
With incense I thy priest before thee bring
Fruits of more pleasing savour from thy seed
Sown with contrition in his heart than those
Which his own hand manuring all the trees
Of Paradise could have produced ere fallen
From innocence  Now therefore bend thine ear
To supplication hear his sighs though mute
Unskilful with what words to pray let me
Interpret for him me his advocate
And propitiation all his works on me
Good or not good ingraft my merit those
Shall perfect and for these my death shall pay
Accept me and in me from these receive
The smell of peace toward mankind let him live
Before thee reconciled at least his days
Numbered though sad till death his doom which I
To mitigate thus plead not to reverse
To better life shall yield him where with me
All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss
Made one with me as I with thee am one
To whom the Father without cloud serene
All thy request for Man accepted Son
Obtain all thy request was my decree
But longer in that Paradise to dwell
The law I gave to Nature him forbids
Those pure immortal elements that know
No gross no unharmonious mixture foul
Eject him tainted now and purge him off
As a distemper gross to air as gross
And mortal food as may dispose him best
For dissolution wrought by sin that first
Distempered all things and of incorrupt
Corrupted  I at first with two fair gifts
Created him endowed with happiness
And immortality that fondly lost
This other served but to eternize woe
Till I provided death so death becomes
His final remedy and after life
Tried in sharp tribulation and refined
By faith and faithful works to second life
Waked in the renovation of the just
Resigns him up with Heaven and Earth renewed
But let us call to synod all the Blest
Through Heavens wide bounds from them I will not hide
My judgements how with mankind I proceed
As how with peccant Angels late they saw
And in their state though firm stood more confirmed
He ended and the Son gave signal high
To the bright minister that watched he blew
His trumpet heard in Oreb since perhaps
When God descended and perhaps once more
To sound at general doom  The angelick blast
Filled all the regions from their blisful bowers
Of amarantine shade fountain or spring
By the waters of life whereer they sat
In fellowships of joy the sons of light
Hasted resorting to the summons high
And took their seats till from his throne supreme
The Almighty thus pronounced his sovran will
O Sons like one of us Man is become
To know both good and evil since his taste
Of that defended fruit but let him boast
His knowledge of good lost and evil got
Happier had it sufficed him to have known
Good by itself and evil not at all
He sorrows now repents and prays contrite
My motions in him longer than they move
His heart I know how variable and vain
Selfleft  Lest therefore his now bolder hand
Reach also of the tree of life and eat
And live for ever dream at least to live
For ever to remove him I decree
And send him from the garden forth to till
The ground whence he was taken fitter soil
Michael this my behest have thou in charge
Take to thee from among the Cherubim
Thy choice of flaming warriours lest the Fiend
Or in behalf of Man or to invade
Vacant possession some new trouble raise
Haste thee and from the Paradise of God
Without remorse drive out the sinful pair
From hallowed ground the unholy and denounce
To them and to their progeny from thence
Perpetual banishment  Yet lest they faint
At the sad sentence rigorously urged
For I behold them softened and with tears
Bewailing their excess all terrour hide
If patiently thy bidding they obey
Dismiss them not disconsolate reveal
To Adam what shall come in future days
As I shall thee enlighten intermix
My covenant in the Womans seed renewed
So send them forth though sorrowing yet in peace
And on the east side of the garden place
Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs
Cherubick watch and of a sword the flame
Widewaving all approach far off to fright
And guard all passage to the tree of life
Lest Paradise a receptacle prove
To Spirits foul and all my trees their prey
With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude
He ceased and the archangelick Power prepared
For swift descent with him the cohort bright
Of watchful Cherubim four faces each
Had like a double Janus all their shape
Spangled with eyes more numerous than those
Of Argus and more wakeful than to drouse
Charmed with Arcadian pipe the pastoral reed
Of Hermes or his opiate rod  Mean while
To resalute the world with sacred light
Leucothea waked and with fresh dews imbalmed
The earth when Adam and first matron Eve
Had ended now their orisons and found
Strength added from above new hope to spring
Out of despair joy but with fear yet linked
Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed
Eve easily my faith admit that all
The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends
But that from us aught should ascend to Heaven
So prevalent as to concern the mind
Of God highblest or to incline his will
Hard to belief may seem yet this will prayer
Or one short sigh of human breath upborne
Even to the seat of God  For since I sought
By prayer the offended Deity to appease
Kneeled and before him humbled all my heart
Methought I saw him placable and mild
Bending his ear persuasion in me grew
That I was heard with favour peace returned
Home to my breast and to my memory
His promise that thy seed shall bruise our foe
Which then not minded in dismay yet now
Assures me that the bitterness of death
Is past and we shall live  Whence hail to thee
Eve rightly called mother of all mankind
Mother of all things living since by thee
Man is to live and all things live for Man
To whom thus Eve with sad demeanour meek
Illworthy I such title should belong
To me transgressour who for thee ordained
A help became thy snare to me reproach
Rather belongs distrust and all dispraise
But infinite in pardon was my Judge
That I who first brought death on all am graced
The source of life next favourable thou
Who highly thus to entitle me vouchsafst
Far other name deserving  But the field
To labour calls us now with sweat imposed
Though after sleepless night for seethe morn
All unconcerned with our unrest begins
Her rosy progress smiling let us forth
I never from thy side henceforth to stray
Whereer our days work lies though now enjoined
Laborious till day droop while here we dwell
What can be toilsome in these pleasant walks?
Here let us live though in fallen state content
So spake so wished much humbled Eve but Fate
Subscribed not  Nature first gave signs impressed
On bird beast air air suddenly eclipsed
After short blush of morn nigh in her sight
The bird of Jove stooped from his aery tour
Two birds of gayest plume before him drove
Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods
First hunter then pursued a gentle brace
Goodliest of all the forest hart and hind
Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight
Adam observed and with his eye the chase
Pursuing not unmoved to Eve thus spake
O Eve some further change awaits us nigh
Which Heaven by these mute signs in Nature shows
Forerunners of his purpose or to warn
Us haply too secure of our discharge
From penalty because from death released
Some days how long and what till then our life
Who knows? or more than this that we are dust
And thither must return and be no more?
Why else this double object in our sight
Of flight pursued in the air and oer the ground
One way the selfsame hour? why in the east
Darkness ere days midcourse and morninglight
More orient in yon western cloud that draws
Oer the blue firmament a radiant white
And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?
He erred not for by this the heavenly bands
Down from a sky of jasper lighted now
In Paradise and on a hill made halt
A glorious apparition had not doubt
And carnal fear that day dimmed Adams eye
Not that more glorious when the Angels met
Jacob in Mahanaim where he saw
The field pavilioned with his guardians bright
Nor that which on the flaming mount appeared
In Dothan covered with a camp of fire
Against the Syrian king who to surprise
One man assassinlike had levied war
War unproclaimed  The princely Hierarch
In their bright stand there left his Powers to seise
Possession of the garden he alone
To find where Adam sheltered took his way
Not unperceived of Adam who to Eve
While the great visitant approached thus spake
Eve now expect great tidings which perhaps
Of us will soon determine or impose
New laws to be observed for I descry
From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill
One of the heavenly host and by his gait
None of the meanest some great Potentate
Or of the Thrones above such majesty
Invests him coming yet not terrible
That I should fear nor sociably mild
As Raphael that I should much confide
But solemn and sublime whom not to offend
