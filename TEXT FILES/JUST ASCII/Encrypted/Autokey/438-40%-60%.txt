Dislodging from a region scarce of prey
To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids
On hills where flocks are fed flies toward the springs
Of Ganges or Hydaspes Indian streams
But in his way lights on the barren plains
Of Sericana where Chineses drive
With sails and wind their cany waggons light
So on this windy sea of land the Fiend
Walked up and down alone bent on his prey
Alone for other creature in this place
Living or lifeless to be found was none
None yet but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like aereal vapours flew
Of all things transitory and vain when sin
With vanity had filled the works of men
Both all things vain and all who in vain things
Built their fond hopes of glory or lasting fame
Or happiness in this or the other life
All who have their reward on earth the fruits
Of painful superstition and blind zeal
Nought seeking but the praise of men here find
Fit retribution empty as their deeds
All the unaccomplished works of Natures hand
Abortive monstrous or unkindly mixed
Dissolved on earth fleet hither and in vain
Till final dissolution wander here
Not in the neighbouring moon as some have dreamed
Those argent fields more likely habitants
Translated Saints or middle Spirits hold
Betwixt the angelical and human kind
Hither of illjoined sons and daughters born
First from the ancient world those giants came
With many a vain exploit though then renowned
The builders next of Babel on the plain
Of Sennaar and still with vain design
New Babels had they wherewithal would build
Others came single he who to be deemed
A God leaped fondly into Aetna flames
Empedocles and he who to enjoy
Platos Elysium leaped into the sea
Cleombrotus and many more too long
Embryos and idiots eremites and friars
White black and gray with all their trumpery
Here pilgrims roam that strayed so far to seek
In Golgotha him dead who lives in Heaven
And they who to be sure of Paradise
Dying put on the weeds of Dominick
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised
They pass the planets seven and pass the fixed
And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs
The trepidation talked and that first moved
And now Saint Peter at Heavens wicket seems
To wait them with his keys and now at foot
Of Heavens ascent they lift their feet when lo
A violent cross wind from either coast
Blows them transverse ten thousand leagues awry
Into the devious air  Then might ye see
Cowls hoods and habits with their wearers tost
And fluttered into rags then reliques beads
Indulgences dispenses pardons bulls
The sport of winds  All these upwhirled aloft
Fly oer the backside of the world far off
Into a Limbo large and broad since called
The Paradise of Fools to few unknown
Long after now unpeopled and untrod
All this dark globe the Fiend found as he passed
And long he wandered till at last a gleam
Of dawning light turned thitherward in haste
His travelled steps far distant he descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high
At top whereof but far more rich appeared
The work as of a kingly palacegate
With frontispiece of diamond and gold
Embellished thick with sparkling orient gems
The portal shone inimitable on earth
By model or by shading pencil drawn
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
Angels ascending and descending bands
Of guardians bright when he from Esau fled
To PadanAram in the field of Luz
Dreaming by night under the open sky
And waking cried  This is the gate of Heaven
Each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
There always but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
Viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed
Of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon
Who after came from earth failing arrived
Wafted by Angels or flew oer the lake
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds
The stairs were then let down whether to dare
The Fiend by easy ascent or aggravate
His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss
Direct against which opened from beneath
Just oer the blissful seat of Paradise
A passage down to the Earth a passage wide
Wider by far than that of aftertimes
Over mount Sion and though that were large
Over the Promised Land to God so dear
By which to visit oft those happy tribes
On high behests his angels to and fro
Passed frequent and his eye with choice regard
From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood
To Beersaba where the Holy Land
Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore
So wide the opening seemed where bounds were set
To darkness such as bound the ocean wave
Satan from hence now on the lower stair
That scaled by steps of gold to Heavengate
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this world at once  As when a scout
Through dark?nd desart ways with?oeril gone
All?might?t?kast by break of cheerful dawn
Obtains the brow of some highclimbing hill
Which to his eye discovers unaware
The goodly prospect of some foreign land
First seen or some renowned metropolis
With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned
Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams
Such wonder seised though after Heaven seen
The Spirit malign but much more envy seised
At sight of all this world beheld so fair
Round he surveys and well might where he stood
So high above the circling canopy
Of nights extended shade from eastern point
Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears
Andromeda far off Atlantick seas
Beyond the horizon then from pole to pole
He views in breadth and without longer pause
Down right into the worlds first region throws
His flight precipitant and winds with ease
Through the pure marble air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable stars that shone
Stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds
Or other worlds they seemed or happy isles
Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old
Fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales
Thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there
He staid not to inquire  Above them all
The golden sun in splendour likest Heaven
Allured his eye thither his course he bends
Through the calm firmament but up or down
By center or eccentrick hard to tell
Or longitude where the great luminary
Aloof the vulgar constellations thick
That from his lordly eye keep distance due
Dispenses light from far they as they move
Their starry dance in numbers that compute
Days months and years towards his allcheering lamp
Turn swift their various motions or are turned
By his magnetick beam that gently warms
The universe and to each inward part
With gentle penetration though unseen
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep
So wonderously was set his station bright
There lands the Fiend a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the suns lucent orb
Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw
The place he found beyond expression bright
Compared with aught on earth metal or stone
Not all parts like but all alike informed
