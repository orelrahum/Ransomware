                ALICES ADVENTURES IN WONDERLAND

                          Lewis Carroll

               THE MILLENNIUM FULCRUM EDITION 




                            CHAPTER I

                      Down the RabbitHole


  Alice was beginning to get very tired of sitting by her sister
on the bank and of having nothing to do  once or twice she had
peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no
pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book
thought Alice without pictures or conversation?

  So she was considering in her own mind as well as she could
for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether
the pleasure of making a daisychain would be worth the trouble
of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a White
Rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her

  There was nothing so VERY remarkable in that nor did Alice
think it so VERY much out of the way to hear the Rabbit say to
itself Oh dear  Oh dear  I shall be late  when she thought
it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have
wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural
but when the Rabbit actually TOOK A WATCH OUT OF ITS WAISTCOAT
POCKET and looked at it and then hurried on Alice started to
her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never
before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoatpocket or a watch to
take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the
field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop
down a large rabbithole under the hedge

  In another moment down went Alice after it never once
considering how in the world she was to get out again

  The rabbithole went straight on like a tunnel for some way
and then dipped suddenly down so suddenly that Alice had not a
moment to think about stopping herself before she found herself
falling down a very deep well

  Either the well was very deep or she fell very slowly for she
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
wonder what was going to happen next  First she tried to look
down and make out what she was coming to but it was too dark to
see anything then she looked at the sides of the well and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs  She
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was
labelled ORANGE MARMALADE but to her great disappointment it
was empty  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
somebody so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
fell past it

  Well thought Alice to herself after such a fall as this I
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs  How brave theyll
all think me at home  Why I wouldnt say anything about it
even if I fell off the top of the house Which was very likely
true

  Down down down  Would the fall NEVER come to an end  I
wonder how many miles Ive fallen by this time? she said aloud
I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth  Let
me see  that would be four thousand miles down I think for
you see Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
lessons in the schoolroom and though this was not a VERY good
opportunity for showing off her knowledge as there was no one to
listen to her still it was good practice to say it over yes
thats about the right distancebut then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude Ive got to?  Alice had no idea what Latitude was
or Longitude either but thought they were nice grand words to
say

  Presently she began again  I wonder if I shall fall right
THROUGH the earth  How funny itll seem to come out among the
people that walk with their heads downward  The Antipathies I
think she was rather glad there WAS no one listening this
time as it didnt sound at all the right word but I shall
have to ask them what the name of the country is you know
Please Maam is this New Zealand or Australia? and she tried
to curtsey as she spokefancy CURTSEYING as youre falling
through the air  Do you think you could manage it?  And what
an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking  No itll
never do to ask  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere

  Down down down  There was nothing else to do so Alice soon
began talking again  Dinahll miss me very much tonight I
should think  Dinah was the cat  I hope theyll remember
her saucer of milk at teatime  Dinah my dear  I wish you were
down here with me  There are no mice in the air Im afraid but
you might catch a bat and thats very like a mouse you know
But do cats eat bats I wonder?  And here Alice began to get
rather sleepy and went on saying to herself in a dreamy sort of
way Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats? and sometimes Do
bats eat cats? for you see as she couldnt answer either
question it didnt much matter which way she put it  She felt
that she was dozing off and had just begun to dream that she
was walking hand in hand with Dinah and saying to her very
earnestly Now Dinah tell me the truth  did you ever eat a
bat? when suddenly thump thump down she came upon a heap of
sticks and dry leaves and the fall was over

  Alice was not a bit hurt and she jumped up on to her feet in a
moment  she looked up but it was all dark overhead before her
was another long passage and the White Rabbit was still in
sight hurrying down it  There was not a moment to be lost
away went Alice like the wind and was just in time to hear it
say as it turned a corner Oh my ears and whiskers how late
its getting  She was close behind it when she turned the
corner but the Rabbit was no longer to be seen  she found
herself in a long low hall which was lit up by a row of lamps
hanging from the roof

  There were doors all round the hall but they were all locked
and when Alice had been all the way down one side and up the
other trying every door she walked sadly down the middle
wondering how she was ever to get out again

  Suddenly she came upon a little threelegged table all made of
solid glass there was nothing on it except a tiny golden key
and Alices first thought was that it might belong to one of the
doors of HYW VFES FBT LWBM XIEHWV BAL PFVRW HSTO LKS CEKUS ZR
