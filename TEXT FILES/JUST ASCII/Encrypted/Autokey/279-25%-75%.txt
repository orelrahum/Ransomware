in the present world of immature standards and lack of understanding of
what network information is or what the ground rules are for creating or
using it publishing information on a CDROM does add value in a very
real sense

LYNCH drew a contrast between CDROM and network pricing and in doing so
highlighted something bizarre in information pricing  A large
institution such as the University of California has vendors who will
offer to sell information on CDROM for a price per year in four digits
but for the same data eg an abstracting and indexing database on
magnetic tape regardless of how many people may use it concurrently
will quote a price in six digits

What is packaged with the CDROM in one sense adds valuea complete
access system not just raw unrefined informationalthough it is not
generally perceived that way  This is because the access software
although it adds value is viewed by some people particularly in the
university environment where there is a very heavy commitment to
networking as being developed in the wrong direction

Given that context LYNCH described the examples demonstrated as a set of
insular information gemsPerseus for example offers nicely linked
information but would be very difficult to integrate with other
databases that is to link together seamlessly with other source files
from other sources  It resembles an island and in this respect is
similar to numerous standalone projects that are based on videodiscs
that is on the singleworkstation concept

As scholarship evolves in a network environment the paramount need will
be to link databases  We must link personal databases to public
databases to group databases in fairly seamless wayswhich is
extremely difficult in the environments under discussion with copies of
databases proliferating all over the place

The notion of layering also struck LYNCH as lurking in several of the
projects demonstrated  Several databases in a sense constitute
information archives without a significant amount of navigation built in
Educators critics and others will want a layered structureone that
defines or links paths through the layers to allow users to reach
specific points  In LYNCHs view layering will become increasingly
necessary and not just within a single resource but across resources
eg tracing mythology and cultural themes across several classics
databases as well as a database of Renaissance culture  This ability to
organize resources to build things out of multiple other things on the
network or select pieces of it represented for LYNCH one of the key
aspects of network information

Contending that information reuse constituted another significant issue
LYNCH commended to the audiences attention Project NEEDS ie National
Engineering Education Delivery System  This projects objective is to
produce a database of engineering courseware as well as the components
that can be used to develop new courseware  In a number of the existing
applications LYNCH said the issue of reuse how much one can take apart
and reuse in other applications was not being well considered  He also
raised the issue of active versus passive use one aspect of which  is
how much information will be manipulated locally by users  Most people
he argued may do a little browsing and then will wish to print  LYNCH
was uncertain how these resources would be used by the vast majority of
users in the network environment

LYNCH next said a few words about XWindows as a way of differentiating
between network access and networked information  A number of the
applications demonstrated at the Workshop could be rewritten to use X
across the network so that one could run them from any Xcapable device
a workstation an X terminaland transact with a database across the
network  Although this opens up access a little assuming one has enough
network to handle it it does not provide an interface to develop a
program that conveniently integrates information from multiple databases
X is a viewing technology that has limits  In a real sense it is just a
graphical version of remote login across the network  Xtype applications
represent only one step in the progression towards real access

LYNCH next discussed barriers to the distribution of networked multimedia
information  The heart of the problem is a lack of standards to provide
the ability for computers to talk to each other retrieve information
and shuffle it around fairly casually  At the moment little progress is
being made on standards for networked information for example present
standards do not cover images digital voice and digital video  A
useful tool kit of exchange formats for basic texts is only now being
assembled  The synchronization of content streams ie synchronizing a
voice track to a video track establishing temporal relations between
different components in a multimedia object constitutes another issue
for networked multimedia that is just beginning to receive attention

Underlying network protocols also need some work good realtime
delivery protocols on the Internet do not yet exist  In LYNCHs view
highly important in this context is the notion of networked digital
object IDs the ability of one object on the network to point to another
object or component thereof on the network  Serious bandwidth issues
also exist  LYNCH was uncertain if billionbitpersecond networks would
prove sufficient if numerous people ran video in parallel

LYNCH concluded by offering an issue for database creators to consider
as well as several comments about what might constitute good trial
multimedia experiments  In a networked information world the database
builder or service builder publisher does not exercise the same
extensive control over the integrity of the presentation strange
programs "munge" with ones data before the user sees it  Serious
thought must be given to what guarantees integrity of presentation  Part
of that is related to where one draws the boundaries around a networked
information service  This question of presentation integrity in
clientserver computing has not been stressed enough in the academic
world LYNCH argued though commercial service providers deal with it
regularly

Concerning multimedia LYNCH observed that good multimedia at the moment
is hideously expensive to produce  He recommended producing multimedia
with either very high sale value or multimedia with a very long life
span or multimedia that will have a very broad usage base and whose
costs therefore can be amortized among large numbers of users  In this
connection historical and humanistically oriented material may be a good
place to start because it tends to have a longer life span than much of
the scientific material as well as a wider user base  LYNCH noted for
example that American Memory fits many of the criteria outlined  He
remarked the extensive discussion about bringing the Internet or the
National Research and Education Network NREN into the K environment
as a way of helping the American educational system

LYNCH closed by noting that the kinds of applications demonstrated struck
him as excellent justifications of broadscale networking for K but
that at this time no "killer" application exists to mobilize the K
community to obtain connectivity

                                 


DISCUSSION  Dearth of genuinely interesting applications on the network
a slowchanging situation  The issue of the integrity of presentation in
a networked environment  Several reasons why CDROM software does not
network 


During the discussion period that followed LYNCHs presentation several
additional points were made

LYNCH reiterated even more strongly his contention that historically
once one goes outside highend science and the group of those who need
access to supercomputers there is a great dearth of genuinely
interesting applications on the network  He saw this situation changing
slowly with some of the scientific databases and scholarly discussion
groups and electronic journals coming on as well as with the availability
of Wide Area Information Servers WAIS and some of the databases that
are being mounted there  However many of those things do not seem to
have piqued great popular interest  For instance most high school
students of LYNCHs acquaintance would not qualify as devotees of serious
molecular biology

Concerning the issue of the integrity of presentation LYNCH believed
that a couple of information providers have laid down the law at least on
certain things  For example his recollection was that the National
Library of Medicine feels strongly that one needs to employ the
identifier field if he or she is to mount a database commercially  The
problem with a real networked environment is that one does not know who
is reformatting and reprocessing ones data when one enters a client
server mode  It becomes anybodys guess for example if the network
uses a Z server or what clients are doing with ones data  A data
provider can say that his contract will only permit clients to have
access to his data after he vets them and their presentation and makes
certain it suits him  But LYNCH held out little expectation that the
network marketplace would evolve in that way because it required too
much prior negotiation

CDROM software does not network for a variety of reasons LYNCH said
He speculated that CDROM publishers are not eager to have their products
really hook into wide area networks because they fear it will make their
data suppliers nervous  Moreover until relatively recently one had to
be rather adroit to run a full TCPIP stack plus applications on a
PCsize machine whereas nowadays it is becoming easier as PCs grow
bigger and faster  LYNCH also speculated that software providers had not
heard from their customers until the last year or so or had not heard
from enough of their customers

                                 


BESSER  Implications of disseminating images on the network planning
the distribution of multimedia documents poses two critical
implementation problems  Layered approach represents the way to deal
with users capabilities  Problems in platform design file size and its
implications for networking  Transmission of megabyte size images
impractical  Compression and decompression at the users end  Promising
trends for compression  A disadvantage of using XWindows  A project at
the Smithsonian that mounts images on several networks 


Howard BESSER School of Library and Information Science University of
Pittsburgh spoke primarily about multimedia focusing on images and the
broad implications of disseminating them on the network  He argued that
