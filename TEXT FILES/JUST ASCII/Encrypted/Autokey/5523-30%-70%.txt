hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it
does

  Which would NOT be an advantage said Alice who felt very
glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her
knowledge  Just think of what work it would make with the day
and night  You see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn
round on its axis

  Talking of axes said the Duchess chop off her head

  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant
to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and
seemed not to be listening so she went on again  Twentyfour
hours I THINK or is it twelve?  I

  Oh dont bother ME said the Duchess I never could abide
figures  And with that she began nursing her child again
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a
violent shake at the end of every line

        Speak roughly to your little boy
          And beat him when he sneezes
        He only does it to annoy
          Because he knows it teases

                    CHORUS

    In which the cook and the baby joined

                Wow wow wow

  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept
tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing
howled so that Alice could hardly hear the words

        I speak severely to my boy
          I beat him when he sneezes
        For he can thoroughly enjoy
          The pepper when he pleases

                    CHORUS

                Wow wow wow

  Here you may nurse it a bit if you like the Duchess said
to Alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke  I must go and
get ready to play croquet with the Queen and she hurried out of
the room  The cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out
but it just missed her

  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer
shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all
directions just like a starfish thought Alice  The poor
little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again
so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much
as she could do to hold it

  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it
which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep
tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its
undoing itself she carried it out into the open air  IF I
dont take this child away with me thought Alice theyre sure
to kill it in a day or two  wouldnt it be murder to leave it
behind?  She said the last words out loud and the little thing
grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time  Dont
grunt said Alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself

  The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into
its face to see what was the matter with it  There could be no
doubt that it had a VERY turnup nose much more like a snout
than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for
a baby  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at
all  But perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked
into its eyes again to see if there were any tears

  No there were no tears  If youre going to turn into a pig
my dear said Alice seriously Ill have nothing more to do
with you  Mind now  The poor little thing sobbed again or
grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for
some while in silence

  Alice was just beginning to think to herself Now what am I
to do with this creature when I get it home? when it grunted
again so violently that she looked down into its face in some
alarm  This time there could be NO mistake about it  it was
neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be
quite absurd for her to carry it further

  So she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to
see it trot away quietly into the wood  If it had grown up
she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child
but it makes rather a handsome pig I think  And she began
thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as
pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right
way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing
the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off

  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice  It looked good
natured she thought  still it had VERY long claws and a great
many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect

  Cheshire Puss she began rather timidly as she did not at
all know whether it would like the name  however it only
grinned a little wider  Come its pleased so far thought
Alice and she went on  Would you tell me please which way I
ought to go from here?

  That depends a good deal on where you want to get to said
the Cat

  I dont much care where said Alice

  Then it doesnt matter which way you go said the Cat

  so long as I get SOMEWHERE Alice added as an explanation

  Oh youre sure to do that said the Cat if you only walk
long enough

  Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another
question  What sort of people live about here?

  In THAT direction the Cat said waving its right paw round
lives a Hatter  and in THAT direction waving the other paw
lives a March Hare  Visit either you like  theyre both mad

  But I dont want to go among mad people Alice remarked

  Oh you cant help that said the Cat  were all mad here
Im mad  Youre mad

  How do you know Im mad? said Alice

  You must be said the Cat or you wouldnt have come here

  Alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on
And how do you know that youre mad?

  To begin with said the Cat a dogs not mad  You grant
that?

  I suppose so said Alice

  Well then the Cat went on you see a dog growls when its
angry and wags its tail when its pleased  Now I growl when Im
pleased and wag my tail when Im angry  Therefore Im mad

  I call it purring not growling said Alice

  Call it what you like said the Cat  Do you play croquet
with the Queen today?

  I should like it very much said Alice but I havent been
invited yet

  Youll see me there said the Cat and vanished

  Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used
to queer things happening  While she was looking at the place
where it had been it suddenly appeared again

  Bythebye what became of the baby? said the Cat  Id
nearly forgotten to ask

  It turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it had
come back in a natural way

  I thought it would said the Cat and vanished again

  Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it
did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the
direction in which the March Hare was said to live  Ive seen
hatters before she said to herself the March Hare will be
much the most interesting and perhaps as this is May it wont be
raving madat least not so mad as it was in March  As she said
this she looked up and there was the Cat again sitting on a
branch of a tree

  Did you say pig or fig? said the Cat

  I said pig replied Alice and I wish you wouldnt keep
appearing and vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy

  All right said the Cat and this time it vanished quite
slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the
grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone

  Well  Ive often seen a cat without a grin thought Alice
but a grin without a cat  Its the most curious thing I ever
say in my life

  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the
house of the March Hare  she thought it must be the right house
because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was
thatched with fur  It was so large a house that she did not
like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand
bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high  even
then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself
Suppose it should be raving mad after all  I almost wish Id
gone to see the Hatter instead



                           CHAPTER VII

                         A Mad TeaParty


  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house
and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it  a
Dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two
were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and the
talking over its head  Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse
thought Alice only as its asleep I suppose it doesnt mind

  The table was a large one but the three were all crowded
together at one corner of it  No room  No room they cried
out when they saw Alice coming  Theres PLENTY of room said
Alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one
end of the table

  Have some wine the March Hare said in an encouraging tone

  Alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it
but tea  I dont see any wine she remarked

  There isnt any said the March Hare

  Then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said Alice
angrily

  It wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being
invited said the March Hare

  I didnt know it was YOUR table said Alice its laid for a
great many FARR RTOE XAYER
