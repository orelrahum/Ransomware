Gabon Economy

Overview
    The economy dependent on timber and manganese until the early s is now
    dominated by the oil sector During the period  oil accounted for
    about  of GDP  of export earnings and  of government revenues on
    average The high oil prices of the early s contributed to a substantial
    increase in per capita income stimulated domestic demand reinforced
    migration from rural to urban areas and raised the level of real wages to
    among the highest in SubSaharan Africa The threeyear slide of Gabons
    economy which began with falling oil prices in  was reversed in 
    because of a near doubling of oil prices over their  lows In  the
    economy posted strong growth despite serious strikes but debt servicing
    problems are hindering economic advancement The agricultural and industrial
    sectors are relatively underdeveloped except for oil

    President Bushs post  Gulf crisis peace initiative the final status of
    the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors
    and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process
