Trinidad and Tobago Economy

Overview
    Trinidad and Tobagos petroleumbased economy began to emerge from a lengthy
    depression in  and  The economy fell sharply through most of the
    s largely because of the decline in oil prices This sector accounts
    for  of export earnings and more than  of GDP The government in
    response to the oil revenue loss pursued a series of austerity measures
    that pushed the unemployment rate as high as  in  The economy showed
    signs of recovery in  however helped along by rising oil prices
    Agriculture employs only about  of the labor force and produces about 
    of GDP Since this sector is small it has been unable to absorb the large
    numbers of the unemployed The government currently seeks to diversify its
    export base
