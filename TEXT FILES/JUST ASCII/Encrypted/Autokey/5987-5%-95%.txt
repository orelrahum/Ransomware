    precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports coffee
    cocoa and petroleum Export earnings were cut by almost onethird and
    inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed In  with support
    from the IMF and World Bank the government has begun to introduce reforms
    designed to spur business investment increase efficiency in agriculture
    and recapitalize the nations banks Nationwide strikes organized by
    opposition parties in  however undermined these efforts
