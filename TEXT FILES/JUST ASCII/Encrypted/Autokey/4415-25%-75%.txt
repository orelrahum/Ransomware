  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
bythe frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their neverending meal
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the
Duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce
more the shriek of the Gryphon the squeaking of the Lizards
slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs
filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle

  So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in
Wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and
all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only
rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep
bells and the Queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the Gryphon and
all thy other queer noises would change she knew to the
confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtles
heavy sobs

  Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how
she would keep through all her riper years the simple and
loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about
her other little children and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their
simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys
remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days

ACT I



SCENE I	Orchard of Olivers house


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

ORLANDO	As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion
	bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns
	and as thou sayest charged my brother on his
	blessing to breed me well and there begins my
	sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and
	report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part
	he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more
	properly stays me here at home unkept for call you
	that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that
	differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
	are bred better for besides that they are fair
	with their feeding they are taught their manage
	and to that end riders dearly hired but I his
	brother gain nothing under him but growth for the
	which his animals on his dunghills are as much
	bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so
	plentifully gives me the something that nature gave
	me his countenance seems to take from me he lets
	me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
	brother and as much as in him lies mines my
	gentility with my education This is it Adam that
	grieves me and the spirit of my father which I
	think is within me begins to mutiny against this
	servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I
	know no wise remedy how to avoid it

ADAM	Yonder comes my master your brother

ORLANDO	Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will
	shake me up

	Enter OLIVER

OLIVER	Now sir what make you here?

ORLANDO	Nothing I am not taught to make any thing

OLIVER	What mar you then sir?

ORLANDO	Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God
	made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness

OLIVER	Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile

ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
	What prodigal portion have I spent that I should
	come to such penury?

OLIVER	Know you where your are sir?

ORLANDO	O sir very well here in your orchard

OLIVER	Know you before whom sir?

ORLANDO	Ay better than him I am before knows me I know
	you are my eldest brother and in the gentle
	condition of blood you should so know me The
	courtesy of nations allows you my better in that
	you are the firstborn but the same tradition
	takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers
	betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as
	you albeit I confess your coming before me is
	nearer to his reverence

OLIVER	What boy

ORLANDO	Come come elder brother you are too young in this

OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me villain?

ORLANDO	I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir
	Rowland de Boys he was my father and he is thrice
	a villain that says such a father begot villains
	Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand
	from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
	tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself

ADAM	Sweet masters be patient for your fathers
	remembrance be at accord

OLIVER	Let me go I say

ORLANDO	I will not till I please you shall hear me My
	father charged you in his will to give me good
	education you have trained me like a peasant
	obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike
	qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in
	me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow
	me such exercises as may become a gentleman or
	give me the poor allottery my father left me by
	testament with that I will go buy my fortunes

OLIVER	And what wilt thou do? beg when that is spent?
	Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled
	with you you shall have some part of your will I
	pray you leave me

ORLANDO	I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good

OLIVER	Get you with him you old dog

ADAM	Is old dog my reward? Most true I have lost my
	teeth in your service God be with my old master
	he would not have spoke such a word

	Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM

OLIVER	Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
	physic your rankness and yet give no thousand
	crowns neither Holla Dennis

	Enter DENNIS

DENNIS	Calls your worship?

OLIVER	Was not Charles the dukes wrestler here to speak with me?

DENNIS	So please you he is here at the door and importunes
	access to you

OLIVER	Call him in

	Exit DENNIS

	Twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is

	Enter CHARLES

CHARLES	Good morrow to your worship

OLIVER	Good Monsieur Charles whats the new news at the
	new court?

CHARLES	Theres no news at the court sir but the old news
	that is the old duke is banished by his younger
	brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
	have put themselves into voluntary exile with him
	whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
	therefore he gives them good leave to wander

OLIVER	Can you tell if Rosalind the dukes daughter be
	banished with her father?

CHARLES	O no for the dukes daughter her cousin so loves
	her being ever from their cradles bred together
	that she would have followed her exile or have died
	to stay behind her She is at the court and no
	less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
	never two ladies loved as they do

OLIVER	Where will the old duke live?

CHARLES	They say he is already in the forest of Arden and
	a many merry men with him and there they live like
	the old Robin Hood of England they say many young
	gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time
	carelessly as they did in the golden world

OLIVER	What you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?

CHARLES	Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a
	matter I am given sir secretly to understand
	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
	to come in disguised against me to try a fall
	Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that
	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
	well Your brother is but young and tender and
	for your love I would be loath to foil him as I
	must for my own honour if he come in therefore
	out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you
	withal that either you might stay him from his
	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
	run into in that it is a thing of his own search
	and altogether agaMESZ MG JAEX
