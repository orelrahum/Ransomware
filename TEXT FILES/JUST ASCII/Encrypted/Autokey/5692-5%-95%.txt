Man I deceived that which to me belongs
Is enmity which he will put between
Me and mankind I am to bruise his heel
His seed when is not set shall bruise my head
A world who would not purchase with a bruise
Or much more grievous pain?Ye have the account
Of my performance  What remains ye Gods
But up and enter now into full bliss?
So having said a while he stood expecting
Their universal shout and high applause
To fill his ear when contrary he hears
On all sides from innumerable tongues
A dismal universal hiss the sound
Of publick scorn he wondered but not long
Had leisure wondering at himself now more
His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare
His arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining
Each other till supplanted down he fell
A monstrous serpent on his belly prone
Reluctant but in vain a greater power
Now ruled him punished in the shape he sinned
According to his doom he would have spoke
But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
To forked tongue for now were all transformed
Alike to serpents all as accessories
To his bold riot  Dreadful was the din
Of hissing through the hall thick swarming now
With complicated monsters head and tail
Scorpion and Asp and Amphisbaena dire
Cerastes horned Hydrus and Elops drear
And Dipsas not so thick swarmed once the soil
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon or the isle
Ophiusa but still greatest he the midst
Now Dragon grown larger than whom the sun
Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime
Huge Python and his power no less he seemed
Above the rest still to retain they all
Him followed issuing forth to the open field
Where all yet left of that revolted rout
Heavenfallen in station stood or just array
Sublime with expectation when to see
In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief
They saw but other sight instead a croud
Of ugly serpents horrour on them fell
And horrid sympathy for what they saw
They felt themselves now changing down their arms
Down fell both spear and shield down they as fast
And the dire hiss renewed and the dire form
Catched by contagion like in punishment
As in their crime  Thus was the applause they meant
Turned to exploding hiss triumph to shame
Cast on themselves from their own mouths  There stood
A grove hard by sprung up with this their change
His will who reigns above to aggravate
Their penance laden with fair fruit like that
Which grew in Paradise the bait of Eve
Used by the Tempter on that prospect strange
Their earnest eyes they fixed imagining
For one forbidden tree a multitude
Now risen to work them further woe or shame
Yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce
Though to delude them sent could not abstain
But on they rolled in heaps and up the trees
Climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks
That curled Megaera greedily they plucked
The fruitage fair to sight like that which grew
Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed
This more delusive not the touch but taste
Deceived they fondly thinking to allay
Their appetite with gust instead of fruit
Chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste
With spattering noise rejected oft they assayed
Hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft
With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws
With soot and cinders filled so oft they fell
Into the same illusion not as Man
Whom they triumphed once lapsed  Thus were they plagued
And worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss
Till their lost shape permitted they resumed
Yearly enjoined some say to undergo
This annual humbling certain numbered days
To dash their pride and joy for Man seduced
However some tradition they dispersed
Among the Heathen of their purchase got
And fabled how the Serpent whom they called
Ophion with Eurynome the wide
Encroaching Eve perhaps had first the rule
Of high Olympus thence by Saturn driven
And Ops ere yet Dictaean Jove was born
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
Too soon arrived Sin there in power before
Once actual now in body and to dwell
Habitual habitant behind her Death
Close following pace for pace not mounted yet
On his pale horse to whom Sin thus began
Second of Satan sprung allconquering Death
What thinkest thou of our empire now though earned
With travel difficult not better far
Than still at Hells dark threshold to have sat watch
Unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved?
Whom thus the Sinborn monster answered soon
To me who with eternal famine pine
Alike is Hell or Paradise or Heaven
There best where most with ravine I may meet
Which here though plenteous all too little seems
To stuff this maw this vast unhidebound corps
To whom the incestuous mother thus replied
Thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flowers
Feed first on each beast next and fish and fowl
No homely morsels and whatever thing
The sithe of Time mows down devour unspared
Till I in Man residing through the race
His thoughts his looks words actions all infect
And season him thy last and sweetest prey
This said they both betook them several ways
Both to destroy or unimmortal make
All kinds and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later which the Almighty seeing
From his transcendent seat the Saints among
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice
See with what heat these dogs of Hell advance
To waste and havock yonder world which I
So fair and good created and had still
Kept in that state had not the folly of Man
Let in these wasteful furies who impute
Folly to me so doth the Prince of Hell
And his adherents that with so much ease
I suffer them to enter and possess
A place so heavenly and conniving seem
To gratify my scornful enemies
That laugh as if transported with some fit
Of passion I to them had quitted all
At random yielded up to their misrule
And know not that I called and drew them thither
My Hellhounds to lick up the draff and filth
Which Mans polluting sin with taint hath shed
On what was pure til crammed and gorged nigh burst
With sucked and glutted offal at one sling
Of thy victorious arm wellpleasing Son
Both Sin and Death and yawning Grave at last
Through Chaos hurled obstruct the mouth of Hell
For ever and seal up his ravenous jaws
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure
To sanctity that shall receive no stain
Till then the curse pronounced on both precedes
He ended and the heavenly audience loud
Sung Halleluiah as the sound of seas
Through multitude that sung  Just are thy ways
Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works
Who can extenuate thee?  Next to the Son
Destined Restorer of mankind by whom
New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise
Or down from Heaven descendSuch was their song
While the Creator calling forth by name
His mighty Angels gave them several charge
As sorted best with present things  The sun
Had first his precept so to move so shine
As might affect the earth with cold and heat
Scarce tolerable and from the north to call
Decrepit winter from the south to bring
Solstitial summers heat  To the blanc moon
Her office they prescribed to the other five
Their planetary motions and aspects
In sextile square and trine and opposite
Of noxious efficacy and when to join
In synod unbenign and taught the fixed
Their influence malignant when to shower
Which of them rising with the sun or falling
Should prove tempestuous  To the winds they set
Their corners when with bluster to confound
Sea air and shore the thunder when to roll
With terrour through the dark aereal hall
Some say he bid his Angels turn ascanse
The poles of earth twice ten degrees and more
From the suns axle they with labour pushed
Oblique the centrick globe  Some say the sun
Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven
Atlantick Sisters and the Spartan Twins
Up to the Tropick Crab thence down amain
By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales
As deep as Capricorn to bring in change
Of seasons to each clime else had the spring
Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers
Equal in days and nights except to those
Beyond the polar circles to them day
Had unbenighted shone while the low sun
To recompense his distance in their sight
Had rounded still the horizon and not known
Or east or west which had forbid the snow
From cold Estotiland and south as far
Beneath Magellan  At that tasted fruit
The sun as from Thyestean banquet turned
His course intended else how had the world
Inhabited though sinless more than now
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?
These changes in the Heavens though slow produced
Like change on sea and land sideral blast
Vapour and mist and exhalation hot
Corrupt and pestilent  Now from the north
Of Norumbega and the Samoed shore
Bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice
And snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw
Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud
And Thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn
With adverse blast upturns them from the south
Notus and Afer black with thunderous clouds
From Serraliona thwart of these as fierce
Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds
Eurus and Zephyr with their lateral noise
Sirocco and Libecchio  Thus began
Outrage from lifeless things but Discord first
Daughter of Sin among the irrational
Death introduced through fierce antipathy
Beast now with beast gan war and fowl with fowl
And fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving
Devoured each other nor stood much in awe
Of Man but fled him or with countenance grim
Glared on him passing  These were from without
The growing miseries which Adam saw
Already in part though hid in gloomiest shade
To sorrow abandoned but worse felt within
And in a troubled sea of passion tost
Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint
O miserable of happy  Is this the end
Of this new glorious world and me so late
The glory of that glory who now become
Accursed of blessed? hide me from the face
Of God whom to behold was then my highth
Of happinessYet well if here would end
The misery I deserved it and would bear
My own deservings but this will not serve
All that I eat or drink or shall beget
Is propagated curse  O voice once heard
Delightfully Encrease and multiply
Now death to hear for what can I encrease
Or multiply but curses on my head?
Who of all ages to succeed but feeling
The evil on him brought by me will curse
My head?  Ill fare our ancestor impure
For this we may thank Adam but his thanks
Shall be the execration so besides
Mine own that bide upon me all from me
Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound
On me as on their natural center light
Heavy though in their place  O fleeting joys
Of Paradise dear bought with lasting woes
Did I request thee Maker from my clay
To mould me Man? did I solicit thee
From darkness to promote me or here place
In this delicious garden?  As my will
Concurred not to my being it were but right
And equal to reduce me to my dust
Desirous to resign and render back
All I received unable to perform
Thy terms too hard by which I was to hold
The good I sought not  To the loss of that
Sufficient penalty why hast thou added
The sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable
Why am I mocked with death and lengthened out
To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet
Mortality my sentence and be earth
Insensible  How glad would lay me down
As in my mothers lap  There I should rest
And sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
Would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
To me and to my offspring would torment me
With cruel expectation  Yet one doubt
Pursues me still lest all I cannot die
Lest that pure breath of life the spirit of Man
Which God inspired cannot together perish
With this corporeal clod then in the grave
Or in some other dismal place who knows
But I shall die a living death?  O thought
Horrid if true  Yet why? It was but breath
Of life that sinned what dies but what had life
And sin?  The body properly had neither
All of me then shall die let this appease
The doubt since human reach no further knows
For though the Lord of all be infinite
Is his wrath also?  Be it Man is not so
But mortal doomed  How can he exercise
Wrath without end on Man whom death must end?
Can he make deathless death?  That were to make
Strange contradiction which to God himself
Impossible is held as argument
Of weakness not of power  Will he draw out
For angers sake finite to infinite
In punished Man to satisfy his rigour
Satisfied never?  That were to extend
His sentence beyond dust and Natures law
By which all causes else according still
To the reception of their matter act
Not to the extent of their own sphere  But say
That death be not one stroke as I supposed
Bereaving sense but endless misery
From this day onward which I feel begun
Both in me and without me and so last
To perpetuityAy methat fear
Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution
On my defenceless head both Death and I
Am found eternal and incorporate both
Nor I on my part single in me all
Posterity stands cursed  Fair patrimony
That I must leave ye Sons  O were I able
To waste it all myself and leave ye none
So disinherited how would you bless
Me now your curse  Ah why should all mankind
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemned
It guiltless?  But from me what can proceed
But all corrupt both mind and will depraved
Not to do only but to will the same
With me?  How can they then acquitted stand
In sight of God?  Him after all disputes
Forced I absolve all my evasions vain
And reasonings though through mazes lead me still
But to my own conviction first and last
On me me only as the source and spring
Of all corruption all the blame lights due
So might the wrath  Fond wishcouldst thou support
That burden heavier than the earth to bear
Than all the world much heavier though divided
With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desirest
And what thou fearest alike destroys alZ FGPP
