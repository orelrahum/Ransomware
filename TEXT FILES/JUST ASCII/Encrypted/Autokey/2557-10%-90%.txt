Iraq Economy

Overview
    The Bathist regime engages in extensive central planning and management of
    industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some smallscale
    industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise The
    economy has been dominated by the oil sector which has provided about 
    of foreign exchange earnings In the s financial problems caused by
    massive expenditures in the eightyear war with Iran and damage to oil
    export facilities by Iran led the government to implement austerity
    measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments
    After the end of hostilities in  oil exports gradually increased with
    the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities
    Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages salinization
    and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization
    programs The industrial sector although accorded high priority by the
    government also was under financial constraints Iraqs seizure of Kuwait
    in August  subsequent international economic embargoes and military
    actions by an international coalition beginning in January  drastically
    changed the economic picture Oil exports were cut to near zero and
    industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged Throughout
     the UNs economic embargo worked to reduce exports and imports and to
    increase prices for most goods The governments policy to allocate goods to
    key supporters of the regime exacerbated shortages

Israel Economy

Overview
    Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation It
    depends on imports of crude oil grains raw materials and military
    equipment Despite limited natural resources Israel has intensively
    developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past  years
    Industry employs about  of Israeli workers agriculture  and services
    most of the rest Diamonds hightechnology equipment and agricultural
    products fruits and vegetables are leading exports Israel usually posts
    balanceofpayments deficits which are covered by large transfer payments
    from abroad and by foreign loans Roughly half of the governments 
    billion external debt is owed to the United States which is its major
    source of economic and military aid To earn needed foreign exchange Israel
    has been targeting hightechnology niches in international markets such as
    medical scanning equipment Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in August  dealt a
    blow to Israels economy Higher world oil prices added an estimated 
    million to the oil import bill that year and helped keep annual inflation at
     Regional tension and the continuing Palestinian uprising intifadah
    have contributed to a sharp drop in tourism  a key foreign exchange earner
     to the lowest level since the  ArabIsraeli war The influx of Jewish
    immigrants from the former USSR which topped  during the period
     will increase unemployment intensify housing problems widen the
