Each stair mysteriously was meant nor stood
There always but drawn up to Heaven sometimes
Viewless and underneath a bright sea flowed
Of jasper or of liquid pearl whereon
Who after came from earth failing arrived
Wafted by Angels or flew oer the lake
Rapt in a chariot drawn by fiery steeds
The stairs were then let down whether to dare
The Fiend by easy ascent or aggravate
His sad exclusion from the doors of bliss
Direct against which opened from beneath
Just oer the blissful seat of Paradise
A passage down to the Earth a passage wide
Wider by far than that of aftertimes
Over mount Sion and though that were large
Over the Promised Land to God so dear
By which to visit oft those happy tribes
On high behests his angels to and fro
Passed frequent and his eye with choice regard
From Paneas the fount of Jordans flood
To Beersaba where the Holy Land
Borders on Egypt and the Arabian shore
So wide the opening seemed where bounds were set
To darkness such as bound the ocean wave
Satan from hence now on the lower stair
That scaled by steps of gold to Heavengate
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this world at once  As when a scout
Through dark?nd desart ways with?oeril gone
All?might?t?kast by break of cheerful dawn
Obtains the brow of some highclimbing hill
Which to his eye discovers unaware
The goodly prospect of some foreign land
First seen or some renowned metropolis
With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned
Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams
Such wonder seised though after Heaven seen
The Spirit malign but much more envy seised
At sight of all this world beheld so fair
Round he surveys and well might where he stood
So high above the circling canopy
Of nights extended shade from eastern point
Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears
Andromeda far off Atlantick seas
Beyond the horizon then from pole to pole
He views in breadth and without longer pause
Down right into the worlds first region throws
His flight precipitant and winds with ease
Through the pure marble air his oblique way
Amongst innumerable stars that shone
Stars distant but nigh hand seemed other worlds
Or other worlds they seemed or happy isles
Like those Hesperian gardens famed of old
Fortunate fields and groves and flowery vales
Thrice happy isles but who dwelt happy there
He staid not to inquire  Above them all
The golden sun in splendour likest Heaven
Allured his eye thither his course he bends
Through the calm firmament but up or down
By center or eccentrick hard to tell
Or longitude where the great luminary
Aloof the vulgar constellations thick
That from his lordly eye keep distance due
Dispenses light from far they as they move
Their starry dance in numbers that compute
Days months and years towards his allcheering lamp
Turn swift their various motions or are turned
By his magnetick beam that gently warms
The universe and to each inward part
With gentle penetration though unseen
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep
So wonderously was set his station bright
There lands the Fiend a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the suns lucent orb
Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw
The place he found beyond expression bright
Compared with aught on earth metal or stone
Not all parts like but all alike informed
With radiant light as glowing iron with fire
If metal part seemed gold part silver clear
If stone carbuncle most or chrysolite
Ruby or topaz to the twelve that shone
In Aarons breastplate and a stone besides
Imagined rather oft than elsewhere seen
That stone or like to that which here below
Philosophers in vain so long have sought
In vain though by their powerful art they bind
Volatile Hermes and call up unbound
In various shapes old Proteus from the sea
Drained through a limbeck to his native form
What wonder then if fields and regions here
Breathe forth Elixir pure and rivers run
Potable gold when with one virtuous touch
The archchemick sun so far from us remote
Produces with terrestrial humour mixed
Here in the dark so many precious things
Of colour glorious and effect so rare?
Here matter new to gaze the Devil met
Undazzled far and wide his eye commands
For sight no obstacle found here nor shade
But all sunshine as when his beams at noon
Culminate from the equator as they now
Shot upward still direct whence no way round
Shadow from body opaque can fall and the air
No where so clear sharpened his visual ray
To objects distant far whereby he soon
Saw within ken a glorious Angel stand
The same whom John saw also in the sun
His back was turned but not his brightness hid
Of beaming sunny rays a golden tiar
Circled his head nor less his locks behind
Illustrious on his shoulders fledge with wings
Lay waving round on some great charge employed
He seemed or fixed in cogitation deep
Glad was the Spirit impure as now in hope
To find who might direct his wandering flight
To Paradise the happy seat of Man
His journeys end and our beginning woe
But first he casts to change his proper shape
Which else might work him danger or delay
And now a stripling Cherub he appears
Not of the prime yet such as in his face
Youth smiled celestial and to every limb
Suitable grace diffused so well he feigned
Under a coronet his flowing hair
In curls on either cheek played wings he wore
Of many a coloured plume sprinkled with gold
His habit fit for speed succinct and held
Before his decent steps a silver wand
He drew not nigh unheard the Angel bright
Ere he drew nigh his radiant visage turned
Admonished by his ear and straight was known
The ArchAngel Uriel one of the seven
Who in Gods presence nearest to his throne
Stand ready at command and are his eyes
That run through all the Heavens or down to the Earth
Bear his swift errands over moist and dry
Oer sea and land him Satan thus accosts
Uriel for thou of those seven Spirits that stand
In sight of Gods high throne gloriously bright
The first art wont his great authentick will
Interpreter through highest Heaven to bring
Where all his sons thy embassy attend
And here art likeliest by supreme decree
Like honour to obtain and as his eye
To visit oft this new creation round
Unspeakable desire to see and know
All these his wonderous works but chiefly Man
His chief delight and favour him for whom
All these his works so wonderous he ordained
Hath brought me from the quires of Cherubim
Alone thus wandering  Brightest Seraph tell
In which of all these shining orbs hath Man
His fixed seat or fixed seat hath none
But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell
That I may find him and with secret gaze
Or open admiration him behold
On whom the great Creator hath bestowed
Worlds and on whom hath all these graces poured
That both in him and all things as is meet
The universal Maker we may praise
Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
To deepest Hell and to repair that loss
Created this new happy race of Men
To serve him better  Wise are all his ways
So spake the false dissembler unperceived
For neither Man nor Angel can discern
Hypocrisy the only evil that walks
Invisible except to God alone
By his permissive will through Heaven and Earth
And oft though wisdom wake suspicion sleeps
At wisdoms gate and to simplicity
Resigns her charge while goodness thinks no ill
Where no ill seems  Which now for once beguiled
Uriel though regent of the sun and held
The sharpestsighted Spirit of all in Heaven
Who to the fraudulent impostor foul
In his uprightness answer thus returned
Fair Angel thy desire which tends to know
The works of God thereby to glorify
The great Workmaster leads to no excess
That reaches blame but rather merits praise
The more it seems excess that led thee hither
From thy empyreal mansion thus alone
To witness with thine eyes what some perhaps
Contented with report hear only in Heaven
For wonderful indeed are all his works
Pleasant to know and worthiest to be all
Had in remembrance always with delight
But what created mind can comprehend
Their number or the wisdom infinite
That brought them forth but hid their causes deep?
I saw when at his word the formless mass
This worlds material mould came to a heap
Confusion heard his voice and wild uproar
Stood ruled stood vast infinitude confined
Till at his second bidding Darkness fled
Light shone and order from disorder sprung
Swift to their several quarters hasted then
The cumbrous elements earth flood air fire
And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven
Flew upward spirited with various forms
That rolled orbicular and turned to stars
Numberless as thou seest and how they move
Each had his place appointed each his course
The rest in circuit walls this universe
Look downward on that globe whose hither side
With light from hence though but reflected shines
That place is Earth the seat of Man that light
His day which else as the other hemisphere
Night would invade but there the neighbouring moon
So call that opposite fair star her aid
Timely interposes and her monthly round
Still ending still renewing through mid Heaven
With borrowed light her countenance triform
Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth
And in her pale dominion checks the night
That spot to which I point is Paradise
Adams abode those lofty shades his bower
Thy way thou canst not miss me mine requires
Thus said he turned and Satan bowing low
As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven
Where honour due and reverence none neglects
Took leave and toward the coast of earth beneath
Down from the ecliptick sped with hoped success
Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel
Nor staid till on Niphates top he lights



Book IV


O for that warning voice which he who saw
The Apocalypse heard cry in Heaven aloud
Then when the Dragon put to second rout
Came furious down to be revenged on men
Woe to the inhabitants on earth that now
While time was our first parents had been warned
The coming of their secret foe and scaped
Haply so scaped his mortal snare  For now
Satan now first inflamed with rage came down
The tempter ere the accuser of mankind
To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss
Of that first battle and his flight to Hell
Yet not rejoicing in his speed though bold
Far off and fearless nor with cause to boast
Begins his dire attempt which nigh the birth
Now rolling boils in his tumultuous breast
And like a devilish engine back recoils
Upon himself horrour and doubt distract
His troubled thoughts and from the bottom stir
The Hell within him for within him Hell
He brings and round about him nor from Hell
One step no more than from himself can fly
By change of place  Now conscience wakes despair
That slumbered wakes the bitter memory
Of what he was what is and what must be
Worse of worse deeds worse sufferings must ensue
Sometimes towards Eden which now in his view
Lay pleasant his grieved look he fixes sad
Sometimes towards Heaven and the fullblazing sun
Which now sat high in his meridian tower
Then much revolving thus in sighs began
O thou that with surpassing glory crowned
Lookest from thy sole dominion like the God
Of this new world at whose sight all the stars
Hide their diminished heads to thee I call
But with no friendly voice and add thy name
Of Sun to tell thee how I hate thy beams
That bring to my remembrance from what state
I fell how glorious once above thy sphere
Till pride and worse ambition threw me down
Warring in Heaven against Heavens matchless King
Ah wherefore he deserved no such return
From me whom he created what I was
In that bright eminence and with his good
Upbraided none nor was his service hard
What could be less than to afford him praise
The easiest recompence and pay him thanks
How due yet all his good proved ill in me
And wrought but malice lifted up so high
I sdeined subjection and thought one step higher
Would set me highest and in a moment quit
The debt immense of endless gratitude
So burdensome still paying still to owe
Forgetful what from him I still received
And understood not that a grateful mind
By owing owes not but still pays at once
Indebted and discharged what burden then
O had his powerful destiny ordained
Me some inferiour Angel I had stood
Then happy no unbounded hope had raised
Ambition  Yet why not some other Power
As great might have aspired and me though mean
Drawn to his part but other Powers as great
Fell not but stand unshaken from within
Or from without to all temptations armed
Hadst thou the same free will and power to stand?
Thou hadst whom hast thou then or what to accuse
But Heavens free love dealt equally to all?
Be then his love accursed since love or hate
To me alike it deals eternal woe
Nay cursed be thou since against his thy will
Chose freely what it now so justly rues
Me miserable which way shall I fly
Infinite wrath and infinite despair?
Which way I fly is Hell myself am Hell
And in the lowest deep a lower deep
Still threatening to devour me opens wide
To which the Hell I suffer seems a Heaven
O then at last relent  Is there no place
Left for repentance none for pardon left?
None left but by submission and that word
Disdain forbids me and my dread of shame
Among the Spirits beneath whom I seduced
With other promises and other vaunts
Than to submit boasting I could subdue
The Omnipotent  Ay me they little know
How dearly I abide that boast so vain
Under what torments inwardly I groan
While they adore me on the throne of Hell
With diadem and scepter high advanced
The lower still I fall only supreme
In misery  Such joy ambition finds
But say I could repent and could obtain
By act of grace my former state how soon
Would highth recall high thoughts how soon unsay
What feigned submission swore?  Ease would recant
Vows made in pain as violent and void
For never can true reconcilement grow
Where wounds of deadly hate have pierced so deep
Which would but lead me to a worse relapse
And heavier fall  so should I purchase dear
Short intermission bought with double smart
This knows my Punisher therefore as far
From granting he as I from begging peace
All hope excluded thus behold in stead
Mankind created and for him this world
So farewell hope and with hope farewell fear
Farewell remorse all good to me is lost
Evil be thou my good by thee at least
Divided empire with Heavens King I hold
By thee and more than half perhaps will reign
As Man ere long and this new world shall know
Thus while he spake each passion dimmed his face
Thrice changed with pale ire envy and despair
Which marred his borrowed visage and betrayed
Him counterfeit if any eye beheld
For heavenly minds from such distempers foul
Are ever clear  Whereof he soon aware
Each perturbation smoothed with outward calm
Artificer of fraud and was the first
That practised falsehood under saintly show
Deep malice to conceal couched with revenge
Yet not enough had practised to deceive
Uriel once warned whose eye pursued him down
 The way he went and on the Assyrian mount
 Saw him disfigured more than could befall
 Spirit of happy sort his gestures fierce
 He marked and mad demeanour then alone
 As he supposed all unobserved unseen
 So on he fares and to the border comes
 Of Eden where delicious Paradise
 Now nearer crowns with her enclosure green
 As with a rural mound the champaign head
 Of a steep wilderness whose hairy sides
Access denied and overhead upgrew
 Insuperable height of loftiest shade
 Cedar and pine and fir and branching palm
 A sylvan scene and as the ranks ascend
 Shade above shade a woody theatre
 Of stateliest view Yet higher than their tops
 The verdurous wall of Paradise upsprung

    
Which to our general sire gave prospect large
Into his nether empire neighbouring round
And higher than that wall a circling row
Of goodliest trees loaden with fairest fruit
Blossoms and fruits at once of golden hue
Appeared with gay enamelled colours mixed
On which the sun more glad impressed his beams
Than in fair evening cloud or humid bow
When God hath showered the eaKAL WO CHCWZJ GZIXCV
