ACT II



SCENE III	Before OLIVERS house


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM meeting

ORLANDO	Whos there?

ADAM	What my young master? O my gentle master
	O my sweet master O you memory
	Of old Sir Rowland why what make you here?
	Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
	And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant?
	Why would you be so fond to overcome
	The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
	Your praise is come too swiftly home before you
	Know you not master to some kind of men
	Their graces serve them but as enemies?
	No more do yours your virtues gentle master
	Are sanctified and holy traitors to you
	O what a world is this when what is comely
	Envenoms him that bears it

ORLANDO	Why whats the matter?

ADAM	O unhappy youth
	Come not within these doors within this roof
	The enemy of all your graces lives
	Your brotherno no brother yet the son
	Yet not the son I will not call him son
	Of him I was about to call his father
	Hath heard your praises and this night he means
	To burn the lodging where you use to lie
	And you within it if he fail of that
	He will have other means to cut you off
	I overheard him and his practises
	This is no place this house is but a butchery
	Abhor it fear it do not enter it

ORLANDO	Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go?

ADAM	No matter whither so you come not here

ORLANDO	What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
	Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
	A thievish living on the common road?
	This I must do or know not what to do
	Yet this I will not do do how I can
	I rather will subject me to the malice
	Of a diverted blood and bloody brother

ADAM	But do not so I have five hundred crowns
	The thrifty hire I saved under your father
	Which I did store to be my fosternurse
	When service should in my old limbs lie lame
