Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds
Eurus and Zephyr with their lateral noise
Sirocco and Libecchio  Thus began
Outrage from lifeless things but Discord first
Daughter of Sin among the irrational
Death introduced through fierce antipathy
Beast now with beast gan war and fowl with fowl
And fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving
Devoured each other nor stood much in awe
Of Man but fled him or with countenance grim
Glared on him passing  These were from without
The growing miseries which Adam saw
Already in part though hid in gloomiest shade
To sorrow abandoned but worse felt within
And in a troubled sea of passion tost
Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint
O miserable of happy  Is this the end
Of this new glorious world and me so late
The glory of that glory who now become
Accursed of blessed? hide me from the face
Of God whom to behold was then my highth
Of happinessYet well if here would end
The misery I deserved it and would bear
My own deservings but this will not serve
All that I eat or drink or shall beget
Is propagated curse  O voice once heard
Delightfully Encrease and multiply
Now death to hear for what can I encrease
Or multiply but curses on my head?
Who of all ages to succeed but feeling
The evil on him brought by me will curse
My head?  Ill fare our ancestor impure
For this we may thank Adam but his thanks
Shall be the execration so besides
Mine own that bide upon me all from me
Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound
On me as on their natural center light
Heavy though in their place  O fleeting joys
Of Paradise dear bought with lasting woes
Did I request thee Maker from my clay
To mould me Man? did I solicit thee
From darkness to promote me or here place
In this delicious garden?  As my will
Concurred not to my being it were but right
And equal to reduce me to my dust
Desirous to resign and render back
All I received unable to perform
Thy terms too hard by which I was to hold
The good I sought not  To the loss of that
Sufficient penalty why hast thou added
The sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable
Why am I mocked with death and lengthened out
To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet
Mortality my sentence and be earth
Insensible  How glad would lay me down
As in my mothers lap  There I should rest
And sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
Would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
To me and to my offspring would torment me
With cruel expectation  Yet one doubt
Pursues me still lest all I cannot die
Lest that pure breath of life the spirit of Man
Which God inspired cannot together perish
With this corporeal clod then in the grave
Or in some other dismal place who knows
But I shall die a living death?  O thought
Horrid if true  Yet why? It was but breath
Of life that sinned what dies but what had life
And sin?  The body properly had neither
All of me then shall die let this appease
The doubt since human reach no further BGVAJ
