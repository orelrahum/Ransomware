  What a curious feeling said Alice I must be shutting up
like a telescope

  And so it was indeed  she was now only ten inches high and
her face brightened up at the thought that she was now the right
size for going though the little door into that lovely garden
First however she waited for a few minutes to see if she was
going to shrink any further  she felt a little nervous about
this for it might end you know said Alice to herself in my
going out altogether like a candle  I wonder what I should be
like then?  And she tried to fancy what the flame of a candle is
like after the candle is blown out for she could not remember
ever having seen such a thing

  After a while finding that nothing more happened she decided
on going into the garden at once but alas for poor Alice when
she got to the door she found he had forgotten the little golden
key and when she went back to the table for it she found she
could not possibly reach it  she could see it quite plainly
through the glass and she tried her best to climb up one of the
legs of the table but it was too slippery and when she had
tired herself out with trying the poor little thing sat down and
cried

  Come theres no use in crying like that said Alice to
herself rather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute
She generally gave herself very good advice though she very
seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so
severely as to bring tears into her eyes and once she remembered
trying to box her own ears for having cheated herself in a game
of croquet she was playing against herself for this curious
child was very fond of pretending to be two people  But its no
use now thought poor Alice to pretend to be two people  Why
theres hardly enough of me left to make ONE respectable
person

  Soon her eye fell on a little glass box that was lying under
the table  she opened it and found in it a very small cake on
which the words EAT ME were beautifully marked in currants
Well Ill eat it said Alice and if it makes me grow larger
I can reach the key and if it makes me grow smaller I can creep
under the door so either way Ill get into the garden and I
dont care which happens

  She ate a little bit and said anxiously to herself Which
way?  Which way? holding her hand on the top of her head to
feel which way it was growing and she was quite surprised to
find that she remained the same size  to be sure this generally
happens when one eats cake but Alice had got so much into the
way of expecting nothing but outoftheway things to happen
that it seemed quite dull and stupid for life to go on in the
common way

  So she set to work and very soon finished off the cake

                                               

                                            

                                               




                           CHAPTER II

                        The Pool of Tears


  Curiouser and curiouser cried Alice she was so much
surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good
English now Im opening out like the largest telescope that
ever was  Goodbye feet for when she looked down at her
feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so
far off  Oh my poor little feet I wonder who will put on
your shoes and stockings for you now dears?  Im sure I shant
be able  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
about you  you must manage the best way you can but I must be
kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they wont walk the
way I want to go  Let me see  Ill give them a new pair of
boots every Christmas

  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it
They must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll
seem sending presents to ones own feet  And how odd the
directions will look

            ALICES RIGHT FOOT ESQ
                HEARTHRUG
                    NEAR THE FENDER
                        WITH ALICES LOVE

Oh dear what nonsense Im talking

  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in
fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door

  Poor Alice  It was as much as she could do lying down on one
side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get
through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to
cry again

  You ought to be ashamed of yourself said Alice a great
girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in
this way  Stop this moment I tell you  But she went on all
the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool
all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the
hall

  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the
distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
It was the White Rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
other  he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to
himself as he came Oh the Duchess the Duchess Oh wont she
be savage if Ive kept her waiting  Alice felt so desperate
that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the Rabbit
came near her she began in a low timid voice If you please
sir  The Rabbit started violently dropped the white kid
gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard
as he could go

  Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very
hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking
Dear dear  How queer everything is today  And yesterday
things went on just as usual  I wonder if Ive been changed in
the night?  Let me think  was I the same when I got up this
morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little
different  But if Im not the same the next question is Who in
the world am I?  Ah THATS the great puzzle  And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of
them

  Im sure Im not Ada she said for her hair goes in such
long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and Im
sure I cant be Mabel for I know all sorts of things and she
oh she knows such a very little  Besides SHES she and Im I
andoh dear how puzzling it all is  Ill try if I know all the
things I used to know  Let me see  four times five is twelve
and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear
I shall never get to twenty at that rate  However the
Multiplication Table doesnt signify  lets try Geography
London is the capital of Paris and Paris is the capital of Rome
and Romeno THATS all wrong Im certain  I must have been
changed for Mabel  Ill try and say "How doth the little"
and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons
and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and
strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do

            How doth the little crocodile
              Improve his shining tail
            And pour the waters of the Nile
              On every golden scale

            How cheerfully he seems to grin
              How neatly spread his claws
            And welcome little fishes in
              With gently smiling jaws

  Im sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on I must be Mabel
after all and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so
many lessons to learn  No Ive made up my mind about it if Im
Mabel Ill stay down here  Itll be no use their putting their
heads down and saying "Come up again dear"  I shall only look
up and say "Who am I then?  Tell me that first and then if I
like being that person Ill come up  if not Ill stay down
here till Im somebody else"but oh dear cried Alice with a
sudden burst of tears I do wish they WOULD put their heads
down  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here

  As she said this she looked down at her hands and was
surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbits little
white kid gloves while she was talking  How CAN I have done
that? she thought  I must be growing small again  She got up
and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that
as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high
and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found out that the
cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it
hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether

That WAS a narrow escape said Alice a good deal frightened at
the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in
existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed
back to the little door  but alas the little door was shut
again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child
for I never was so small as this before never  And I declare
its too bad that it is

  As she said these words her foot slipped and in another
moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water  He first
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that
case I can go back by railway she said to herself  Alice had
been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general
conclusion that wherever you go to on the English coast you find
a number of bathing machines in the sea sSEI CZWXHTLV OLXKVQO OT
