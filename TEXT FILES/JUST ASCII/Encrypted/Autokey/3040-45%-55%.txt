ACT IV



SCENE I	The forest


	Enter ROSALIND CELIA and JAQUES

JAQUES	I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted
	with thee

ROSALIND	They say you are a melancholy fellow

JAQUES	I am so I do love it better than laughing

ROSALIND	Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
	fellows and betray themselves to every modern
	censure worse than drunkards

JAQUES	Why tis good to be sad and say nothing

ROSALIND	Why then tis good to be a post

JAQUES	I have neither the scholars melancholy which is
	emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical
	nor the courtiers which is proud nor the
	soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers
	which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor
	the lovers which is all these but it is a
	melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples
	extracted from many objects and indeed the sundrys
	contemplation of my travels in which my often
	rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness

ROSALIND	A traveller By my faith you have great reason to
	be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see
	other mens then to have seen much and to have
	nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands

JAQUES	Yes I have gained my experience

ROSALIND	And your experience makes you sad I had rather have
	a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
	sad and to travel for it too

	Enter ORLANDO

ORLANDO	Good day and happiness dear Rosalind

JAQUES	Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse

	Exit

ROSALIND	Farewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and
	wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your
	own country be out of love with your nativity and
	almost chide God for making you that countenance you
	are or I will scarce think you have swam in a
	gondola Why how now Orlando where have you been
	all this while? You a lover An you serve me such
	another trick never come in my sight more

ORLANDO	My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise

ROSALIND	Break an hours promise in love He that will
	divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
	a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
	affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid
	hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant
	him heartwhole

ORLANDO	Pardon me dear Rosalind

ROSALIND	Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I
	had as lief be wooed of a snail

ORLANDO	Of a snail?

ROSALIND	Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he
	carries his house on his head a better jointure
	I think than you make a woman besides he brings
	his destiny with him

ORLANDO	Whats that?

ROSALIND	Why horns which such as you are fain to be
	beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in
	his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife

ORLANDO	Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous

ROSALIND	And I am your Rosalind

CELIA	It pleases him to call you so but he hath a
	Rosalind of a better leer than you

ROSALIND	Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday
	humour and like enough to consent What would you
	say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I would kiss before I spoke

ROSALIND	Nay you were better speak first and when you were
	gravelled for lack of matter you might take
	occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are
	out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod
	warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss

ORLANDO	How if the kiss be denied?

ROSALIND	Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter

ORLANDO	Who could be out being before his beloved mistress?

ROSALIND	Marry that should you if I were your mistress or
	I should think my honesty ranker than my wit

ORLANDO	What of my suit?

ROSALIND	Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
	Am not I your Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I take some joy to say you are because I would be
	talking of her

ROSALIND	Well in her person I say I will not have you

ORLANDO	Then in mine own person I die

ROSALIND	No faith die by attorney The poor world is
	almost six thousand years old and in all this time
	there was not any man died in his own person
	videlicit in a lovecause Troilus had his brains
	dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he
	could to die before and he is one of the patterns
	of love Leander he would have lived many a fair
	year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been
	for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
	but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
	taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
	coroners of that age found it was Hero of Sestos
	But these are all lies men have died from time to
	time and worms have eaten them but not for love

ORLANDO	I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind
	for I protest her frown might kill me

ROSALIND	By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now
	I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon
	disposition and ask me what you will I will grant
	it

ORLANDO	Then love me Rosalind

ROSALIND	Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all

ORLANDO	And wilt thou have me?

ROSALIND	Ay and twenty such

ORLANDO	What sayest thou?

ROSALIND	Are you not good?

ORLANDO	I hope so

ROSALIND	Why then can one desire too much of a good thing?
	Come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
	Give me your hand Orlando What do you say sister?

ORLANDO	Pray thee marry us

CELIA	I cannot say the words

ROSALIND	You must begin Will you Orlando

CELIA	Go to Will you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I will

ROSALIND	Ay but when?

ORLANDO	Why now as fast as she can marry us

ROSALIND	Then you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife

ORLANDO	I take thee Rosalind for wife

ROSALIND	I might ask you for your commission but I do take
	thee Orlando for my husband theres a girl goes
	before the priest and certainly a womans thought
	runs before her actions

ORLANDO	So do all thoughts they are winged

ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her after you
	have possessed her

ORLANDO	For ever and a day

ROSALIND	Say a day without the ever No no Orlando
	men are April when they woo December when they wed
	maids are May when they are maids but the sky
	changes when they are wives I will be more jealous
	of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen
	more clamorous than a parrot against rain more
	newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires
	than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana
	in the fountain and I will do that when you are
	disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyen and
	that when thou art inclined to sleep

ORLANDO	But will my Rosalind do so?

ROSALIND	By my life she will do as I do

ORLANDO	O but she is wise

ROSALIND	Or else she could not have the wit to do this the
	wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans
	wit and it will out at the casement shut that and
	twill out at the keyhole stop that twill fly
	with the smoke out at the chimney

ORLANDO	A man that had a wife with such a wit he might say
	Wit whither wilt?

ROSALIND	Nay you might keep that cheque for it till you met
	your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed

ORLANDO	And what wit could wit have to excuse that?

ROSALIND	Marry to say she came to seek you there You shall
	never take her without her answer unless you take
	her without her tongue O that woman that cannot
	make her fault her husbands occasion let her
	never nurse her child herself for she will breed
	it like a fool

ORLANDO	For these two hours Rosalind I will leave thee

ROSALIND	Alas dear love I cannot lack thee two hours

ORLANDO	I must attend the duke at dinner by two oclock I
	will be with thee again

ROSALIND	Ay go your ways go your ways I knew what you
	would prove my friends told me as much and I
	thought no less that flattering tongue of yours
	won me tis but one cast away and so come
	death Two oclock is your hour?

ORLANDO	Ay sweet Rosalind

ROSALIND	By my troth and in good earnest and so God mend
	me and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous
	if you break one jot of your promise or come one
	minute behind your hour I will think you the most
	pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover
	and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
	may be chosen out of the gross band of the
	unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep
	your promise

ORLANDO	With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
	Rosalind so adieu

ROSALIND	Well Time is the old justice that examines all such
	offenders and let Time try adieu

	Exit ORLANDO

CELIA	You have simply misused our sex in your loveprate
	we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
	head and show the world what the bird hath done to
	her own nest

ROSALIND	O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou
	didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But
	it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown
	bottom like the bay of Portugal

CELIA	Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour
	affection in it runs out

ROSALIND	No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
	of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness
	that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes
	because his own are out let him be judge how deep I
	am in love Ill tell thee Aliena I cannot be out
	of the sight of Orlando Ill go find a shadow and
	sigh till he come

CELIA	And Ill sleep

	Exeunt
