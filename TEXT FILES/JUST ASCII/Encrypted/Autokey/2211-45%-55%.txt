With suppliant knee and deify his power
Who from the terror of this arm so late
Doubted his empirethat were low indeed
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
This downfall since by fate the strength of Gods
And this empyreal sybstance cannot fail
Since through experience of this great event
In arms not worse in foresight much advanced
We may with more successful hope resolve
To wage by force or guile eternal war
Irreconcilable to our grand Foe
Who now triumphs and in th excess of joy
Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven"
  So spake th apostate Angel though in pain
Vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair
And him thus answered soon his bold compeer
  "O Prince O Chief of many throned Powers
That led th embattled Seraphim to war
Under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds
Fearless endangered Heavens perpetual King
And put to proof his high supremacy
Whether upheld by strength or chance or fate
Too well I see and rue the dire event
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
Hath lost us Heaven and all this mighty host
In horrible destruction laid thus low
As far as Gods and heavenly Essences
Can perish for the mind and spirit remains
Invincible and vigour soon returns
Though all our glory extinct and happy state
Here swallowed up in endless misery
But what if he our Conqueror whom I now
Of force believe almighty since no less
Than such could have oerpowered such force as ours
Have left us this our spirit and strength entire
Strongly to suffer and support our pains
That we may so suffice his vengeful ire
Or do him mightier service as his thralls
By right of war whateer his business be
Here in the heart of Hell to work in fire
Or do his errands in the gloomy Deep?
What can it the avail though yet we feel
Strength undiminished or eternal being
To undergo eternal punishment?"
  Whereto with speedy words th ArchFiend replied
"Fallen Cherub to be weak is miserable
Doing or suffering but of this be sure
To do aught good never will be our task
But ever to do ill our sole delight
As being the contrary to his high will
Whom we resist If then his providence
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good
Our labour must be to pervert that end
And out of good still to find means of evil
Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps
Shall grieve him if I fail not and disturb
His inmost counsels from their destined aim
But see the angry Victor hath recalled
His ministers of vengeance and pursuit
Back to the gates of Heaven the sulphurous hail
Shot after us in storm oerblown hath laid
The fiery surge that from the precipice
Of Heaven received us falling and the thunder
Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage
Perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep
Let us not slip th occasion whether scorn
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe
Seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild
The seat of desolation void of light
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend
From off the tossing of these fiery waves
There rest if any rest can harbour there
And reassembling our afflicted powers
Consult how we may henceforth most offend
Our enemy our own loss how repair
How overcome this dire calamity
What reinforcement we may gain from hope
If not what resolution from despair"
  Thus Satan talking to his nearest mate
With head uplift above the wave and eyes
That sparkling blazed his other parts besides
Prone on the flood extended long and large
Lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge
As whom the fables name of monstrous size
Titanian or Earthborn that warred on Jove
Briareos or Typhon whom the den
By ancient Tarsus held or that seabeast
Leviathan which God of all his works
Created hugest that swim MZ KKQTUGVVENE
