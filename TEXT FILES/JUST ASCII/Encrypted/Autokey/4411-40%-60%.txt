Youd better not do that again which produced another dead
silence

  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright
idea came into her head  If I eat one of these cakes she
thought its sure to make SOME change in my size and as it
cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I
suppose

  So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find
that she began shrinking directly  As soon as she was small
enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and
found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
The poor little Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by
two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she
ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a
thick wood

  The first thing Ive got to do said Alice to herself as she
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
I think that will be the best plan

  It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and
simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the
smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering
about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over
her head made her look up in a great hurry

  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her
Poor little thing said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried
hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the
time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it
would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing

  Hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of
stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped
into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight
and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then Alice
dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run
over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy
made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very
like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle
again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long
way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat
down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its
mouth and its great eyes half shut

  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape
so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out
of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the
distance

  And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she
leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself
with one of the leaves  I should have liked teaching it tricks
very much ifif Id only been the right size to do it  Oh
dear  Id nearly forgotten that Ive got to grow up again  Let
me seehow IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or
drink something or other but the great question is what?

  The great question certainly was what?  Alice looked all round
her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
the circumstances  There was a large mushroom growing near her
about the same height as herself and when she had looked under
it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it

  She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of
the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large
caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded
quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of anything else



                            CHAPTER V

                    Advice from a Caterpillar


  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice

  Who are YOU? said the Caterpillar

  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  Alice
replied rather shyly II hardly know sir just at present
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning but I think
I must have been changed several times since then

  What do you mean by that? said the Caterpillar sternly
Explain yourself

  I cant explain MYSELF Im afraid sir said Alice because
Im not myself you see

  I dont see said the Caterpillar

  Im afraid I cant put it more clearly Alice replied very
politely for I cant understand it myself to begin with and
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing

  It isnt said the Caterpillar

  Well perhaps you havent found it so yet said Alice but
when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you
knowand then after that into a butterfly I should think youll
feel it a little queer wont you?

  Not a bit said the Caterpillar

  Well perhaps your feelings may be different said Alice
all I know is it would feel very queer to ME

  You said the Caterpillar contemptuously  Who are YOU?

  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars
making such VERY short remarks and she drew herself up and said
very gravely I think you ought to tell me who YOU are first

  Why? said the Caterpillar

  Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not
think of any good reason and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
a VERY unpleasant state of mind she turned away

  Come back the Caterpillar called after her  Ive something
important to say

  This sounded promising certainly  Alice turned and came back
again

  Keep your temper said the Caterpillar

  Is that all? said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as
she could

  No said the Caterpillar

  Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else
to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
hearing  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking but
at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth
again and said So you think youre changed do you?

  Im afraid I am sir said Alice I cant remember things as
I usedand I dont keep the same size for ten minutes together

  Cant remember WHAT things? said the Caterpillar

  Well Ive tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE" but it
all came different Alice replied in a very melancholy voice

  Repeat "YOU ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM" said the Caterpillar

  Alice folded her hands and began

    You are old Father William the young man said
      And your hair has become very white
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head
      Do you think at your age it is right?

    In my youth Father William replied to his son
      I feared it might injure the brain
    But now that Im perfectly sure I have none
      Why I do it again and again

    You are old said the youth as I mentioned before
      And have grown most uncommonly fat
    Yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door
      Pray what is the reason of that?

    In my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks
      I kept all my limbs very supple
    By the use of this ointmentone shilling the box
      Allow me to sell you a couple?

    You are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak
      For anything tougher than suet
    Yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak
      Pray how did you manage to do it?

    In my youth said his father I took to the law
      And argued each case with my wife
    And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw
      Has lasted the rest of my life

    You are old said the youth one would hardly suppose
      That your eye was as steady as ever
    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
      What made you so awfully clever?

    I have answered three questions and that is enough
      Said his father dont give yourself airs
    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
      Be off or Ill kick you down stairs


  That is not said right said the Caterpillar

  Not QUITE right Im afraid said Alice timidly some of the
words have got altered

  It is wrong from beginning to end said the Caterpillar
decidedly and there was silence for some minutes

  The Caterpillar was the first to speak

  What size do you want to be? it asked

  Oh Im not particular as to size Alice hastily replied
only one doesnt like changing so often you know

  I DONT know said the Caterpillar

  Alice said nothing  she had never been so much contradicted in
her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper

  Are you content now? said the Caterpillar

  Well I should like to be a LITTLE larger sir if you
wouldnt mind said Alice  three inches is such a wretched
height to be

  It is a very good height indeed said the Caterpillar
angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three
inches high

  But Im not used to it pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone
And she thought of herself I wish the creatures wouldnt be so
easily offended

  Youll get used to it in time said the Caterpillar and it
put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again

  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself  Then it got
down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely
remarking as it went One side will make you grow taller and
the other side will make you grow shorter

  One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT? thought Alice to
herself

  Of the mushroom said the Caterpillar just as if she had
asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight

  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a
minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as
it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question
However at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they
would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand

  And now which is which? she said to herself and nibbled a
little of the righthand bit to try the effect  the next moment
she felt a violent blow underneath her chin  it had struck her
foot

  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but
she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking
rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was
hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and
managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit


                                               

                                            

                                               

  Come my heads free at last said Alice in a tone of
delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she
found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found  all she could
see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
far below her

  What CAN all that green stuff be? said Alice  And where
HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh my poor hands how is it I
cant see you?  She was moving them about as she spoke but no
result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the
distant green leaves

  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her
head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted
to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction
like a serpent  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a
graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which
she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she
had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
hurry  a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating
her violently with its wings

  Serpent screamed the Pigeon

  Im NOT a serpent said Alice indignantly  Let me alone

  Serpent I say again repeated the Pigeon but in a more
subdued tone and added with a kind of sob Ive tried every
way and nothing seems to suit them

  I havent the least idea what youre talking about said
Alice

  Ive tried the roots of trees and Ive tried banks and Ive
tried hedges the Pigeon went on without attending to her but
those serpents  Theres no pleasing them

  Alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no
use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished

  As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the
Pigeon but I must be on the lookout for serpents night and
day  Why I havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks

  Im very sorry youve been annoyed said Alice who was
beginning to see its meaning

  And just as Id taken the highest tree in the wood continued
the Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as I was
thinking I should be free of them at last they must needs come
wriggling down from the sky  Ugh Serpent

  But Im NOT a serpent I tell you said Alice  Im aIm
a

  Well  WHAT are you? said the Pigeon  I can see youre
trying to invent something

  IIm a little girl said Alice rather doubtfully as she
remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day

  A likely story indeed said the Pigeon in a tone of the
deepest contempt  Ive seen a good many little girls in my
time but never ONE with such a neck as that  No no  Youre a
serpent and theres no use denying it  I suppose youll be
telling me next that you never tasted an egg

  I HAVE tasted eggs certainly said Alice who was a very
truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as
serpents do you know

  I dont believe it said the Pigeon but if they do why
then theyre a kind of serpent thats all I can say

  This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent
for a minute or two which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of
adding Youre looking for eggs I know THAT well enough and
what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a
serpent?

  It matters a good deal to ME said Alice hastily but Im
not looking for eggs as it happens and if I was I shouldnt
want YOURS  I dont like them raw

  Well be off then said the Pigeon in a sulky tone as it
settled down again into its nest  Alice crouched down among the
trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled
among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and
untwist it  After a while she remembered that she still held the
pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very
carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and
growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height

  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size
that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a
few minutes and began talking to herself as usual  Come
theres half my plan done now  How puzzling all these changes
are  Im never sure what Im going to be from one minute to
another  However Ive got back to my right size  the next
thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow IS that to be
done I wonder?  As she said this she came suddenly upon an
open place with a little house in it about four feet high
Whoever lives there thought Alice itll never do to come
upon them THIS size  why I should frighten them out of their
wits  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did
not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself
down to nine inches high
