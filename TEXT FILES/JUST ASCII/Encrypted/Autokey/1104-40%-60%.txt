  Chorus again cried the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle had

was heard in the distance

  Come on cried the Gryphon and taking Alice by the hand
it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song

  What trial is it? Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon
only answered Come on and ran the faster while more and more
faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the

                           CHAPTER XI

                      Who Stole the Tarts?


  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts
of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards
the Knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on
each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the
other  In the very middle of the court was a table with a large
dish of tarts upon it  they looked so good that it made Alice
quite hungry to look at themI wish theyd get the trial done
she thought and hand round the refreshments  But there seemed
to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about
her to pass away the time

  Alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had
read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that
she knew the name of nearly everything there  Thats the
judge she said to herself because of his great wig

  The judge by the way was the King and as he wore his crown
over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he
did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly
not becoming

  And thats the jurybox thought Alice and those twelve
creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because
some of them were animals and some were birds I suppose they
are the jurors  She said this last word two or three times over
to herself being rather proud of it  for she thought and
rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the
meaning of it at all  However jurymen would have done just
as well

  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
What are they doing?  Alice whispered to the Gryphon  They
cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun

  Theyre putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in
reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the
trial

  Stupid things Alice began in a loud indignant voice but
she stopped hastily for the White Rabbit cried out Silence in
the court and the King put on his spectacles and looked
anxiously round to make out who was talking

  Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their
shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things
on their slates and she could even make out that one of them
didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his
neighbour to tell him  A nice muddle their slatesll be in
before the trials over thought Alice

  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked  This of course
Alice could not stand and she went round the court and got
behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it
away  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was
Bill the Lizard could not make out at all what had become of
it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write
with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very
little use as it left no mark on the slate

  Herald read the accusation said the King

  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and
then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows

    The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts
          All on a summer day
      The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts
          And took them quite away

  Consider your verdict the King said to the jury

  Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted  Theres
a great deal to come before that

  Call the first witness said the King and the White Rabbit
blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out First
witness

  The first witness was the Hatter  He came in with a teacup in
one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other  I beg
pardon your Majesty he began for bringing these in  but I
hadnt quite finished my tea when I was sent for

  You ought to have finished said the King  When did you
begin?

  The Hatter looked at the March Hare who had followed him into
the court arminarm with the Dormouse  Fourteenth of March I
think it was he said

  Fifteenth said the March Hare

  Sixteenth added the Dormouse

  Write that down the King said to the jury and the jury
eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then
added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence

  Take off your hat the King said to the Hatter

  It isnt mine said the Hatter

  Stolen the King exclaimed turning to the jury who
instantly made a memorandum of the fact

  I keep them to sell the Hatter added as an explanation
Ive none of my own  Im a hatter

  Here the Queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the
Hatter who turned pale and fidgeted

  Give your evidence said the King and dont be nervous or
Ill have you executed on the spot

  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all  he kept
shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the
Queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his
teacup instead of the breadandbutter

  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which
puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was  she was
beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she
would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she
decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for
her

  I wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the Dormouse who was
sitting next to her  I can hardly breathe

  I cant help it said Alice very meekly  Im growing

  Youve no right to grow here said the Dormouse

  Dont talk nonsense said Alice more boldly  you know
youre growing too

  Yes but I grow at a reasonable pace said the Dormouse
not in that ridiculous fashion  And he got up very sulkily
and crossed over to the other side of the court

  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the
Hatter and just as the Dormouse crossed the court she said to
one of the officers of the court Bring me the list of the
singers in the last concert on which the wretched Hatter
trembled so that he shook both his shoes off

  Give your evidence the King repeated angrily or Ill have
you executed whether youre nervous or not

  Im a poor man your Majesty the Hatter began in a
trembling voice and I hadnt begun my teanot above a week
or soand what with the breadandbutter getting so thinand
the twinkling of the tea

  The twinkling of the what? said the King

  It began with the tea the Hatter replied

  Of course twinkling begins with a T said the King sharply
Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on

  Im a poor man the Hatter went on and most things
twinkled after thatonly the March Hare said

  I didnt the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry

  You did said the Hatter

  I deny it said the March Hare

  He denies it said the King  leave out that part

  Well at any rate the Dormouse said the Hatter went on
looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too  but the
Dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep

  After that continued the Hatter I cut some more bread
andbutter

  But what did the Dormouse say? one of the jury asked

  That I cant remember said the Hatter

  You MUST remember remarked the King or Ill have you
executed

  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter
and went down on one knee  Im a poor man your Majesty he
began

  Youre a very poor speaker said the King

  Here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately
suppressed by the officers of the court  As that is rather a
hard word I will just explain to you how it was done  They had
a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings
into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat
upon it

  Im glad Ive seen that done thought Alice  Ive so often
read in the newspapers at the end of trials "There was some
attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the
officers of the court" and I never understood what it meant
till now

  If thats all you know about it you may stand down
continued the King

  I cant go no lower said the Hatter  Im on the floor as
it is

  Then you may SIT down the King replied

  Here the other guineapig cheered and was suppressed

  Come that finished the guineapigs thought Alice  Now we
shall get on better

  Id rather finish my tea said the Hatter with an anxious
look at the Queen who was reading the list of singers

  You may go said the King and the Hatter hurriedly left the
court without even waiting to put his shoes on

  and just take his head off outside the Queen added to one
of the officers  but the Hatter was out of sight before the
officer could get to the door

  Call the next witness said the King

  The next witness was the Duchesss cook  She carried the
pepperbox in her hand and Alice guessed who it was even before
she got into the court by the way the people near the door began
sneezing all at once

  Give your evidence said the King

  Shant said the cook

  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit who said in a
low voice Your Majesty must crossexamine THIS witness

  Well if I must I must the King said with a melancholy
air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till
his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice What
are tarts made of?

  Pepper mostly said the cook

  Treacle said a sleepy voice behind her

  Collar that Dormouse the Queen shrieked out  Behead that
Dormouse  Turn that Dormouse out of court  Suppress him  Pinch
him  Off with his whiskers

  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the
Dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down
again the cook had disappeared

  Never mind said the King with an air of great relief
Call the next witness  And he added in an undertone to the
Queen Really my dear YOU must crossexamine the next witness
It quite makes my forehead ache

  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like
for they havent got much evidence YET she said to herself
Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out at the top
of his shrill little voice the name Alice



                           CHAPTER XII

                        Alices Evidence


  Here cried Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with
the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
the week before

  Oh I BEG your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
and put back into the jurybox or they would die

  The trial cannot proceed said the King in a very grave
voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places
ALL he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at Alice as
he said do

  Alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she
had put the Lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable
to move  She soon got it out again and put it right not that
it signifies much she said to herself I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other

  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write
out a history of the accident all except the Lizard who seemed
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open
gazing up into the roof of the court

  What do you know about this business? the King said to
Alice

  Nothing said Alice

  Nothing WHATEVER? persisted the King

  Nothing whatever said Alice

  Thats very important the King said turning to the jury
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates when
the White Rabbit interrupted  UNimportant your Majesty means
of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and
making faces at him as he spoke

  UNimportant of course I meant the King hastily said and
went on to himself in an undertone importantunimportant
unimportantimportant as if he were trying which word
sounded best

  Some of the jury wrote it down important and some
unimportant  Alice could see this as she was near enough to
look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she
thought to herself

  At this moment the King who had been for some time busily
writing in his notebook cackled out Silence and read out
from his book Rule Fortytwo  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT

  Everybody looked at Alice

  IM not a mile high said Alice

  You are said the King

  Nearly two miles high added the Queen

  Well I shant go at any rate said Alice  besides
thats not a regular rule  you invented it just now

  Its the oldest rule in the book said the King

  Then it ought to be Number One said Alice

  The King turned pale and shut his notebook hastily
Consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling
voice

  Theres more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said
the White Rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has
just been picked up

  Whats in it? said the Queen

  I havent opened it yet said the White Rabbit but it seems
to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody

  It must have been that said the King unless it was
written to nobody which isnt usual you know

  Who is it directed to? said one of the jurymen

  It isnt directed at all said the White Rabbit in fact
theres nothing written on the OUTSIDE  He unfolded the paper
as he spoke and added It isnt a letter after all  its a set
of verses

  Are they in the prisoners handwriting? asked another of
they jurymen

  No theyre not said the White Rabbit and thats the
queerest thing about it  The jury all looked puzzled

  He must have imitated somebody elses hand said the King
The jury all brightened up again

  Please your Majesty said the Knave I didnt write it and
they cant prove I did  theres no name signed at the end

  If you didnt sign it said the King that only makes the
matter worse  You MUST have meant some mischief or else youd
have signed your name like an honest man

  There was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the
first really clever thing the King had said that day

  That PROVES his guilt said the Queen

  It proves nothing of the sort said Alice  Why you dont
even know what theyre about

  Read them said the King

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles  Where shall I begin
please your Majesty? he asked

  Begin at the beginning the King said gravely and go on
till you come to the end  then stop

  These were the verses the White Rabbit read

        They told me you had been to her
          And mentioned me to him
        She gave me a good character
          But said I could not swim

        He sent them word I had not gone
          We know it to be true
        If she should push the matter on
          What would become of you?

        I gave her one they gave him two
          You gave us three or more
        They all returned from him to you
          Though they were mine before

        If I or she should chance to be
          Involved in this affair
        He trusts to you to set them free
          Exactly as we were

        My notion was that you had been
          Before she had this fit
        An obstacle that came between
          Him and ourselves and it

        Dont let him know she liked them best
          For this must ever be
        A secret kept from all the rest
          Between yourself and me

  Thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet
said the King rubbing his hands so now let the jury

  If any one of them can explain it said Alice she had
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit
afraid of interrupting him Ill give him sixpence  I dont
believe theres an atom of meaning in it

  The jury all wrote down on their slates SHE doesnt believe
theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to
explain the paper

  If theres no meaning in it said the King that saves a
world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any  And
yet I dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his
knee and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some
meaning in them after all  "SAID I COULD NOT SWIM" you
cant swim can you? he added turning to the Knave

  The Knave shook his head sadly  Do I look like it? he said
Which he certainly did NOT being made entirely of cardboard

  All right so far said the King and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself  "WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE" thats
the jury of course "I GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO" why
that must be what he did with the tarts you know

  But it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU" said
Alice

  Why there they are said the King triumphantly pointing to
the tarts on the table  Nothing can be clearer than THAT
Then again"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT"  you never had fits my
dear I think? he said to the Queen

  Never said the Queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke  The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no
mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was
trickling down his face as long as it lasted

  Then the words dont FIT you said the King looking round
the court with a smile  There was a dead silence

  Its a pun the King added in an offended tone and
everybody laughed Let the jury consider their verdict the
King said for about the twentieth time that day

  No no said the Queen  Sentence firstverdict afterwards

  Stuff and nonsense said Alice loudly  The idea of having
the sentence first

  Hold your tongue said the Queen turning purple

  I wont said Alice

  Off with her head the Queen shouted at the top of her voice
Nobody moved

  Who cares for you? said Alice she had grown to her full
size by this time  Youre nothing but a pack of cards

  At this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying
down upon her  she gave a little scream half of fright and half
of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on
the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face

  Wake up Alice dear said her sister Why what a long
sleep youve had

  Oh Ive had such a curious dream said Alice and she told
her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and
when she had finished her sister kissed her and said It WAS a
curious dream dear certainly  but now run in to your tea its
getting late  So Alice got up and ran off thinking while she
ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been

  But her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her
head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures till she too began
dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream

  First she dreamed of little Alice herself and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her
voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyesand
still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
sisters dream

  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
bythe frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their neverending meal
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the
Duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce
more the shriek of the Gryphon the squeaking of the Lizards
slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs
filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle

  So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in
Wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and
all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only
rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep
bells and the Queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the Gryphon and
all thy other queer noises would change she knew to the
confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtles
heavy sobs

  Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how
she would keep through all her riper years the simple and
loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about
her other little children and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their
simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys
remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days
