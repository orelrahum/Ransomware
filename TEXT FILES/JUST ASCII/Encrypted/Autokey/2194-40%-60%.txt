TOUCHSTONE	And mine but it grows something stale with me

CELIA	I pray you one of you question yond man
	If he for gold will give us any food
	I faint almost to death

TOUCHSTONE	Holla you clown

ROSALIND	Peace fool hes not thy kinsman

CORIN	Who calls?

TOUCHSTONE	Your betters sir

CORIN	                  Else are they very wretched

ROSALIND	Peace I say Good even to you friend

CORIN	And to you gentle sir and to you all

ROSALIND	I prithee shepherd if that love or gold
	Can in this desert place buy entertainment
	Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
	Heres a young maid with travel much oppressd
	And faints for succor

CORIN	Fair sir I pity her
	And wish for her sake more than for mine own
	My fortunes were more able to relieve her
	But I am shepherd to another man
	And do not shear the fleeces that I graze
	My master is of churlish disposition
	And little recks to find the way to heaven
	By doing deeds of hospitality
	Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
	Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
	By reason of his absence there is nothing
	That you will feed on but what is come see
	And in my voice most welcome shall you be

ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

CORIN	That young swain that you saw here but erewhile
	That little cares for buying any thing

ROSALIND	I pray thee if it stand with honesty
	Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
	And thou shalt have to pay for it of us

CELIA	And we will mend thy wages I like this place
	And willingly could waste my time in it

CORIN	Assuredly the thing is to be sold
	Go with me if you like upon report
	The soil the profit and this kind of life
	I will your very faithful feeder be
	And buy it with your gold right suddenly

	Exeunt

SCENE V	The Forest


	Enter AMIENS JAQUES and others

	SONG
AMIENS	Under the greenwood tree
	Who loves to lie with me
	And turn his merry note
	Unto the sweet birds throat
	Come hither come hither come hither
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather

JAQUES	More more I prithee more

AMIENS	It will make you melancholy Monsieur Jaques

JAQUES	I thank it More I prithee more I can suck
	melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs
	More I prithee more

AMIENS	My voice is ragged I know I cannot please you

JAQUES	I do not desire you to please me I do desire you to
	sing Come more another stanzo call you em stanzos?

AMIENS	What you will Monsieur Jaques

JAQUES	Nay I care not for their names they owe me
	nothing Will you sing?

AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself

JAQUES	Well then if ever I thank any man Ill thank you
	but that they call compliment is like the encounter
	of two dogapes and when a man thanks me heartily
	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
	the beggarly thanks Come sing and you that will
	not hold your tongues

AMIENS	Well Ill end the song Sirs cover the while the
	duke will drink under this tree He hath been all
	this day to look you

JAQUES	And I have been all this day to avoid him He is
	too disputable for my company I think of as many
	matters as he but I give heaven thanks and make no
	boast of them Come warble come

	SONG
	Who doth ambition shun

	All together here

	And loves to live i the sun
	Seeking the food he eats
	And pleased with what he gets
	Come hither come hither come hither
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather

JAQUES	Ill give you a verse to this note that I made
	yesterday in despite of my invention

AMIENS	And Ill sing it

JAQUES	Thus it goes

	If it do come to pass
	That any man turn ass
	Leaving his wealth and ease
	A stubborn will to please
	Ducdame ducdame ducdame
	Here shall he see
	Gross fools as he
	An if he will come to me

AMIENS	Whats that ducdame?

JAQUES	Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a
	circle Ill go sleep if I can if I cannot Ill
	rail against all the firstborn of Egypt

AMIENS	And Ill go seek the duke his banquet is prepared

	Exeunt severally

ACT II



SCENE VII	The forest


	A table set out Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and
	Lords like outlaws

DUKE SENIOR	I think he be transformd into a beast
	For I can no where find him like a man

First Lord	My lord he is but even now gone hence
	Here was he merry hearing of a song

DUKE SENIOR	If he compact of jars grow musical
	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres
	Go seek him tell him I would speak with him

	Enter JAQUES

First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach

DUKE SENIOR	Why how now monsieur what a life is this
	That your poor friends must woo your company?
	What you look merrily

JAQUES	A fool a fool I met a fool i the forest
	A motley fool a miserable world
	As I do live by food I met a fool
	Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun
	And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms
	In good set terms and yet a motley fool
	Good morrow fool quoth I No sir quoth he
	Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
	And then he drew a dial from his poke
	And looking on it with lacklustre eye
	Says very wisely It is ten oclock
	Thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
	Tis but an hour ago since it was nine
	And after one hour more twill be eleven
	And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
	And then from hour to hour we rot and rot
	And thereby hangs a tale When I did hear
	The motley fool thus moral on the time
	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
	That fools should be so deepcontemplative
	And I did laugh sans intermission
	An hour by his dial O noble fool
	A worthy fool Motleys the only wear

DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?

JAQUES	O worthy fool One that hath been a courtier
	And says if ladies be but young and fair
	They have the gift to know it and in his brain
	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
	After a voyage he hath strange places crammd
	With observation the which he vents
	In mangled forms O that I were a fool
	I am ambitious for a motley coat

DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one

JAQUES	It is my only suit
	Provided that you weed your better judgments
	Of all opinion that grows rank in them
	That I am wise I must have liberty
	Withal as large a charter as the wind
	To blow on whom I please for so fools have
	And they that are most galled with my folly
	They most must laugh And why sir must they so?
	The why is plain as way to parish church
	He that a fool doth very wisely hit
	Doth very foolishly although he smart
	Not to seem senseless of the bob if not
	The wise mans folly is anatomized
	Even by the squandering glances of the fool
	Invest me in my motley give me leave
	To speak my mind and I will through and through
	Cleanse the foul body of the infected world
	If they will patiently receive my medicine

DUKE SENIOR	Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do

JAQUES	What for a counter would I do but good?

DUKE SENIOR	Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
	For thou thyself hast been a libertine
	As sensual as the BJNAMTY MMQFN AMARRN
