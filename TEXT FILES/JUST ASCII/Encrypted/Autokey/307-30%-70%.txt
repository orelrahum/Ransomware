Algeria Economy

Overview
    The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy Algeria
    depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its export receipts about  of
    government revenues and nearly  of GDP In  the sharp increase in
    oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
    program of industrialization Plunging oil and gas prices combined with the
    mismanagement of Algerias highly centralized economy has brought the
    nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence in
     The government has promised farreaching reforms including
    privatization of some public sector companies encouraging privatesector
    activity boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports and proposing a major
    overhaul of the banking and financial systems but to date it has made only
    limited progress
