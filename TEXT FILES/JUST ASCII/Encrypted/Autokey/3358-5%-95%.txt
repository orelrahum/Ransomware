where the title or author is or what the sections of that document would be
OCLC wants to make that structure explicit in the database because it will
be important for retrieval purposes

The second big advantage of SGML is that it gives one the ability to
build structure into the database that can be used for display purposes
without contaminating the data with instructions about how to format
things  The distinction lies between procedural markup which tells one
where to put dots on the page and descriptive markup which describes
the elements of a document

WEIBEL believes that there should be no procedural markup in the data at
all that the data should be completely unsullied by information about
italics or boldness  That should be left up to the display device
whether that display device is a page printer or a screen display device
By keeping ones database free of that kind of contamination one can
make decisions down the road for example reorganize the data in ways
that are not cramped by builtin notions of what should be italic and
what should be bold  WEIBEL strongly advocated descriptive markup  As
an example he illustrated the index structure in the CORE data  With
subsequent illustrated examples of markup WEIBEL acknowledged the common
complaint that SGML is hard to read in its native form although markup
decreases considerably once one gets into the body  Without the markup
however one would not have the structure in the data  One can pass
markup through a LaTeX processor and convert it relatively easily to a
printed version of the document

WEIBEL next illustrated an extremely cluttered screen dump of OCLCs
system in order to show as much as possible the inherent capability on
the screen  He noted parenthetically that he had become a supporter of
XWindows as a result of the progress of the CORE Project  WEIBEL also
illustrated the two major parts of the interface  l a control box that
allows one to generate lists of items which resembles a small table of
contents based on key words one wishes to search and  a document
viewer which is a separate process in and of itself  He demonstrated
how to follow links through the electronic database simply by selecting
the appropriate button and bringing them up  He also noted problems that
remain to be accommodated in the interface eg as pointed out by LESK
what happens when users do not click on the icon for the figure

Given the constraints of time WEIBEL omitted a large number of ancillary
items in order to say a few words concerning storage requirements and
what will be required to put a lot of things on line  Since it is
extremely expensive to reconvert all of this data especially if it is
just in paper form and even if it is in electronic form in typesetting
tapes he advocated building journals electronically from the start  In
that case if one only has text graphics and indexing which is all that
one needs with de novo electronic publishing because there is no need to
go back and look at bitmaps of pages one can get  journals of
full text or almost  million pages per year  These pages can be put in
approximately  gigabytes of storage which is not all that much
WEIBEL said  For twenty years something less than three terabytes would
be required  WEIBEL calculated the costs of storing this information as
follows  If a gigabyte costs approximately  then a terabyte costs
approximately  million to buy in terms of hardware  One also needs a
building to put it in and a staff like OCLC to handle that information
So to support a terabyte multiply by five which gives  million per
year for a supported terabyte of data

                                 


DISCUSSION  Tapes saved by ACS are the typography files originally
supporting publication of the journal  Cost of building tagged text into
the database 


During the questionandanswer period that followed WEIBELs
presentation these clarifications emerged  The tapes saved by the
American Chemical Society are the typography files that originally
supported the publication of the journal  Although they are not tagged
in SGML they are tagged in very fine detail  Every single sentence is
marked all the registry numbers all the publications issues dates and
volumes  No cost figures on tagging material on a permegabyte basis
were available  Because ACSs typesetting system runs from tagged text
there is no extra cost per article  It was unknown what it costs ACS to
keyboard the tagged text rather than just keyboard the text in the
cheapest process  In other words since one intends to publish things
and will need to build tagged text into a typography system in any case
if one does that in such a way that it can drive not only typography but
an electronic system which is what ACS intends to domove to SGML
publishing the marginal cost is zero  The marginal cost represents the
cost of building tagged text into the database which is small
