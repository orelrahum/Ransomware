Poland Economy

Overview
    Poland is undergoing a difficult transition from a Sovietstyle economy 
    with state ownership and control of productive assets  to a market economy
    On January   the new Solidarityled government implemented shock
    therapy by slashing subsidies decontrolling prices tightening the money
    supply stabilizing the foreign exchange rate lowering import barriers and
    restraining state sector wages As a result consumer goods shortages and
    lines disappeared and inflation fell from  in  to  in 
    Western governments which hold twothirds of Polands  billion external
    debt pledged in  to forgive half of Polands official debt by  and
    the private sector grew accounting for  of industrial production and 
    of nonagricultural output by  Production fell in state enterprises
    however and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing
    in  to  in December  Poland fell out of compliance with its
    IMF program by mid and talks with commercial creditors stalled The
    increase in unemployment and the decline in living standards led to popular
    discontent and a change in government in January  and again in December
    The new government has promised selective industrial intervention some
    relaxation in monetary policy and an improved social safety net but will
    be constrained by the decline in output and the growing budget deficit
