     of GDP in  to over  in  No other sector has experienced such
    growth especially not agriculture which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
    poor soils The unemployment rate remains a problem at  Although diamond
    production remained level in FY substantial gains in coal output and
    manufacturing helped boost the economy

Brazil Economy

Overview
    The economy with large agrarian mining and manufacturing sectors entered
    the s with declining real growth runaway inflation an unserviceable
    foreign debt of  billion and a lack of policy direction In addition
    the economy remained highly regulated inwardlooking and protected by
    substantial trade and investment barriers Ownership of major industrial and
    mining facilities is divided among private interests  including several
    multinationals  and the government Most large agricultural holdings are
    private with the government channeling financing to this sector Conflicts
    between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
    violence The Collor government which assumed office in March  is
    embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to modernize and
    reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices deregulating the economy
    and opening it to increased foreign competition The government in December
     signed a letter of intent with the IMF for a month standby loan
    Having reached an agreement on the repayment of interest arrears accumulated
    during  and  Brazilian officials and commercial bankers are engaged
    in talks on the reduction of medium and longterm debt and debt service
    payments and on the elimination of remaining interest arrears A major
