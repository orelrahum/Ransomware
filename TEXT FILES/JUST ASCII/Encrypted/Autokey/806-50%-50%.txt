of which was a bright brass plate with the name W RABBIT
engraved upon it  She went in without knocking and hurried
upstairs in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann
and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and
gloves

  How queer it seems Alice said to herself to be going
messages for a rabbit  I suppose Dinahll be sending me on
messages next  And she began fancying the sort of thing that
would happen  "Miss Alice  Come here directly and get ready
for your walk" "Coming in a minute nurse  But Ive got to see
that the mouse doesnt get out"  Only I dont think Alice went
on that theyd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
people about like that

  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with
a table in the window and on it as she had hoped a fan and two
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves  she took up the fan and
a pair of the gloves and was just going to leave the room when
her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking
glass  There was no label this time with the words DRINK ME
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips  I know
SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen she said to herself
whenever I eat or drink anything so Ill just see what this
bottle does  I do hope itll make me grow large again for
really Im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing

  It did so indeed and much sooner than she had expected
before she had drunk half the bottle she found her head pressing
against the ceiling and had to stoop to save her neck from being
broken  She hastily put down the bottle saying to herself
Thats quite enoughI hope I shant grow any moreAs it is I
cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt drunk quite so
much

  Alas it was too late to wish that  She went on growing and
growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor  in
another minute there was not even room for this and she tried
the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the
other arm curled round her head  Still she went on growing and
as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one
foot up the chimney and said to herself Now I can do no more
whatever happens  What WILL become of me?

  Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full
effect and she grew no larger  still it was very uncomfortable
and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting
out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy

  It was much pleasanter at home thought poor Alice when one
wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about
by mice and rabbits  I almost wish I hadnt gone down that
rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know
this sort of life  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me
When I used to read fairytales I fancied that kind of thing
never happened and now here I am in the middle of one  There
ought to be a book written about me that there ought  And when
I grow up Ill write onebut Im grown up now she added in a
sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more
HERE

  But then thought Alice shall I NEVER get any older than I
am now?  Thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old woman
but thenalways to have lessons to learn  Oh I shouldnt like
THAT

  Oh you foolish Alice she answered herself  How can you
learn lessons in here?  Why theres hardly room for YOU and no
room at all for any lessonbooks

  And so she went on taking first one side and then the other
and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few
minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen

  Mary Ann  Mary Ann said the voice  Fetch me my gloves
this moment  Then came a little pattering of feet on the
stairs  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and
she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she
was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no
reason to be afraid of it

  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it
but as the door opened inwards and Alices elbow was pressed
hard against it that attempt proved a failure  Alice heard it
say to itself Then Ill go round and get in at the window

  THAT you wont thought Alice and after waiting till she
fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window she suddenly
spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air  She did not
get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall
and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was
just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something
of the sort

  Next came an angry voicethe RabbitsPat Pat  Where are
you?  And then a voice she had never heard before Sure then
Im here  Digging for apples yer honour

  Digging for apples indeed said the Rabbit angrily  Here
Come and help me out of THIS  Sounds of more broken glass

  Now tell me Pat whats that in the window?

  Sure its an arm yer honour  He pronounced it arrum

  An arm you goose   Who ever saw one that size?  Why it
fills the whole window

  Sure it does yer honour  but its an arm for all that

  Well its got no business there at any rate  go and take it
away

  There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then such as Sure I dont like it yer
honour at all at all  Do as I tell you you coward and at
last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in
the air  This time there were TWO little shrieks and more
sounds of broken glass  What a number of cucumberframes there
must be thought Alice  I wonder what theyll do next  As for
pulling me out of the window I only wish they COULD  Im sure I
dont want to stay in here any longer

  She waited for some time without hearing anything more  at
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a
good many voice all talking together  she made out the words
Wheres the other ladder?Why I hadnt to bring but one
Bills got the otherBill fetch it here ladHere put em up
at this cornerNo tie em together firstthey dont reach half
high enough yetOh theyll do well enough dont be particular
Here Bill catch hold of this ropeWill the roof bear?Mind
that loose slateOh its coming down  Heads below a loud
crashNow who did that?It was Bill I fancyWhos to go
down the chimney?Nay I shant YOU do itThat I wont
thenBills to go downHere Bill the master says youre to
go down the chimney

  Oh So Bills got to come down the chimney has he? said
Alice to herself  Shy they seem to put everything upon Bill
I wouldnt be in Bills place for a good deal  this fireplace is
narrow to be sure but I THINK I can kick a little

  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and
waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what
sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above her  then saying to herself This is Bill she gave one
sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next

  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes
Bill then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him you by the
hedge then silence and then another confusion of voicesHold
up his headBrandy nowDont choke himHow was it old fellow?
What happened to you?  Tell us all about it

  Last came a little feeble squeaking voice Thats Bill
thought Alice Well I hardly knowNo more thank ye Im
better nowbut Im a deal too flustered to tell youall I know
is something comes at me like a Jackinthebox and up I goes
like a skyrocket

  So you did old fellow said the others

  We must burn the house down said the Rabbits voice and
Alice called out as loud as she could If you do  Ill set
Dinah at you

  There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to
herself I wonder what they WILL do next  If they had any
sense theyd take the roof off  After a minute or two they
began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say A
barrowful will do to begin with

  A barrowful of WHAT? thought Alice but she had not long to
doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face
Ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out
Youd better not do that again which produced another dead
silence

  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright
idea came into her head  If I eat one of these cakes she
thought its sure to make SOME change in my size and as it
