Flown to the upper world the rest were all
Far to the inland retired about the walls
Of Pandemonium city and proud seat
Of Lucifer so by allusion called
Of that bright star to Satan paragoned
There kept their watch the legions while the Grand
In council sat solicitous what chance
Might intercept their emperour sent so he
Departing gave command and they observed
As when the Tartar from his Russian foe
By Astracan over the snowy plains
Retires or Bactrin Sophi from the horns
Of Turkish crescent leaves all waste beyond
The realm of Aladule in his retreat
To Tauris or Casbeen  So these the late
Heavenbanished host left desart utmost Hell
Many a dark league reduced in careful watch
Round their metropolis and now expecting
Each hour their great adventurer from the search
Of foreign worlds  He through the midst unmarked
In show plebeian Angel militant
Of lowest order passed and from the door
Of that Plutonian hall invisible
Ascended his high throne which under state
Of richest texture spread at the upper end
Was placed in regal lustre  Down a while
He sat and round about him saw unseen
At last as from a cloud his fulgent head
And shape starbright appeared or brighter clad
With what permissive glory since his fall
Was left him or false glitter  All amazed
At that so sudden blaze the Stygian throng
Bent their aspect and whom they wished beheld
Their mighty Chief returned loud was the acclaim
Forth rushed in haste the great consulting peers
Raised from their dark Divan and with like joy
Congratulant approached him who with hand
Silence and with these words attention won
Thrones Dominations Princedoms Virtues Powers
For in possession such not only of right
I call ye and declare ye now returned
Successful beyond hope to lead ye forth
Triumphant out of this infernal pit
Abominable accursed the house of woe
And dungeon of our tyrant  Now possess
As Lords a spacious world to our native Heaven
Little inferiour by my adventure hard
With peril great achieved  Long were to tell
What I have done what sufferedwith what pain
Voyaged th unreal vast unbounded deep
Of horrible confusion over which
By Sin and Death a broad way now is paved
To expedite your glorious march but I
Toiled out my uncouth passage forced to ride
The untractable abyss plunged in the womb
Of unoriginal Night and Chaos wild
That jealous of their secrets fiercely opposed
My journey strange with clamorous uproar
Protesting Fate supreme thence how I found
The new created world which fame in Heaven
Long had foretold a fabrick wonderful
Of absolute perfection therein Man
Placed in a Paradise by our exile
Made happy  Him by fraud I have seduced
From his Creator and the more to encrease
Your wonder with an apple he thereat
Offended worth your laughter hath given up
Both his beloved Man and all his world
To Sin and Death a prey and so to us
Without our hazard labour or alarm
To range in and to dwell and over Man
To rule as over all he should have ruled
True is me also he hath judged or rather
Me not but the brute serpent in whose shape
Man I deceived that which to me belongs
Is enmity which he will put between
Me and mankind I am to bruise his heel
His seed when is not set shall bruise my head
A world who would not purchase with a bruise
Or much more grievous pain?Ye have the account
Of my performance  What remains ye Gods
But up and enter now into full bliss?
So having said a while he stood expecting
Their universal shout and high applause
To fill his ear when contrary he hears
On all sides from innumerable tongues
A dismal universal hiss the sound
Of publick scorn he wondered but not long
Had leisure wondering at himself now more
His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare
His arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining
Each other till supplanted down he fell
A monstrous serpent on his belly prone
Reluctant but in vain a greater power
Now ruled him punished in the shape he sinned
According to his doom he would have spoke
But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
To forked tongue for now were all transformed
Alike to serpents all as accessories
To his bold riot  Dreadful was the din
Of hissing through the hall thick swarming now
With complicated monsters head and tail
Scorpion and Asp and Amphisbaena dire
Cerastes horned Hydrus and Elops drear
And Dipsas not so thick swarmed once the soil
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon or the isle
Ophiusa but still greatest he the midst
Now Dragon grown larger than whom the sun
Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime
Huge Python and his power no less he seemed
Above the rest still to retain they all
Him followed issuing forth to the open field
Where all yet left of that revolted rout
Heavenfallen in station stood or just array
Sublime with expectation when to see
In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief
They saw but other sight instead a croud
Of ugly serpents horrour on them fell
And horrid sympathy for what they saw
They felt themselves now changing down their arms
Down fell both spear and shield down they as fast
And the dire hiss renewed and the dire form
Catched by contagion like in punishment
As in their crime  Thus was the applause they meant
Turned to exploding hiss triumph to shame
Cast on themselves from their own mouths  There stood
A grove hard by sprung up with this their change
His will who reigns above to aggravate
Their penance laden with fair fruit like that
Which grew in Paradise the bait of Eve
Used by the Tempter on that prospect strange
Their earnest eyes they fixed imagining
For one forbidden tree a multitude
Now risen to work them further woe or shame
Yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce
Though to delude them sent could not abstain
But on they rolled in heaps and up the trees
Climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks
That curled Megaera greedily they plucked
The fruitage fair to sight like that which grew
Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed
This more delusive not the touch but taste
Deceived they fondly thinking to allay
Their appetite with gust instead of fruit
Chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste
With spattering noise rejected oft they assayed
Hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft
With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws
With soot and cinders filled so oft they fell
Into the same illusion not as Man
Whom they triumphed once lapsed  Thus were they plagued
And worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss
Till their lost shape permitted they resumed
Yearly enjoined some say to undergo
This annual humbling certain numbered days
To dash their pride and joy for Man seduced
However some tradition they dispersed
Among the Heathen of their purchase got
And fabled how the Serpent whom they called
Ophion with Eurynome the wide
Encroaching Eve perhaps had first the rule
Of high Olympus thence by Saturn driven
And Ops ere yet Dictaean Jove was born
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
Too soon arrived Sin there in power before
Once actual now in body and to dwell
Habitual habitant behind her Death
Close following pace for pace not mounted yet
On his pale horse to whom Sin thus began
Second of Satan sprung allconquering Death
What thinkest thou of our empire now though earned
With travel difficult not better far
Than still at Hells dark threshold to have sat watch
Unnamed undreaded and thyself half starved?
Whom thus the Sinborn monster answered soon
To me who with eternal famine pine
Alike is Hell or Paradise or Heaven
There best where most with ravine I may meet
Which here though plenteous all too little seems
To stuff this maw this vast unhidebound corps
To whom the incestuous mother thus replied
Thou therefore on these herbs and fruits and flowers
Feed first on each beast next and fish and fowl
No homely morsels and whatever thing
The sithe of Time mows down devour unspared
Till I in Man residing through the race
His thoughts his looks words actions all infect
And season him thy last and sweetest prey
This said they both betook them several ways
Both to destroy or unimmortal make
All kinds and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later which the Almighty seeing
From his transcendent seat the Saints among
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice
See with what heat these dogs of Hell advance
To waste and havock yonder world which I
So fair and good created and had still
Kept in that state had not the folly of Man
Let in these wasteful furies who impute
Folly to me so doth the Prince of Hell
And his adherents that with so much ease
I suffer them to enter and possess
A place so heavenly and conniving seem
To gratify my scornful enemies
That laugh as if transported with some fit
Of passion I to them had quitted all
At random yielded up to their misrule
And know not that I called and drew them thither
My Hellhounds to lick up the draff and filth
Which Mans polluting sin with taint hath shed
On what was pure til crammed and gorged nigh burst
With sucked and glutted offal at one sling
Of thy victorious arm wellpleasing Son
Both Sin and Death and yawning Grave at last
Through Chaos hurled obstruct the mouth of Hell
For ever and seal up his ravenous jaws
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure
To sanctity that shall receive no stain
Till then the curse pronounced on both precedes
He ended and the heavenly audience loud
Sung Halleluiah as the sound of seas
Through multitude that sung  Just are thy ways
Righteous are thy decrees on all thy works
Who can extenuate thee?  Next to the Son
Destined Restorer of mankind by whom
New Heaven and Earth shall to the ages rise
Or down from Heaven descendSuch was their song
While the Creator calling forth by name
His mighty Angels gave them several charge
As sorted best with present things  The sun
Had first his precept so to move so shine
As might affect the earth with cold and heat
Scarce tolerable and from the north to call
Decrepit winter from the south to bring
Solstitial summers heat  To the blanc moon
Her office they prescribed to the other five
Their planetary motions and aspects
In sextile square and trine and opposite
Of noxious efficacy and when to join
In synod unbenign and taught the fixed
Their influence malignant when to shower
Which of them rising with the sun or falling
Should prove tempestuous  To the winds they set
Their corners when with bluster to confound
Sea air and shore the thunder when to roll
With terrour through the dark aereal hall
Some say he bid his Angels turn ascanse
The poles of earth twice ten degrees and more
From the suns axle they with labour pushed
Oblique the centrick globe  Some say the sun
Was bid turn reins from the equinoctial road
Like distant breadth to Taurus with the seven
Atlantick Sisters and the Spartan Twins
Up to the Tropick Crab thence down amain
By Leo and the Virgin and the Scales
As deep as Capricorn to bring in change
Of seasons to each clime else had the spring
Perpetual smiled on earth with vernant flowers
Equal in days and nights except to those
Beyond the polar circles to them day
Had unbenighted shone while the low sun
To recompense his distance in their sight
Had rounded still the horizon and not known
Or east or west which had forbid the snow
From cold Estotiland and south as far
Beneath Magellan  At that tasted fruit
The sun as from Thyestean banquet turned
His course intended else how had the world
Inhabited though sinless more than now
Avoided pinching cold and scorching heat?
These changes in the Heavens though slow produced
Like change on sea and land sideral blast
Vapour and mist and exhalation hot
Corrupt and pestilent  Now from the north
Of Norumbega and the Samoed shore
Bursting their brazen dungeon armed with ice
And snow and hail and stormy gust and flaw
Boreas and Caecias and Argestes loud
And Thrascias rend the woods and seas upturn
With adverse blast upturns them from the south
Notus and Afer black with thunderous clouds
From Serraliona thwart of these as fierce
Forth rush the Levant and the Ponent winds
Eurus and Zephyr with their lateral noise
Sirocco and Libecchio  Thus began
Outrage from lifeless things but Discord first
Daughter of Sin among the irrational
Death introduced through fierce antipathy
Beast now with beast gan war and fowl with fowl
And fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving
Devoured each other nor stood much in awe
Of Man but fled him or with countenance grim
Glared on him passing  These were from without
The growing miseries which Adam saw
Already in part though hid in gloomiest shade
To sorrow abandoned but worse felt within
And in a troubled sea of passion tost
Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint
O miserable of happy  Is this the end
Of this new glorious world and me so late
The glory of that glory who now become
Accursed of blessed? hide me from the face
Of God whom to behold was then my highth
Of happinessYet well if here would end
The misery I deserved it and would bear
My own deservings but this will not serve
All that I eat or drink or shall beget
Is propagated curse  O voice once heard
Delightfully Encrease and multiply
Now death to hear for what can I encrease
Or multiply but curses on my head?
Who of all ages to succeed but feeling
The evil on him brought by me will curse
My head?  Ill fare our ancestor impure
For this we may thank Adam but his thanks
Shall be the execration so besides
Mine own that bide upon me all from me
Shall with a fierce reflux on me rebound
On me as on their natural center light
Heavy though in their place  O fleeting joys
Of Paradise dear bought with lasting woes
Did I request thee Maker from my clay
To mould me Man? did I solicit thee
From darkness to promote me or here place
In this delicious garden?  As my will
Concurred not to my being it were but right
And equal to reduce me to my dust
Desirous to resign and render back
All I received unable to perform
Thy terms too hard by which I was to hold
The good I sought not  To the loss of that
Sufficient penalty why hast thou added
The sense of endless woes?  Inexplicable
Why am I mocked with death and lengthened out
To deathless pain?  How gladly would I meet
Mortality my sentence and be earth
Insensible  How glad would lay me down
As in my mothers lap  There I should rest
And sleep secure his dreadful voice no more
Would thunder in my ears no fear of worse
To me and to my offspring would torment me
With cruel expectation  Yet one doubt
Pursues me still lest all I cannot die
Lest that pure breath of life the spirit of Man
Which God inspired cannot together perish
With this corporeal clod then in the grave
Or in some other dismal place who knows
But I shall die a living death?  O thought
Horrid if true  Yet why? It was but breath
Of life that sinned what dies but what had life
And sin?  The body properly had neither
All of me then shall die let this appease
The doubt since human reach no further knows
For though the Lord of all be infinite
Is his wrath also?  Be it Man is not so
But mortal doomed  How can he exercise
Wrath without end on Man whom death must end?
Can he make deathless death?  That were to make
Strange contradiction which to God himself
Impossible is held as argument
Of weakness not of power  Will he draw out
For angers sake finite to infinite
In punished Man to satisfy his rigour
Satisfied never?  That were to extend
His sentence beyond dust and Natures law
By which all causes else according still
To the reception of their matter act
Not to the extent of their own sphere  But say
That death be not one stroke as I supposed
Bereaving sense but endless misery
From this day onward which I feel begun
Both in me and without me and so last
To perpetuityAy methat fear
Comes thundering back with dreadful revolution
On my defenceless head both Death and I
Am found eternal and incorporate both
Nor I on my part single in me all
Posterity stands cursed  Fair patrimony
That I must leave ye Sons  O were I able
To waste it all myself and leave ye none
So disinherited how would you bless
Me now your curse  Ah why should all mankind
For one mans fault thus guiltless be condemned
It guiltless?  But from me what can proceed
But all corrupt both mind and will depraved
Not to do only but to will the same
With me?  How can they then acquitted stand
In sight of God?  Him after all disputes
Forced I absolve all my evasions vain
And reasonings though through mazes lead me still
But to my own conviction first and last
On me me only as the source and spring
Of all corruption all the blame lights due
So might the wrath  Fond wishcouldst thou support
That burden heavier than the earth to bear
Than all the world much heavier though divided
With that bad Woman?  Thus what thou desirest
And what thou fearest alike destroys all hope
Of refuge and concludes thee miserable
Beyond all past example and future
To Satan only like both crime and doom
O Conscience into what abyss of fears
And horrours hast thou driven me out of which
I find no way from deep to deeper plunged
Thus Adam to himself lamented loud
Through the still night not now as ere Man fell
Wholesome and cool and mild but with black air
Accompanied with damps and dreadful gloom
Which to his evil conscience represented
All things with double terrour  On the ground
Outstretched he lay on the cold ground and oft
Cursed his creation  Death as oft accused
Of tardy execution since denounced
The day of his offence  Why comes not Death
Said he with one thriceacceptable stroke
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word
Justice Divine not hasten to be just?
But Death comes not at call Justice Divine
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries
O woods O fountains hillocks dales and bowers
With other echo late I taught your shades
To answer and resound far other song
Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld
Desolate where she sat approaching nigh
Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed
But her with stern regard he thus repelled
Out of my sight thou Serpent  That name best
Befits thee with him leagued thyself as false
And hateful nothing wants but that thy shape
Like his and colour serpentine may show
Thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
Henceforth lest that too heavenly form pretended
To hellish falshood snare them  But for thee
I had persisted happy had not thy pride
And wandering vanity when least was safe
Rejected my forewarning and disdained
Not to be trusted longing to be seen
Though by the Devil himself him overweening
To overreach but with the serpent meeting
Fooled and beguiled by him thou I by thee
To trust thee from my side imagined wise
Constant mature proof against all assaults
And understood not all was but a show
Rather than solid virtue all but a rib
Crooked by nature bent as now appears
More to the part sinister from me drawn
Well if thrown out as supernumerary
To my just number found  O why did God
Creator wise that peopled highest Heaven
With Spirits masculine create at last
This novelty on earth this fair defect
Of nature and not fill the world at once
With Men as Angels without feminine
Or find some other way to generate
Mankind?  This mischief had not been befallen
And more that shall befall innumerable
Disturbances on earth through female snares
And strait conjunction with this sex for either
He never shall find out fit mate but such
As some misfortune brings him or mistake
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
Through her perverseness but shall see her gained
By a far worse or if she love withheld
By parents or his happiest choice too late
Shall meet already linked and wedlockbound
To a fell adversary his hate or shame
Which infinite calamity shall cause
To human life and houshold peace confound
He added not and from her turned but Eve
Not so repulsed with tears that ceased not flowing
And tresses all disordered at his feet
Fell humble and embracing them besought
His peace and thus proceeded in her plaint
Forsake me not thus Adam witness Heaven
What love sincere and reverence in my heart
I bear thee and unweeting have offended
Unhappily deceived  Thy suppliant
I beg and clasp thy knees bereave me not
Whereon I live thy gentle looks thy aid
Thy counsel in this uttermost distress
My only strength and stay  Forlorn of thee
Whither shall I betake me where subsist?
While yet we live scarce one short hour perhaps
Between us two let there be peace both joining
As joined in injuries one enmity
Against a foe by doom express assigned us
That cruel Serpent  On me exercise not
Thy hatred for this misery befallen
On me already lost me than thyself
More miserable  Both have sinnedbut thou
Against God only I against God and thee
And to the place of judgement will return
There with my cries importune Heaven that all
The sentence from thy head removed may light
On me sole cause to thee of all this woe
Me me only just object of his ire
She ended weeping and her lowly plight
Immoveable till peace obtained from fault
Acknowledged and deplored in Adam wrought
Commiseration  Soon his heart relented
Towards her his life so late and sole delight
Now at his feet submissive in distress
Creature so fair his reconcilement seeking
His counsel whom she had displeased his aid
As one disarmed his anger all he lost
And thus with peaceful words upraised her soon
Unwary and too desirous as before
So now of what thou knowest not who desirest
The punishment all on thyself alas
Bear thine own first ill able to sustain
His full wrath whose thou feelest as yet least part
And my displeasure bearest so ill  If prayers
Could alter high decrees I to that place
Would speed before thee and be louder heard
That on my head all might be visited
Thy frailty and infirmer sex forgiven
To me committed and by me exposed
But riselet us no more contend nor blame
Each other blamed enough elsewhere but strive
In offices of love how we may lighten
Each others burden in our share of woe
Since this days death denounced if aught I see
Will prove no sudden but a slowpaced evil
A long days dying to augment our pain
And to our seed O hapless seed derived
To whom thus Eve recovering heart replied
Adam by sad experiment I know
How little weight my words with thee can find
Found so erroneous thence by just event
Found so unfortunate  Nevertheless
Restored by thee vile as I am to place
Of new acceptance hopeful to regain
Thy love the sole contentment of my heart
Living or dying from thee I will not hide
What thoughts in my unquiet breast are risen
Tending to some relief of our extremes
Or end though sharp and sad yet tolerable
As in our evils and of easier choice
If care of our descent perplex us most
Which must be born to certain woe devoured
By Death at last and miserable it is
To be to others cause of misery
Our own begotten and of our loins to bring
Into this cursed world a woeful race
That after wretched life must be at last
Food for so foul a monster in thy power
It lies yet ere conception to prevent
The race unblest to being yet unbegot
Childless thou art childless remain so Death
Shall be deceived his glut and with us two
