	melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs
	More I prithee more

AMIENS	My voice is ragged I know I cannot please you

JAQUES	I do not desire you to please me I do desire you to
	sing Come more another stanzo call you em stanzos?

AMIENS	What you will Monsieur Jaques

JAQUES	Nay I care not for their names they owe me
	nothing Will you sing?

AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself

JAQUES	Well then if ever I thank any man Ill thank you
	but that they call compliment is like the encounter
	of two dogapes and when a man thanks me heartily
	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
	the beggarly thanks Come sing and you that will
	not hold your tongues

AMIENS	Well Ill end the song Sirs cover the while the
	duke will drink under this tree He hath been all
	this day to look you

JAQUES	And I have been all this day to avoid him He is
	too disputable for my company I think of as many
	matters as he but I give heaven thanks and make no
	boast of them Come warble come

	SONG
	Who doth ambition shun

	All together here

	And loves to live i the sun
	Seeking the food he eats
	And pleased with what he gets
	Come hither come hither come hither
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather

JAQUES	Ill give you a verse to this note that I made
	yesterday in despite of my invention

AMIENS	And Ill sing it

JAQUES	Thus it goes

	If it do come to pass
	That any man turn ass
	Leaving his wealth and ease
	A stubborn will to please
	Ducdame ducdame ducdame
	Here shall he see
	Gross fools as he
	An if he will come to me

AMIENS	Whats that ducdame?

JAQUES	Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a
	circle Ill go sleep if I can if I cannot Ill
	rail against all the firstborn of Egypt

AMIENS	And Ill go seek the duke his banquet is prepared

	Exeunt severally

	For my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at
	the arms end I will here be with thee presently
	and if I bring thee not something to eat I will
	give thee leave to die but if thou diest before I
	come thou art a mocker of my labour Well said
	thou lookest cheerly and Ill be with thee quickly
	Yet thou liest in the bleak air come I will bear
	thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for
	lack of a dinner if there live any thing in this
