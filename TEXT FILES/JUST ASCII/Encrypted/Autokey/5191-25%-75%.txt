India Economy

Overview
    Indias economy is a mixture of traditional village farming and handicrafts
    modern agriculture old and new branches of industry and a multitude of
    support services It presents both the entrepreneurial skills and drives of
    the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the
    socialist mold Growth of  annually in the s has softened the impact
    of population growth on unemployment social tranquility and the
    environment Agricultural output has continued to expand reflecting the
    greater use of modern farming techniques and improved seed that have helped
    to make India selfsufficient in food grains and a net agricultural
    exporter However tens of millions of villagers particularly in the south
    have not benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty and
    great numbers of urban residents lack the basic essentials of life Industry
    has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls The growth rate of
    the service sector has also been strong India however has been challenged
    more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves higher inflation and
    a large debt service burden

    staple crop is rice Once the worlds largest rice importer Indonesia is
    now nearly selfsufficient Plantation crops  rubber and palm oil  and
    textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
    generation Industrial output now accounts for  of GDP and is based on a
    supply of diverse natural resources including crude oil natural gas
    timber metals and coal Of these the oil sector dominates the externaE
