A mercyseat of gold between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim before him burn
Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing
The heavenly fires over the tent a cloud
Shall rest by day a fiery gleam by night
Save when they journey and at length they come
Conducted by his Angel to the land
Promised to Abraham and his seedThe rest
Were long to tell how many battles fought
How many kings destroyed and kingdoms won
Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still
A day entire and nights due course adjourn
Mans voice commanding Sun in Gibeon stand
And thou moon in the vale of Aialon
Till Israel overcome so call the third
From Abraham son of Isaac and from him
His whole descent who thus shall Canaan win
Here Adam interposed  O sent from Heaven
Enlightener of my darkness gracious things
Thou hast revealed those chiefly which concern
Just Abraham and his seed now first I find
Mine eyes trueopening and my heart much eased
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become
Of me and all mankind  But now I see
His day in whom all nations shall be blest
Favour unmerited by me who sought
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means
This yet I apprehend not why to those
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth
So many and so various laws are given
So many laws argue so many sins
Among them how can God with such reside?
To whom thus Michael  Doubt not but that sin
Will reign among them as of thee begot
And therefore was law given them to evince
Their natural pravity by stirring up
Sin against law to fight that when they see
Law can discover sin but not remove
Save by those shadowy expiations weak
The blood of bulls and goats they may conclude
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man
Just for unjust that in such righteousness
To them by faith imputed they may find
Justification towards God and peace
Of conscience which the law by ceremonies
Cannot appease nor Man the mortal part
Perform and not performing cannot live
So law appears imperfect and but given
With purpose to resign them in full time
Up to a better covenant disciplined
From shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit
From imposition of strict laws to free
Acceptance of large grace from servile fear
To filial works of law to works of faith
And therefore shall not Moses though of God
Highly beloved being but the minister
Of law his people into Canaan lead
But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call
His name and office bearing who shall quell
The adversarySerpent and bring back
Through the worlds wilderness longwandered Man
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest
Mean while they in their earthly Canaan placed
Long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins
National interrupt their publick peace
Provoking God to raise them enemies
From whom as oft he saves them penitent
By Judges first then under Kings of whom
The second both for piety renowned
And puissant deeds a promise shall receive
Irrevocable that his regal throne
For ever shall endure the like shall sing
All Prophecy that of the royal stock
Of David so I name this king shall rise
A Son the Womans seed to thee foretold
Foretold to Abraham as in whom shall trust
All nations and to kings foretold of kings
The last for of his reign shall be no end
But first a long succession must ensue
And his next son for wealth and wisdom famed
The clouded ark of God till then in tents
Wandering shall in a glorious temple enshrine
Such follow him as shall be registered
Part good part bad of bad the longer scroll
Whose foul idolatries and other faults
Heaped to the popular sum will so incense
God as to leave them and expose their land
Their city his temple and his holy ark
With all his sacred things a scorn and prey
To that proud city whose high walls thou sawest
Left in confusion Babylon thence called
There in captivity he lets them dwell
The space of seventy years then brings them back
Remembering mercy and his covenant sworn
To David stablished as the days of Heaven
Returned from Babylon by leave of kings
Their lords whom God disposed the house of God
They first reedify and for a while
In mean estate live moderate till grown
In wealth and multitude factious they grow
But first among the priests dissention springs
Men who attend the altar and should most
Endeavour peace their strife pollution brings
Upon the temple itself at last they seise
The scepter and regard not Davids sons
Then lose it to a stranger that the true
Anointed King Messiah might be born
Barred of his right yet at his birth a star
Unseen before in Heaven proclaims him come
And guides the eastern sages who inquire
His place to offer incense myrrh and gold
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
To simple shepherds keeping watch by night
They gladly thither haste and by a quire
Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung
A virgin is his mother but his sire
The power of the Most High  He shall ascend
The throne hereditary and bound his reign
With Earths wide bounds his glory with the Heavens
He ceased discerning Adam with such joy
Surcharged as had like grief been dewed in tears
Without the vent of words which these he breathed
O prophet of glad tidings finisher
Of utmost hope now clear I understand
What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain
Why our great Expectation should be called
The seed of Woman  Virgin Mother hail
High in the love of Heaven yet from my loins
Thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the Son
Of God Most High so God with Man unites
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise
Expect with mortal pain  Say where and when
Their fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel
To whom thus Michael  Dream not of their fight
As of a duel or the local wounds
Of head or heel  Not therefore joins the Son
Manhood to Godhead with more strength to foil
Thy enemy nor so is overcome
Satan whose fall from Heaven a deadlier bruise
Disabled not to give thee thy deaths wound
Which he who comes thy Saviour shall recure
Not by destroying Satan but his works
In thee and in thy seed  Nor can this be
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want
Obedience to the law of God imposed
On penalty of death and suffering death
The penalty to thy transgression due
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow
So only can high Justice rest appaid
The law of God exact he shall fulfil
Both by obedience and by love though love
Alone fulfil the law thy punishment
He shall endure by coming in the flesh
To a reproachful life and cursed death
Proclaiming life to all who shall believe
In his redemption and that his obedience
Imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits
To save them not their own though legal works
For this he shall live hated be blasphemed
Seised on by force judged and to death condemned
A shameful and accursed nailed to the cross
By his own nation slain for bringing life
But to the cross he nails thy enemies
The law that is against thee and the sins
Of all mankind with him there crucified
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
In this his satisfaction so he dies
But soon revives Death over him no power
Shall long usurp ere the third dawning light
Return the stars of morn shall see him rise
Out of his grave fresh as the dawning light
Thy ransom paid which Man from death redeems
His death for Man as many as offered life
Neglect not and the benefit embrace
By faith not void of works  This Godlike act
Annuls thy doom the death thou shouldest have died
In sin for ever lost from life this act
Shall bruise the head of Satan crush his strength
Defeating Sin and Death his two main arms
And fix far deeper in his head their stings
Than temporal death shall bruise the victors heel
Or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep
A gentle wafting to immortal life
Nor after resurrection shall he stay
Longer on earth than certain times to appear
To his disciples men who in his life
Still followed him to them shall leave in charge
To teach all nations what of him they learned
And his salvation them who shall believe
Baptizing in the profluent stream the sign
Of washing them from guilt of sin to life
Pure and in mind prepared if so befall
For death like that which the Redeemer died
All nations they shall teach for from that day
Not only to the sons of Abrahams loins
Salvation shall be preached but to the sons
Of Abrahams faith wherever through the world
So in his seed all nations shall be blest
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend
With victory triumphing through the air
Over his foes and thine there shall surprise
The Serpent prince of air and drag in chains
Through all his realm and there confounded leave
Then enter into glory and resume
His seat at Gods right hand exalted high
Above all names in Heaven and thence shall come
When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe
With glory and power to judge both quick and dead
To judge the unfaithful dead but to reward
His faithful and receive them into bliss
Whether in Heaven or Earth for then the Earth
Shall all be Paradise far happier place
Than this of Eden and far happier days
So spake the ArchAngel Michael then paused
As at the worlds great period and our sire
Replete with joy and wonder thus replied
O Goodness infinite Goodness immense
That all this good of evil shall produce
And evil turn to good more wonderful
Than that which by creation first brought forth
Light out of darkness  Full of doubt I stand
Whether I should repent me now of sin
By me done and occasioned or rejoice
Much more that much more good thereof shall spring
To God more glory more goodwill to Men
From God and over wrath grace shall abound
But say if our Deliverer up to Heaven
Must reascend what will betide the few
His faithful left among the unfaithful herd
The enemies of truth?  Who then shall guide
His people who defend?  Will they not deal
Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?
Be sure they will said the Angel but from Heaven
He to his own a Comforter will send
The promise of the Father who shall dwell
His Spirit within them and the law of faith
Working through love upon their hearts shall write
To guide them in all truth and also arm
With spiritual armour able to resist
Satans assaults and quench his fiery darts
What man can do against them not afraid
Though to the death against such cruelties
With inward consolations recompensed
And oft supported so as shall amaze
Their proudest persecutors  For the Spirit
Poured first on his Apostles whom he sends
To evangelize the nations then on all
Baptized shall them with wonderous gifts endue
To speak all tongues and do all miracles
As did their Lord before them  Thus they win
Great numbers of each nation to receive
With joy the tidings brought from Heaven  At length
Their ministry performed and race well run
Their doctrine and their story written left
They die but in their room as they forewarn
Wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven
To their own vile advantages shall turn
Of lucre and ambition and the truth
With superstitions and traditions taint
Left only in those written records pure
Though not but by the Spirit understood
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names
Places and titles and with these to join
Secular power though feigning still to act
By spiritual to themselves appropriating
The Spirit of God promised alike and given
To all believers and from that pretence
Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force
On every conscience laws which none shall find
Left them inrolled or what the Spirit within
Shall on the heart engrave  What will they then
But force the Spirit of Grace itself and bind
His consort Liberty? what but unbuild
His living temples built by faith to stand
Their own faith not anothers? for on earth
Who against faith and conscience can be heard
Infallible? yet many will presume
Whence heavy persecution shall arise
On all who in the worship persevere
Of spirit and truth the rest far greater part
Will deem in outward rites and specious forms
Religion satisfied Truth shall retire
Bestuck with slanderous darts and works of faith
Rarely be found  So shall the world go on
To good malignant to bad men benign
Under her own weight groaning till the day
Appear of respiration to the just
And vengeance to the wicked at return
Of him so lately promised to thy aid
The Womans Seed obscurely then foretold
Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord
Last in the clouds from Heaven to be revealed
In glory of the Father to dissolve
Satan with his perverted world then raise
From the conflagrant mass purged and refined
New Heavens new Earth ages of endless date
Founded in righteousness and peace and love
To bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss
He ended and thus Adam last replied
How soon hath thy prediction Seer blest
Measured this transient world the race of time
Till time stand fixed  Beyond is all abyss
Eternity whose end no eye can reach
Greatlyinstructed I shall hence depart
Greatly in peace of thought and have my fill
Of knowledge what this vessel can contain
Beyond which was my folly to aspire
Henceforth I learn that to obey is best
And love with fear the only God to walk
As in his presence ever to observe
His providence and on him sole depend
Merciful over all his works with good
Still overcoming evil and by small
Accomplishing great things by things deemed weak
Subverting worldly strong and worldly wise
By simply meek that suffering for truths sake
Is fortitude to highest victory
And to the faithful death the gate of life
Taught this by his example whom I now
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest
To whom thus also the Angel last replied
This having learned thou hast attained the sum
Of wisdom hope no higher though all the stars
Thou knewest by name and all the ethereal powers
All secrets of the deep all Natures works
Or works of God in Heaven air earth or sea
And all the riches of this world enjoyedst
And all the rule one empire only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith
Add virtue patience temperance add love
By name to come called charity the soul
Of all the rest then wilt thou not be loth
To leave this Paradise but shalt possess
A Paradise within thee happier far
Let us descend now therefore from this top
Of speculation for the hour precise
Exacts our parting hence and seethe guards
By me encamped on yonder hill expect
Their motion at whose front a flaming sword
In signal of remove waves fiercely round
We may no longer stay go waken Eve
Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed
Portending good and all her spirits composed
To meek submission thou at season fit
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard
Chiefly what may concern her faith to know
The great deliverance by her seed to come
For by the Womans seed on all mankind
That ye may live which will be many days
Both in one faith unanimous though sad
With cause for evils past yet much more cheered
With meditation on the happy end
He ended and they both descend the hill
Descended Adam to the bower where Eve
Lay sleeping ran before but found her waked
And thus with words not sad she him received
Whence thou returnest and whither wentest I know
For God is also in sleep and dreams advise
Which he hath sent propitious some great good
Presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress
Wearied I fell asleep  But now lead on
In me is no delay with thee to go
Is to stay here without thee here to stay
Is to go hence unwilling thou to me
Art all things under Heaven all places thou
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence
This further consolation yet secure
I carry hence though all by me is lost
Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore
So spake our mother Eve and Adam heard
Well pleased but answered not  For now too nigh
The ArchAngel stood and from the other hill
To their fixed station all in bright array
The Cherubim descended on the ground
Gliding meteorous as eveningmist
Risen from a river oer the marish glides
And gathers ground fast at the labourers heel
Homeward returning  High in front advanced
The brandished sword of God before them blazed
Fierce as a comet which with torrid heat
And vapour as the Libyan air adust
Began to parch that temperate clime whereat
In either hand the hastening Angel caught
Our lingering parents and to the eastern gate
Led them direct and down the cliff as fast
To the subjected plain then disappeared
They looking back all the eastern side beheld
Of Paradise so late their happy seat
Waved over by that flaming brand the gate
With dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms
Some natural tears they dropt but wiped them soon
The world was all before them where to choose
Their place of rest and Providence their guide
They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow
Through Eden took their solitary way
