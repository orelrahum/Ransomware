Hungary Economy

Overview
    Hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition between a command and a
    market economy Agriculture is an important sector providing sizable export
    earnings and meeting domestic food needs Industry accounts for about  of
    GDP and  of employment Hungary claims that less than  of foreign
    trade is now with former CEMA countries while about  is with OECD
    members Hungarys economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it
    a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment
    In  Hungary received half of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe
    and in  received the largest single share The growing private sector
    accounts for onequarter to onethird of national output according to
    unofficial estimates Privatization of state enterprises is progressing
    although excessive redtape bureaucratic oversight and uncertainties about
    pricing have slowed the process Escalating unemployment and high rates of
    inflation may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform
    while Hungarys heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to
    introduce full convertability of the forint before

Iceland Economy

Overview
    Icelands prosperous Scandinaviantype economy is basically capitalistic
    but with extensive welfare measures low unemployment and comparatively
    even distribution of income The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry which provides nearly  of export earnings In the absence of
    other natural resources Icelands economy is vulnerable to changing world
    fish prices The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
    in  and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
    plant The conservative governments economic priorities include reducing
    the budget and current account deficits containing inflation revising
    agricultural and fishing policies diversifying the economy and tying the
    krona to the ECs European currency unit in  The fishing industries 
    notably the shrimp industry  are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
    mergers Inflation has continued to drop sharply from  in  to about
     in  and possibly  in  while unemployment is expected to
    increase to  GDP is expected to contract by nearly  in
