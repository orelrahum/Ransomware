With trumpets regal sound the great result
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy
By heralds voice explained the hollow Abyss
Heard far adn wide and all the host of Hell
With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim
Thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised
By false presumptuous hope the ranged Powers
Disband and wandering each his several way
Pursues as inclination or sad choice
Leads him perplexed where he may likeliest find
Truce to his restless thoughts and entertain
The irksome hours till his great Chief return
Part on the plain or in the air sublime
Upon the wing or in swift race contend
As at th Olympian games or Pythian fields
Part curb their fiery steeds or shun the goal
With rapid wheels or fronted brigades form
As when to warn proud cities war appears
Waged in the troubled sky and armies rush
To battle in the clouds before each van
Prick forth the airy knights and couch their spears
Till thickest legions close with feats of arms
From either end of heaven the welkin burns
Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell
Rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air
In whirlwind Hell scarce holds the wild uproar
As when Alcides from Oechalia crowned
With conquest felt th envenomed robe and tore
Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines
And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw
Into th Euboic sea Others more mild
Retreated in a silent valley sing
With notes angelical to many a harp
Their own heroic deeds and hapless fall
By doom of battle and complain that Fate
Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance
Their song was partial but the harmony
What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?
Suspended Hell and took with ravishment
The thronging audience In discourse more sweet
For Eloquence the Soul Song charms the Sense
Others apart sat on a hill retired
In thoughts more elevate and reasoned high
Of Providence Foreknowledge Will and Fate
Fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute
And found no end in wandering mazes lost
Of good and evil much they argued then
Of happiness and final misery
Passion and apathy and glory and shame
Vain wisdom all and false philosophy
Yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm
Pain for a while or anguish and excite
Fallacious hope or arm th obdured breast
With stubborn patience as with triple steel
Another part in squadrons and gross bands
On bold adventure to discover wide
That dismal world if any clime perhaps
Might yield them easier habitation bend
Four ways their flying march along the banks
Of four infernal rivers that disgorge
Into the burning lake their baleful streams
Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate
Sad Acheron of sorrow black and deep
Cocytus named of lamentation loud
Heard on the rueful stream fierce Phlegeton
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage
Far off from these a slow and silent stream
Lethe the river of oblivion rolls
Her watery labyrinth whereof who drinks
Forthwith his former state and being forgets
Forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain
Beyond this flood a frozen continent
Lies dark and wild beat with perpetual storms
Of whirlwind and dire hail which on firm land
Thaws not but gathers heap and ruin seems
Of ancient pile all else deep snow and ice
A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog
Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old
Where armies whole have sunk the parching air
Burns frore and cold performs th effect of fire
Thither by harpyfooted Furies haled
At certain revolutions all the damned
Are brought and feel by turns the bitter change
Of fierce extremes extremes by change more fierce
From beds of raging fire to starve in ice
Their soft ethereal warmth and there to pine
Immovable infixed and frozen round
Periods of timethence hurried back to fire
They ferry over this Lethean sound
Both to and fro their sorrow to augment
And wish and struggle as they pass to reach
The tempting stream with one small drop to lose
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe
All in one moment and so near the brink
But Fate withstands and to oppose th attempt
Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards
The ford and of itself the water flies
All taste of living wight as once it fled
The lip of Tantalus Thus roving on
In confused march forlorn th adventurous bands
With shuddering horror pale and eyes aghast
Viewed first their lamentable lot and found
No rest Through many a dark and dreary vale
They passed and many a region dolorous
Oer many a frozen many a fiery alp
Rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death
A universe of death which God by curse
Created evil for evil only good
Where all life dies death lives and Nature breeds
Perverse all monstrous all prodigious things
Obominable inutterable and worse
Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived
Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire
  Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man
Satan with thoughts inflamed of highest design
Puts on swift wings and toward the gates of Hell
Explores his solitary flight sometimes
He scours the right hand coast sometimes the left
Now shaves with level wing the deep then soars
Up to the fiery concave towering high
As when far off at sea a fleet descried
Hangs in the clouds by equinoctial winds
Close sailing from Bengala or the isles
Of Ternate and Tidore whence merchants bring
Their spicy drugs they on the trading flood
Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape
Ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed
Far off the flying Fiend At last appear
Hellbounds high reaching to the horrid roof
And thrice threefold the gates three folds were brass
Three iron three of adamantine rock
Impenetrable impaled with circling fire
Yet unconsumed Before the gates there sat
On either side a formidable Shape
The one seemed woman to the waist and fair
But ended foul in many a scaly fold
Voluminous and vasta serpent armed
With mortal sting About her middle round
A cry of Hellhounds neverceasing barked
With wide Cerberean mouths full loud and rung
A hideous peal yet when they list would creep
If aught disturbed their noise into her womb
And kennel there yet there still barked and howled
Within unseen Far less abhorred than these
Vexed Scylla bathing in the sea that parts
Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore
Nor uglier follow the nighthag when called
In secret riding through the air she comes
Lured with the smell of infant blood to dance
With Lapland witches while the labouring moon
Eclipses at their charms The other Shape
If shape it might be called that shape had none
Distinguishable in member joint or limb
Or substance might be called that shadow seemed
For each seemed eitherblack it stood as Night
Fierce as ten Furies terrible as Hell
And shook a dreadful dart what seemed his head
The likeness of a kingly crown had on
Satan was now at hand and from his seat
The monster moving onward came as fast
With horrid strides Hell trembled as he strode
Th undaunted Fiend what this might be admired
Admired not feared God and his Son except
Created thing naught valued he nor shunned
And with disdainful look thus first began
  "Whence and what art thou execrable Shape
That darst though grim and terrible advance
Thy miscreated front athwart my way
To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass
That be assured without leave asked of thee
Retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof
Hellborn not to contend with Spirits of Heaven"
  To whom the Goblin full of wrath replied
"Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he
Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith till then
Unbroken and in proud rebellious arms
Drew after him the third part of Heavens sons
Conjured against the Highestfor which both thou
And they outcast from God are here condemned
To waste eternal days in woe and pain?
And reckonst thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven
Helldoomed and breathst defiance here and scorn
Where I reign king and to enrage thee more
Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment
False fugitive and to thy speed add wings
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue
Thy lingering or with one stroke of this dart
Strange horror seize thee and pangs unfelt before"
  So spake the grisly Terror and in shape
So speaking and so threatening grew tenfold
More dreadful and deform On th other side
Incensed with indignation Satan stood
Unterrified and like a comet burned
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
In th arctic sky and from his horrid hair
Shakes pestilence and war Each at the head
Levelled his deadly aim their fatal hands
No second stroke intend and such a frown
Each cast at th other as when two black clouds
With heavens artillery fraught came rattling on
Over the Caspianthen stand front to front
Hovering a space till winds the signal blow
To join their dark encounter in midair
So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell
Grew darker at their frown so matched they stood
For never but once more was wither like
To meet so great a foe And now great deeds
Had been achieved whereof all Hell had rung
Had not the snaky Sorceress that sat
Fast by Hellgate and kept the fatal key
Risen and with hideous outcry rushed between
  "O father what intends thy hand" she cried
"Against thy only son? What fury O son
Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart
Against thy fathers head? And knowst for whom?
For him who sits above and laughs the while
At thee ordained his drudge to execute
Whateer his wrath which he calls justice bids
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both"
  She spake and at her words the hellish Pest
Forbore then these to her Satan returned
  "So strange thy outcry and thy words so strange
Thou interposest that my sudden hand
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
What it intends till first I know of thee
What thing thou art thus doubleformed and why
In this infernal vale first met thou callst
Me father and that phantasm callst my son
I know thee not nor ever saw till now
Sight more detestable than him and thee"
  T whom thus the Portress of Hellgate replied
"Hast thou forgot me then and do I seem
Now in thine eye so foul?once deemed so fair
In Heaven when at th assembly and in sight
Of all the Seraphim with thee combined
In bold conspiracy against Heavens King
All on a sudden miserable pain
Surprised thee dim thine eyes and dizzy swum
In darkness while thy head flames thick and fast
Threw forth till on the left side opening wide
Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright
Then shining heavenly fair a goddess armed
Out of thy head I sprung Amazement seized
All th host of Heaven back they recoiled afraid
At first and called me Sin and for a sign
Portentous held me but familiar grown
I pleased and with attractive graces won
The most aversethee chiefly who full oft
Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing
Becamst enamoured and such joy thou tookst
With me in secret that my womb conceived
A growing burden Meanwhile war arose
And fields were fought in Heaven wherein remained
For what could else? to our Almighty Foe
Clear victory to our part loss and rout
Through all the Empyrean Down they fell
Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven down
Into this Deep and in the general fall
I also at which time this powerful key
Into my hands was given with charge to keep
These gates for ever shut which none can pass
Without my opening Pensive here I sat
Alone but long I sat not till my womb
Pregnant by thee and now excessive grown
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest
Thine own begotten breaking violent way
Tore through my entrails that with fear and pain
Distorted all my nether shape thus grew
Transformed but he my inbred enemy
Forth issued brandishing his fatal dart
Made to destroy I fled and cried out Death
Hell trembled at the hideous name and sighed
From all her caves and back resounded Death
I fled but he pursued though more it seems
Inflamed with lust than rage and swifter far
Me overtook his mother all dismayed
And in embraces forcible and foul
Engendering with me of that rape begot
These yelling monsters that with ceaseless cry
Surround me as thou sawsthourly conceived
And hourly born with sorrow infinite
To me for when they list into the womb
That bred them they return and howl and gnaw
My bowels their repast then bursting forth
Afresh with conscious terrors vex me round
That rest or intermission none I find
Before mine eyes in opposition sits
Grim Death my son and foe who set them on
And me his parent would full soon devour
For want of other prey but that he knows
His end with mine involved and knows that I
Should prove a bitter morsel and his bane
Whenever that shall be so Fate pronounced
But thou O father I forewarn thee shun
His deadly arrow neither vainly hope
To be invulnerable in those bright arms
Through tempered heavenly for that mortal dint
Save he who reigns above none can resist"
  She finished and the subtle Fiend his lore
Soon learned now milder and thus answered smooth
  "Dear daughtersince thou claimst me for thy sire
And my fair son here showst me the dear pledge
Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven and joys
Then sweet now sad to mention through dire change
Befallen us unforeseen unthoughtofknow
I come no enemy but to set free
From out this dark and dismal house of pain
Both him and thee and all the heavenly host
Of Spirits that in our just pretences armed
Fell with us from on high From them I go
This uncouth errand sole and one for all
Myself expose with lonely steps to tread
Th unfounded Deep and through the void immense
To search with wandering quest a place foretold
Should beand by concurring signs ere now
Created vast and rounda place of bliss
In the purlieus of Heaven and therein placed
A race of upstart creatures to supply
Perhaps our vacant room though more removed
Lest Heaven surcharged with potent multitude
Might hap to move new broils Be this or aught
Than this more secret now designed I haste
To know and this once known shall soon return
And bring ye to the place where thou and Death
Shall dwell at ease and up and down unseen
Wing silently the buxom air embalmed
With odours There ye shall be fed and filled
Immeasurably all things shall be your prey"
  He ceased for both seemed highly pleased and Death
Grinned horrible a ghastly smile to hear
His famine should be filled and blessed his maw
Destined to that good hour No less rejoiced
His mother bad and thus bespake her sire
  "The key of this infernal Pit by due
And by command of Heavens allpowerful King
I keep by him forbidden to unlock
These adamantine gates against all force
Death ready stands to interpose his dart
Fearless to be oermatched by living might
But what owe I to his commands above
Who hates me and hath hither thrust me down
Into this gloom of Tartarus profound
To sit in hateful office here confined
Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born
Here in perpetual agony and pain
With terrors and with clamours compassed round
Of mine own brood that on my bowels feed?
Thou art my father thou my author thou
My being gavst me whom should I obey
But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon
To that new world of light and bliss among
The gods who live at ease where I shall reign
At thy right hand voluptuous as beseems
Thy daughter and thy darling without end"
  Thus saying from her side the fatal key
Sad instrument of all our woe she took
And towards the gate rolling her bestial train
Forthwith the huge portcullis high updrew
Which but herself not all the Stygian Powers
Could once have moved then in the keyhole turns
Th intricate wards and every bolt and bar
Of massy iron or solid rock with ease
Unfastens On a sudden open fly
With impetuous recoil and jarring sound
Th infernal doors and on their hinges grate
Harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shook
Of Erebus She opened but to shut
Excelled her power the gates wide open stood
That with extended wings a bannered host
Under spread ensigns marching mibht pass through
With horse and chariots ranked in loose array
So wide they stood and like a furnacemouth
Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame
Before their eyes in sudden view appear
The secrets of the hoary Deepa dark
Illimitable ocean without bound
Without dimension where length breadth and height
And time and place are lost where eldest Night
And Chaos ancestors of Nature hold
Eternal anarchy amidst the noise
Of endless wars and by confusion stand
For Hot Cold Moist and Dry four champions fierce
Strive here for mastery and to battle bring
Their embryon atoms they around the flag
Of each his faction in their several clans
Lightarmed or heavy sharp smooth swift or slow
Swarm populous unnumbered as the sands
Of Barca or Cyrenes torrid soil
Levied to side with warring winds and poise
Their lighter wings To whom these most adhere
He rules a moment Chaos umpire sits
And by decision more embroils the fray
By which he reigns next him high arbiter
Chance governs all Into this wild Abyss
The womb of Nature and perhaps her grave
Of neither sea nor shore nor air nor fire
But all these in their pregnant causes mixed
Confusedly and which thus must ever fight
Unless th Almighty Maker them ordain
His dark materials to create more worlds
Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend
Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while
Pondering his voyage for no narrow frith
He had to cross Nor was his ear less pealed
With noises loud and ruinous to compare
Great things with small than when Bellona storms
With all her battering engines bent to rase
Some capital city or less than if this frame
Of Heaven were falling and these elements
In mutiny had from her axle torn
The steadfast Earth At last his sailbroad vans
He spread for flight and in the surging smoke
Uplifted spurns the ground thence many a league
As in a cloudy chair ascending rides
Audacious but that seat soon failing meets
A vast vacuity All unawares
Fluttering his pennons vain plumbdown he drops
Ten thousand fathom deep and to this hour
Down had been falling had not by ill chance
The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud
Instinct with fire and nitre hurried him
As many miles aloft That fury stayed
Quenched in a boggy Syrtis neither sea
Nor good dry landnigh foundered on he fares
Treading the crude consistence half on foot
Half flying behoves him now both oar and sail
As when a gryphon through the wilderness
With winged course oer hill or moory dale
Pursues the Arimaspian who by stealth
Had from his wakeful custody purloined
The guarded gold so eagerly the Fiend
Oer bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare
With head hands wings or feet pursues his way
And swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies
At length a universal hubbub wild
Of stunning sounds and voices all confused
Borne through the hollow dark assaults his ear
With loudest vehemence Thither he plies
Undaunted to meet there whatever Power
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
Might in that noise reside of whom to ask
Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
Bordering on light when straight behold the throne
Of Chaos and his dark pavilion spread
Wide on the wasteful Deep With him enthroned
Sat sablevested Night eldest of things
The consort of his reign and by them stood
Orcus and Ades and the dreaded name
Of Demogorgon Rumour next and Chance
And Tumult and Confusion all embroiled
And Discord with a thousand various mouths
  T whom Satan turning boldly thus"Ye Powers
And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss
Chaos and ancient Night I come no spy
With purpose to explore or to disturb
The secrets of your realm but by constraint
Wandering this darksome desert as my way
Lies through your spacious empire up to light
Alone and without guide half lost I seek
What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds
Confine with Heaven or if some other place
From your dominion won th Ethereal King
Possesses lately thither to arrive
I travel this profound Direct my course
Directed no mean recompense it brings
To your behoof if I that region lost
All usurpation thence expelled reduce
To her original darkness and your sway
Which is my present journey and once more
Erect the standard there of ancient Night
Yours be th advantage all mine the revenge"
  Thus Satan and him thus the Anarch old
With faltering speech and visage incomposed
Answered  "I know thee stranger who thou art  
That mighty leading Angel who of late
Made head against Heavens King though overthrown
I saw and heard for such a numerous host
Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep
With ruin upon ruin rout on rout
Confusion worse confounded and Heavengates
Poured out by millions her victorious bands
Pursuing I upon my frontiers here
Keep residence if all I can will serve
That little which is left so to defend
Encroached on still through our intestine broils
Weakening the sceptre of old Night first Hell
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath
Now lately Heaven and Earth another world
Hung oer my realm linked in a golden chain
To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell
If that way be your walk you have not far
So much the nearer danger Go and speed
Havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain"
  He ceased and Satan stayed not to reply
But glad that now his sea should find a shore
With fresh alacrity and force renewed
Springs upward like a pyramid of fire
Into the wild expanse and through the shock
Of fighting elements on all sides round
Environed wins his way harder beset
And more endangered than when Argo passed
Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks
Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned
Charybdis and by th other whirlpool steered
So he with difficulty and labour hard
Moved on with difficulty and labour he
But he once passed soon after when Man fell
Strange alteration Sin and Death amain
Following his track such was the will of Heaven
Paved after him a broad and beaten way
Over the dark Abyss whose boiling gulf
Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length
From Hell continued reaching th utmost orb
Of this frail World by which the Spirits perverse
With easy intercourse pass to and fro
To tempt or punish mortals except whom
God and good Angels guard by special grace
  But now at last the sacred influence
Of light appears and from the walls of Heaven
Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night
A glimmering dawn Here Nature first begins
Her farthest verge and Chaos to retire
As from her outmost works a broken foe
With tumult less and with less hostile din
That Satan with less toil and now with ease
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
And like a weatherbeaten vessel holds
Gladly the port though shrouds and tackle torn
Or in the emptier waste resembling air
Weighs his spread wings at leisure to behold
Far off th empyreal Heaven extended wide
In circuit undetermined square or round
With opal towers and battlements adorned
Of living sapphire once his native seat
And fast by hanging in a golden chain
This pendent World in bigness as a star
Of smallest magnitude close by the moon
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge
Accursed and in a cursed hour he hies



Book III


Hail holy Light offspring of Heaven firstborn
Or of the Eternal coeternal beam
May I express thee unblamd?  since God is light
And never but in unapproached light
Dwelt from eternity dwelt then in thee
Bright effluence of bright essence increate
Or hear"st thou rather pure ethereal stream
Whose fountain who shall tell?  before the sun
Before the Heavens thou wert and at the voice
Of God as with a mantle didst invest  
The rising world of waters dark and deep
Won from the void and formless infinite
Thee I revisit now with bolder wing
Escapd the Stygian pool though long detaind
In that obscure sojourn while in my flight
Through utter and through middle darkness borne
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre
I sung of Chaos and eternal Night
Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down
The dark descent and up to reascend
Though hard and rare  Thee I revisit safe
And feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou
Revisitst not these eyes that roll in vain
To find thy piercing ray and find no dawn
So  thick a drop serene hath quenchd their orbs
Or dim suffusion veild  Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
Clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill
Smit with the love of sacred song but chief
Thee Sion and the flowery brooks beneath
That wash thy hallowd feet and warbling flow
Nightly I visit  nor sometimes forget
So were I equalld with them in renown
Thy sovran command that Man should find grace
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides
And Tiresias and Phineus prophets old
Then feed on thoughts that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird
Sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid
Tunes her nocturnal note  Thus with the year
Seasons return but not to me returns
Day or the sweet approach of even or morn
Or sight of vernal bloom or summers rose
Or flocks or herds or human face divine
But cloud instead and everduring dark
Surrounds me from the cheerful ways of men
Cut off and for the book of knowledge fair
Presented with a universal blank
Of natures works to me expungd and rasd
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out
So much the rather thou celestial Light
Shine inward and the mind through all her powers
Irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence
Purge and disperse that I may see and tell
Of things invisible to mortal sight
Now had the Almighty Father from above
From the pure empyrean where he sits
High thrond above all highth bent down his eye
His own works and their works at once to view
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
Stood thick as stars and from his sight receivd
Beatitude past utterance on his right
The radiant image of his glory sat
His only son on earth he first beheld
Our two first parents yet the only two
Of mankind in the happy garden placd
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love
Uninterrupted joy unrivalld love
In blissful solitude he then surveyd
Hell and the gulf between and Satan there
Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night
In the dun air sublime and ready now
To stoop with wearied wings and willing feet
On the bare outside of this world that seemd
Firm land imbosomd without firmament
Uncertain which in ocean or in air
Him God beholding from his prospect high
Wherein past present future he beholds
Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake
Only begotten Son seest thou what rage
Transports our Adversary?  whom no bounds
Prescribd no bars of Hell nor all the chains
Heapd on him there nor yet the main abyss
Wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems
On desperate revenge that shall redound
Upon his own rebellious head  And now
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
Not far off Heaven in the precincts of light
Directly towards the new created world
And man there placd with purpose to assay
If him by force he can destroy or worse
By some false guile pervert and shall pervert
For man will hearken to his glozing lies
And easily transgress the sole command
Sole pledge of his obedience  So will fall
He and his faithless progeny  Whose fault?
Whose but his own?  ingrate he had of me
All he could have I made him just and right
Sufficient to have stood though free to fall
Such I created all the ethereal Powers
And Spirits both them who stood and them who faild
Freely they stood who stood and fell who fell
Not free what proof could they have given sincere
Of true allegiance constant faith or love
Where only what they needs must do appeard
Not what they would?  what praise could they receive?
What pleasure I from such obedience paid
When will and reason reason also is choice
Useless and vain of freedom both despoild
Made passive both had servd necessity
Not me?  they therefore as to right belong d
So were created nor can justly accuse
Their Maker or their making or their fate
As if predestination overruld
Their will disposd by absolute decree
Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed
Their own revolt not I if I foreknew
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault
Which had no less proved certain unforeknown
So without least impulse or shadFO VF IOPS
