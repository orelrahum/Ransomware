Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt
With thee thy manhood also to this throne
Here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt reign
Both God and Man Son both of God and Man
Anointed universal King all power
I give thee reign for ever and assume
Thy merits under thee as head supreme
Thrones Princedoms Powers Dominions I reduce
All knees to thee shall bow of them that bide
In Heaven or Earth or under Earth in Hell
When thou attended gloriously from Heaven
Shalt in the sky appear and from thee send
The summoning ArchAngels to proclaim
Thy dread tribunal forthwith from all winds
The living and forthwith the cited dead
Of all past ages to the general doom
Shall hasten such a peal shall rouse their sleep
Then all thy saints assembled thou shalt judge
Bad Men and Angels they arraigned shall sink
Beneath thy sentence Hell her numbers full
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut  Mean while
The world shall burn and from her ashes spring
New Heaven and Earth wherein the just shall dwell
And after all their tribulations long
See golden days fruitful of golden deeds
With joy and peace triumphing and fair truth
Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by
For regal scepter then no more shall need
God shall be all in all  But all ye Gods
Adore him who to compass all this dies
Adore the Son and honour him as me
No sooner had the Almighty ceased but all
The multitude of Angels with a shout
Loud as from numbers without number sweet
As from blest voices uttering joy Heaven rung
With jubilee and loud Hosannas filled
The eternal regions  Lowly reverent
Towards either throne they bow and to the ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold
Immortal amarant a flower which once
In Paradise fast by the tree of life
Began to bloom but soon for mans offence
To Heaven removed where first it grew there grows
And flowers aloft shading the fount of life
And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven
Rolls oer Elysian flowers her amber stream
With these that never fade the Spirits elect
Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams
Now in loose garlands thick thrown off the bright
Pavement that like a sea of jasper shone
Impurpled with celestial roses smiled
Then crowned again their golden harps they took
Harps ever tuned that glittering by their side
Like quivers hung and with preamble sweet
Of charming symphony they introduce
Their sacred song and waken raptures high
No voice exempt no voice but well could join
Melodious part such concord is in Heaven
Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent
Immutable Immortal Infinite
Eternal King the Author of all being
Fonntain of light thyself invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitst
Throned inaccessible but when thou shadest
The full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear
Yet dazzle Heaven that brightest Seraphim
Approach not but with both wings veil their eyes
Thee next they sang of all creation first
Begotten Son Divine Similitude
In whose conspicuous countenance without cloud
Made visible the Almighty Father shines
Whom else no creature can behold on thee
Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests
He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
By thee created and by thee threw down
The aspiring Dominations  Thou that day
Thy Fathers dreadful thunder didst not spare
Nor stop thy flaming chariotwheels that shook
Heavens everlasting frame while oer the necks
Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim
Thee only extolled Son of thy Fathers might
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes
Not so on Man  Him through their malice fallen
Father of mercy and grace thou didst not doom
So strictly but much more to pity incline
No sooner did thy dear and only Son
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
So strictly but much more to pity inclined
He to appease thy wrath and end the strife
Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned
Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
Second to thee offered himself to die
For Mans offence  O unexampled love
Love no where to be found less than Divine
Hail Son of God Saviour of Men  Thy name
