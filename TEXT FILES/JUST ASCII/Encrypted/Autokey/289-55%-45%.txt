Of Hell resounded"Princes Potentates
Warriors the Flower of Heavenonce yours now lost
If such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal Spirits Or have ye chosen this place
After the toil of battle to repose
Your wearied virtue for the ease you find
To slumber here as in the vales of Heaven?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conqueror who now beholds
Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood
With scattered arms and ensigns till anon
His swift pursuers from Heavengates discern
Th advantage and descending tread us down
Thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts
Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?
Awake arise or be for ever fallen"
  They heard and were abashed and up they sprung
Upon the wing as when men wont to watch
On duty sleeping found by whom they dread
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight
In which they were or the fierce pains not feel
Yet to their Generals voice they soon obeyed
Innumerable As when the potent rod
Of Amrams son in Egypts evil day
Waved round the coast upcalled a pitchy cloud
Of locusts warping on the eastern wind
That oer the realm of impious Pharaoh hung
Like Night and darkened all the land of Nile
So numberless were those bad Angels seen
Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell
Twixt upper nether and surrounding fires
Till as a signal given th uplifted spear
Of their great Sultan waving to direct
Their course in even balance down they light
On the firm brimstone and fill all the plain
A multitude like which the populous North
Poured never from her frozen loins to pass
Rhene or the Danaw when her barbarous sons
Came like a deluge on the South and spread
Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands
Forthwith form every squadron and each band
The heads and leaders thither haste where stood
Their great Commandergodlike Shapes and Forms
Excelling human princely Dignities
And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones
Though on their names in Heavenly records now
Be no memorial blotted out and rased
By their rebellion from the Books of Life
Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve
Got them new names till wandering oer the earth
Through Gods high sufferance for the trial of man
By falsities and lies the greatest part
Of mankind they corrupted to forsake
God their Creator and th invisible
Glory of him that made them to transform
Oft to the image of a brute adorned
With gay religions full of pomp and gold
And devils to adore for deities
Then were they known to men by various names
And various idols through the heathen world
  Say Muse their names then known who first who last
Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch
At their great Emperors call as next in worth
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand
While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?
  The chief were those who from the pit of Hell
Roaming to seek their prey on Earth durst fix
Their seats long after next the seat of God
Their altars by his altar gods adored
Among the nations round and durst abide
Jehovah thundering out of Sion throned
Between the Cherubim yea often placed
Within his sanctuary itself their shrines
Abominations and with cursed things
His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned
And with their darkness durst affront his light
First Moloch horrid king besmeared with blood
Of human sacrifice and parents tears
Though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud
Their childrens cries unheard that passed through fire
To his grim idol Him the Ammonite
Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain
In Argob and in Basan to the stream
Of utmost Arnon Nor content with such
Audacious neighbourhood the wisest heart
Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build
His temple right against the temple of God
On that opprobrious hill and made his grove
The pleasant valley of Hinnom Tophet thence
And black Gehenna called the type of Hell
Next Chemos th obscene dread of Moabs sons
From Aroar to Nebo and the wild
Of southmost Abarim in Hesebon
And Horonaim Seons real beyond
The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines
And Eleale to th Asphaltic Pool
Peor his other name when he enticed
Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile
To do him wanton rites which cost them woe
Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged
Even to that hill of scandal by the grove
Of Moloch homicide lust hard by hate
Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell
With these came they who from the bordering flood
Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts
Egypt from Syrian ground had general names
Of Baalim and Ashtaroththose male
These feminine For Spirits when they please
Can either sex assume or both so soft
And uncompounded is their essence pure
Not tried or manacled with joint or limb
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones
Like cumbrous flesh but in what shape they choose
Dilated or condensed bright or obscure
Can execute their airy GUZGMHYJ
