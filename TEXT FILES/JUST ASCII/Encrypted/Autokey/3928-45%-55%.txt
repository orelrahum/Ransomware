Bosnia and Herzegovina Economy

Overview
    Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest component in
    the old Yugoslav federation Although agriculture has been almost all in
    private hands farms have been small and inefficient and the republic
    traditionally has been a net importer of food Industry has been greatly
    overstaffed one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning
    and management Tito had pushed the development of military industries in
    the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of
    Yugoslavias defense plants As of April  the newly independent
    republic was being torn apart by bitter interethnic warfare that has caused
    production to plummet unemployment and inflation to soar and human misery
    to multiply The survival of the republic as a political and economic unit
    is in doubt Both Serbia and Croatia have imposed various economic blockades
    and may permanently take over large areas populated by fellow ethnic groups
    These areas contain most of the industry If a much smaller core Muslim
    state survives it will share many Third World problems of poverty
    technological backwardness and dependence on historiUTZCG UOQE DGFJBLB
