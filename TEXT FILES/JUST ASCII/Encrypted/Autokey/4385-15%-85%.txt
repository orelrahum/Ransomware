Saint Pierre and Miquelon Economy

Overview
    The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by
    servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of Newfoundland The
    economy has been declining however because the number of ships stopping at
    Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years In March  an
    agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pierres
    trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadianclaimed waters for three years
    The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish
    exports to a halt The islands are heavily subsidized by France Imports
    come primarily from Canada and France
