United States Economy

Overview
    The US has the most powerful diverse and technologically advanced economy
    in the world with a per capita GDP of  the largest among major
    industrial nations The economy is market oriented with most decisions made
    by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of
    goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace In  the
    economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth the
    longest in peacetime history The expansion featured moderation in wage and
    consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to  of
    the labor force In  however growth slowed to  because of a
    combination of factors such as the worldwide increase in interest rates
    Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in August the subsequent spurt in oil prices and
    a general decline in business and consumer confidence In  output failed
    to recover unemployment grew and signs of recovery proved premature
    Ongoing problems for the s include inadequate investment in economic
    infrastructure rapidly rising medical costs and sizable budget and trade
    deficits

Uruguay Economy

Overview
    The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession of the early s
    In  real GDP grew by only  and in  by  The recovery was led
    by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors agriculture alone
    contributing  to GDP employing about  of the labor force and
    generating a large proportion of export earnings Raising livestock
    particularly cattle and sheep is the major agricultural activity In 
    domestic growth improved somewhat over  but various government factors
    including concentration on the external sector adverse weather conditions
    and greater attention to bringing down inflation and reducing the fiscal
    deficit kept output from expanding rapidly In a major step toward greater
    regional economic cooperation Uruguay joined Brazil Argentina and
    Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market Mercosur President
    LACALLE continues to press ahead with a broad economic reform plan to reduce
    state intervention in the economy but he faces strong opposition
