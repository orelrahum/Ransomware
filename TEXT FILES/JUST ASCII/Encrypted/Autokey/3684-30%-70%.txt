Israel Economy

Overview
    Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation It
    depends on imports of crude oil grains raw materials and military
    equipment Despite limited natural resources Israel has intensively
    developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past  years
    Industry employs about  of Israeli workers agriculture  and services
    most of the rest Diamonds hightechnology equipment and agricultural
    products fruits and vegetables are leading exports Israel usually posts
    balanceofpayments deficits which are covered by large transfer payments
    from abroad and by foreign loans Roughly half of the governments 
    billion external debt is owed to the United States which is its major
    source of economic and military aid To earn needed foreign exchange Israel
    has been targeting hightechnology niches in international markets such as
    medical scanning equipment Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in August  dealt a
    blow to Israels economy Higher world oil prices added an estimated 
    million to the oil import bill that year and helped keep annual inflation at
     Regional tension and the continuing Palestinian uprising intifadah
    have contributed to a sharp drop in tourism  a key foreign exchange earner
     to the lowest level since the  ArabIsraeli war The influx of Jewish
    immigrants from the former USSR which topped  during the period
     will increase unemployment intensify housing problems widen the
    government budget deficit and fuel inflation

Italy Economy

Overview
    Since World War II the economy has changed from one based on agriculture
    into a ranking industrial economy with approximately the same total and per
    capita output as France and the UK The country is still divided into a
    developed industrial north dominated by small private companies and an
    undeveloped agricultural south dominated by large public enterprises
    Services account for  of GDP industry about  agriculture  and
    public administration  Most raw materials needed by industry and over
     of energy requirements must be imported After growing at an annual
    average rate of  during the period  growth slowed to about  in
     For the s Italy faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering
    communications system curbing pollution in major industrial centers and
    adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic
    integration of the European Community
