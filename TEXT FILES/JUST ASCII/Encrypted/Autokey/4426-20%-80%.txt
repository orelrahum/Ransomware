everybody knows people will be networking information why go to the
troublewhich is far greater with CDROM than with the production of
magnetic data?  Finally how does one make the data available?  Can many
of the hurdles to using electronic information that some publishers have
imposed upon databases be eliminated?

The PLD project was based on the principle that computersearching of
texts is most effective when it is done with a large database  Because
PLD represented a collection that serves so many disciplines across so
many periods it was irresistible

The basic rule in converting PLD was to do no harm to avoid the sins of
intrusion in such a database  no introduction of newer editions no
onthespot changes no eradicating of all possible falsehoods from an
edition  Thus PLD is not the final act in electronic publishing for
this discipline but simply the beginning  The conversion of PLD has
evoked numerous unanticipated questions  How will information be used?
What about networking?  Can the rights of a database be protected?
Should one protect the rights of a database?  How can it be made
available?

Those converting PLD also tried to avoid the sins of omission that is
excluding portions of the collections or whole sections  What about the
images?  PLD is full of images some are extremely pious
nineteenthcentury representations of the Fathers while others contain
highly interesting elements  The goal was to cover all the text of Migne
including notes in Greek and in Hebrew the latter of which in
particular causes problems in creating a search structure all the
indices and even the images which are being scanned in separately
searchable files

Several North American institutions that have placed acquisition requests
for the PLD database have requested it in magnetic form without software
which means they are already running it without software without
anything demonstrated at the Workshop

What cannot practically be done is go back and reconvert and reencode
data a timeconsuming and extremely costly enterprise  CALALUCA sees
PLD as a database that can and should be run under a variety of
retrieval softwares  This will permit the widest possible searches
Consequently the need to produce a CDROM of PLD as well as to develop
software that could handle some  gigabyte of heavily encoded text
developed out of conversations with collection development and reference
librarians who wanted software both compassionate enough for the
pedestrian but also capable of incorporating the most detailed
lexicographical studies that a user desires to conduct  In the end the
encoding and conversion of the data will prove the most enduring
testament to the value of the project

The encoding of the database was also a hardfought issue  Did the
database need to be encoded? Were there normative structures for encoding
humanist texts?  Should it be SGML?  What about the TEIwill it last
will it prove useful?  CALALUCA expressed some minor doubts as to whether
a data bank can be fully TEIconformant  Every effort can be made but
in the end to be TEIconformant means to accept the need to make some
firm encoding decisions that can indeed be disputed  The TEI points
the publisher in a proper direction but does not presume to make all the
decisions for him or her  Essentially the goal of encoding was to
eliminate as much as possible the hindrances to informationnetworking
so that if an institution acquires a database everybody associated with
the institution can have access to it

CALALUCA demonstrated a portion of Volume  because it had the most
anomalies in it  The software was created by Electronic Book
Technologies of Providence RI and is called Dynatext  The software
works only with SGMLcoded data

Viewing a table of contents on the screen the audience saw how Dynatext
treats each element as a book and attempts to simplify movement through a
volume  Familiarity with the Patrologia in print ie the text its
source and the editions will make the machinereadable versions highly
useful  Software with a Windows application was sought for PLD
CALALUCA said because this was the main trend for scholarly use

CALALUCA also demonstrated how a user can perform a variety of searches
and quickly move to any part of a volume the lookup screen provides
some basic simple wordsearching

CALALUCA argued that one of the major difficulties is not the software
Rather in creating a product that will be used by scholars representing
a broad spectrum of computer sophistication  user documentation proves
to be the most important service one can provide

CALALUCA next illustrated a truncated search under mysterium within ten
words of virtus and how one would be able to find its contents throughout
the entire database  He said that the exciting thing about PLD is that
many of the applications in the retrieval software being written for it
will exceed the capabilities of the software employed now for the CDROM
version  The CDROM faces genuine limitations in terms of speed and
comprehensiveness in the creation of a retrieval software to run it
CALALUCA said he hoped that individual scholars will download the data
if they wish to their personal computers and have ready access to
important texts on a constant basis which they will be able to use in
their research and from which they might even be able to publish

CALALUCA explained that the blue numbers represented Mignes column numbers
which are the standard scholarly references  Pulling up a note he stated
that these texts were heavily edited and the image files would appear simply
as a note as well so that one could quickly access an image

                                 


FLEISCHHAUERERWAY  Several problems with which AM is still wrestling 
Various search and retrieval capabilities  Illustration of automatic
stemming and a truncated search  AMs attempt to find ways to connect
cataloging to the texts  AMs gravitation towards SGML  Striking a
balance between quantity and quality  How AM furnishes users recourse to
images  Conducting a search in a fulltext environment  Macintosh and
IBM prototypes of AM  Multimedia aspects of AM 


A demonstration of American Memory by its coordinator Carl FLEISCHHAUER
and Ricky ERWAY associate coordinator Library of Congress concluded
the morning session  Beginning with a collection of broadsides from the
Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention the only text
collection in a presentable form at the time of the Workshop FLEISCHHAUER
highlighted several of the problems with which AM is still wrestling
In its final form the disk will contain two collections not only the
broadsides but also the full text with illustrations of a set of
approximately  AfricanAmerican pamphlets from the period  to 

As FREEMAN had explained earlier AM has attempted to use a small amount
of interpretation to introduce collections  In the present case the
contractor a company named Quick Source in Silver Spring MD used
software called Toolbook and put together a modestly interactive
introduction to the collection  Like the two preceding speakers
FLEISCHHAUER argued that the real asset was the underlying collection

FLEISCHHAUER proceeded to describe various search and retrieval
capabilities while ERWAY worked the computer  In this particular package
the "go to" pulldown allowed the user in effect to jump out of Toolbook
where the interactive program was located and enter the thirdparty
software used by AM for this text collection which is called Personal
Librarian  This was the Windows version of Personal Librarian a
software application put together by a company in Rockville Md

Since the broadsides came from the Revolutionary War period a search was
conducted using the words British or war with the default operator reset
as or  FLEISCHHAUER demonstrated both automatic stemming which finds
other forms of the same root and a truncated search  One of Personal
Librarians strongest features the relevance ranking was represented by
a chart that indicated how often words being sought appeared in
documents with the one receiving the most "hits" obtaining the highest
score  The "hit list" that is supplied takes the relevance ranking into
account making the first hit in effect the one the software has
selected as the most relevant example

While in the text of one of the broadside documents FLEISCHHAUER
remarked AMs attempt to find ways to connect cataloging to the texts
which it does in different ways in different manifestations  In the case
shown the cataloging was pasted on  AM took MARC records that were
written as online records right into one of the Librarys mainframe
retrieval programs pulled them out and handed them off to the contractor
who massaged them somewhat to display them in the manner shown  One of
AMs questions is Does the cataloguing normally performed in the mainframe
work in this context or had AM ought to think through adjustments?

FLEISCHHAUER made the additional point that as far as the text goes AM
has gravitated towards SGML he pointed to the boldface in the upper part
of the screen  Although extremely limited in its ability to translate
or interpret SGML Personal Librarian will furnish both bold and italics
on screen a fairly easy thing to do but it is one of the ways in which
SGML is useful

Striking a balance between quantity and quality has been a major concern
of AM with accuracy being one of the places where project staff have
felt that less than percent accuracy was not unacceptable
FLEISCHHAUER cited the example of the standard of the rekeying industry
namely  percent as one service bureau informed him to go from
 to  percent would double the cost

FLEISCHHAUER next demonstrated how AM furnishes users recourse to images
and at the same time recalled LESKs pointed question concerning the
number of people who would look at those images and the number who would
work only with the text  If the implication of LESKs question was
sound FLEISCHHAUER said it raised the stakes for text accuracy and
reduced the value of the strategy for images

Contending that preservation is always a bugaboo FLEISCHHAUER
demonstrated several images derived from a scan of a preservation
microfilm that AM had made  He awarded a grade of C at best perhaps a
C minus or a C plus for how well it worked out  Indeed the matter of
learning if other people had better ideas about scanning in general and
in particular scanning from microfilm was one of the factors that drove
AM to attempt to think through the agenda for the Workshop  Skew for
example was one of the issues that AM in its ignorance had not reckoned
would prove so difficult

Further the handling of images of the sort shown in a desktop computer
environment involved a considerable amount of zooming and scrolling
Ultimately AM staff feel that perhaps the paper copy that is printed out
might be the most useful one but they remain uncertain as to how much
onscreen reading users will do

Returning to the text FLEISCHHAUER asked viewers to imagine a person who
might be conducting a search in a fulltext environment  With this
scenario he proceeded to illustrate other features of Personal Librarian
that he considered helpful for example it provides the ability to
notice words as one reads  Clicking the "include" button on the bottom
of the search window pops the words that have been highlighted into the
search  Thus a user can refine the search as he or she reads
reexecuting the search and continuing to find things in the quest for
materials  This software not only contains relevance ranking Boolean
operators and truncation it also permits one to perform word algebra
so to say where one puts two or three words in parentheses and links
them with one Boolean operator and then a couple of words in another set
of parentheses and asks for things within so many words of others

Until they became acquainted recently with some of the work being done in
classics the AM staff had not realized that a large number of the
projects that involve electronic texts were being done by people with a
profound interest in language and linguistics  Their search strategies
and thinking are oriented to those fields as is shown in particular by
the Perseus example  As amateur historians the AM staff were thinking
more of searching for concepts and ideas than for particular words
Obviously FLEISCHHAUER conceded searching for concepts and ideas and
searching for words may be two rather closely related things

While displaying several images FLEISCHHAUER observed that the Macintosh
prototype built by AM contains a greater diversity of formats  Echoing a
previous speaker he said that it was easier to stitch things together in
the Macintosh though it tended to be a little more anemic in search and
retrieval  AM therefore increasingly has been investigating
sophisticated retrieval engines in the IBM format

FLEISCHHAUER demonstrated several additional examples of the prototype
interfaces  One was AMs metaphor for the network future in which a
kind of readingroom graphic suggests how one would be able to go around
to different materials  AM contains a large number of photographs in
analog video form worked up from a videodisc which enable users to make
copies to print or incorporate in digital documents  A framegrabber is
built into the system making it possible to bring an image into a window
and digitize or print it out

FLEISCHHAUER next demonstrated sound recording which included texts
Recycled from a previous project the collection included sixty rpm
phonograph records of political speeches that were made during and
immediately after World War I  These constituted approximately three
hours of audio as AM has digitized it which occupy  megabytes on a
CD  Thus they are considerably compressed  From the catalogue card
FLEISCHHAUER proceeded to a transcript of a speech with the audio
available and with highlighted text following it as it played
A photograph has been added and a transcription made

Considerable value has been added beyond what the Library of Congress
normally would do in cataloguing a sound recording which raises several
questions for AM concerning where to draw lines about how much value it can
afford to add and at what point perhaps this becomes more than AM could
reasonably do or reasonably wish to do  FLEISCHHAUER also demonstrated
a motion picture  As FREEMAN had reported earlier the motion picture
materials have proved the most popular not surprisingly  This says more
about the medium he thought than about AMs presentation of it

Because AMs goal was to bring together things that could be used by
historians or by people who were curious about history
turnofthecentury footage seemed to represent the most appropriate
collections from the Library of Congress in motion pictures These were
the very first films made by Thomas Edisons company and some others at
that time  The particular example illustrated was a Biograph film
brought in with a framegrabber into a window  A single videodisc
contains about fifty titles and pieces of film from that period all of
New York City  Taken together AM believes they provide an interesting
documentary resource

                                 


DISCUSSION  Using the framegrabber in AM  Volume of material processed
and to be processed  Purpose of AM within LC  Cataloguing and the
nature of AMs material  SGML coding and the question of quality versus
quantity 


During the questionandanswer period that followed FLEISCHHAUERs
presentation several clarifications were made

AM is bringing in motion pictures from a videodisc  The framegrabber
devices create a window on a computer screen which permits users to
digitize a single frame of the movie or one of the photographs  It
produces a crude roughandready image that high school students can
incorporate into papers and that has worked very nicely in this way

Commenting on FLEISCHHAUERs assertion that AM was looking more at
searching ideas than words MYLONAS argued that without words an idea
does not exist  FLEISCHHAUER conceded that he ought to have articulated
his point more clearly  MYLONAS stated that they were in fact both
talking about the same thing  By searching for words and by forcing
people to focus on the word the Perseus Project felt that they would get
them to the idea  The way one reviews results is tailored more to one
kind of user than another

Concerning the total volume of material that has been processed in this
way AM at this point has in retrievable form seven or eight collections
all of them photographic  In the Macintosh environment for example
there probably are  photographs  The sound recordings
number sixty items  The broadsides number about  items  There are
 political cartoons in the form of drawings  The motion pictures as
individual items number sixty to seventy

AM also has a manuscript collection the life history portion of one of
the federal project series which will contain  individual
documents all firstperson narratives  AM has in process about 
AfricanAmerican pamphlets or about  printed pages for the period
  Also in the works are some  panoramic photographs  AM
has recycled a fair amount of the work done by LCs Prints and
Photographs Division during the Librarys optical disk pilot project in
the s  For example a special division of LC has tooled up and
thought through all the ramifications of electronic presentation of
photographs  Indeed they are wheeling them out in great barrel loads
The purpose of AM within the Library it is hoped is to catalyze several
of the other special collection divisions which have no particular
experience with in some cases mixed feelings about an activity such as
AM  Moreover in many cases the divisions may be characterized as not
only lacking experience in "electronifying" things but also in automated
cataloguing  MARC cataloguing as practiced in the United States is
heavily weighted toward the description of monograph and serial
materials but is much thinner when one enters the world of manuscripts
and things that are held in the Librarys music collection and other
units  In response to a comment by LESK that AMs material is very
heavily photographic and is so primarily because individual records have
been made for each photograph FLEISCHHAUER observed that an itemlevel
catalog record exists for example for each photograph in the Detroit
Publishing collection of  pictures  In the case of the Federal
Writers Project for which nearly  documents exist representing
information from twentysix different states AM with the assistance of
Karen STUART of the Manuscript Division will attempt to find some way not
only to have a collectionlevel record but perhaps a MARC record for each
state which will then serve as an umbrella for the  documents
that come under it  But that drama remains to be enacted  The AM staff
is conservative and clings to cataloguing though of course visitors tout
artificial intelligence and neural networks in a manner that suggests that
perhaps one need not have cataloguing or that much of it could be put aside

The matter of SGML coding FLEISCHHAUER conceded returned the discussion
to the earlier treated question of quality versus quantity in the Library
of Congress  Of course text conversion can be done with percent
accuracy but it means that when ones holdings are as vast as LCs only
a tiny amount will be exposed whereas permitting lower levels of
accuracy can lead to exposing or sharing larger amounts but with the
quality correspondingly impaired

                                 


TWOHIG  A contrary experience concerning electronic options  Volume of
material in the Washington papers and a suggestion of David Packard 
Implications of Packards suggestion  Transcribing the documents for the
CDROM  Accuracy of transcriptions  The CDROM edition of the Founding
Fathers documents 


Finding encouragement in a comment of MICHELSONs from the morning
sessionthat numerous people in the humanities were choosing electronic
options to do their workDorothy TWOHIG editor The Papers of George
Washington opened her illustrated talk by noting that her experience
with literary scholars and numerous people in editing was contrary to
MICHELSONs  TWOHIG emphasized literary scholars complete ignorance of
the technological options available to them or their reluctance or in
some cases their downright hostility toward these options

After providing an overview of the five Founding Fathers projects
Jefferson at Princeton Franklin at Yale John Adams at the
Massachusetts Historical Society and Madison down the hall from her at
the University of Virginia TWOHIG observed that the Washington papers
like all of the projects include both sides of the Washington
correspondence and deal with some  documents to be published with
extensive annotation in eighty to eightyfive volumes a project that
will not be completed until well into the next century  Thus it was
with considerable enthusiasm several years ago that the Washington Papers
Project WPP greeted David Packards suggestion that the papers of the
Founding Fathers could be published easily and inexpensively and to the
great benefit of American scholarship via CDROM

In pragmatic terms funding from the Packard Foundation would expedite
the transcription of thousands of documents waiting to be put on disk in
the WPP offices  Further since the costs of collecting editing and
converting the Founding Fathers documents into letterpress editions were
running into the millions of dollars and the considerable staffs
involved in all of these projects were devoting their careers to
producing the work the Packard Foundations suggestion had a
revolutionary aspect  Transcriptions of the entire corpus of the
Founding Fathers papers would be available on CDROM to public and
college libraries even high schools at a fraction of the cost
 for the annual license feeto produce a limited university
press run of  of each volume of the published papers at  per
printed volume  Given the current budget crunch in educational systems
and the corresponding constraints on librarians in smaller institutions
who wish to add these volumes to their collections producing the
documents on CDROM would likely open a greatly expanded audience for the
papers  TWOHIG stressed however that development of the Founding
Fathers CDROM is still in its infancy  Serious software problems remain
to be resolved before the material can be put into readable form

Funding from the Packard Foundation resulted in a major push to
transcribe the  or so documents of the Washington papers remaining
to be transcribed onto computer disks  Slides illustrated several of the
problems encountered for example the present inability of CDROM to
