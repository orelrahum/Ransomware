CELIA	Something browner than Judass marry his kisses are
	Judass own children

ROSALIND	I faith his hair is of a good colour

CELIA	An excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour

ROSALIND	And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
	of holy bread

CELIA	He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana a nun
	of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously
	the very ice of chastity is in them

ROSALIND	But why did he swear he would come this morning and
	comes not?

CELIA	Nay certainly there is no truth in him

ROSALIND	Do you think so?

CELIA	Yes I think he is not a pickpurse nor a
	horsestealer but for his verity in love I do
	think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
	wormeaten nut

ROSALIND	Not true in love?

CELIA	Yes when he is in but I think he is not in

ROSALIND	You have heard him swear downright he was

CELIA	Was is not is besides the oath of a lover is
	no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
	both the confirmer of false reckonings He attends
	here in the forest on the duke your father

ROSALIND	I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
	him he asked me of what parentage I was I told
	him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go
	But what talk we of fathers when there is such a
	man as Orlando?

CELIA	O thats a brave man he writes brave verses
	speaks brave words swears brave oaths and breaks
	them bravely quite traverse athwart the heart of
	his lover as a puisny tilter that spurs his horse
	but on one side breaks his staff like a noble
	goose but alls brave that youth mounts and folly
	guides Who comes here?

	Enter CORIN

CORIN	Mistress and master you have oft inquired
	After the shepherd that complaind of love
	Who you saw sitting by me on the turf
	Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
	That was his mistress

CELIA	Well and what of him?

CORIN	If you will see a pageant truly playd
	Between the pale complexion of true love
	And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain
	Go hence a little and I shall conduct you
	If you will mark it

ROSALIND	O come let us remove
	The sight of lovers feedeth those in love
	Bring us to this sight and you shall say
	Ill prove a busy actor in their play

	Exeunt

ACT III



SCENE V	Another part of the forest


	Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe do not scorn me do not Phebe
	Say that you love me not but say not so
	In bitterness The common executioner
	Whose heart the accustomd sight of death makes hard
	Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
	But first begs pardon will you sterner be
	Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?

	Enter ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN behind

PHEBE	I would not be thy executioner
	I fly thee for I would not injure thee
	Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye
	Tis pretty sure and very probable
	That eyes that are the frailst and softest things
	Who shut their coward gates on atomies
	Should be calld tyrants butchers murderers
	Now I do frown on thee with all my heart
	And if mine eyes can wound now let them kill thee
	Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
	Or if thou canst not O for shame for shame
	Lie not to say mine eyes are murderers
	Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee
	Scratch thee but with a pin and there remains
	Some scar of it lean but upon a rush
	The cicatrice and capable impressure
	Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes
	Which I have darted at thee hurt thee not
	Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes
	That can do hurt

SILVIUS	                  O dear Phebe
	If everas that ever may be near
	You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy
	Then shall you know the wounds invisible
	That loves keen arrows make

PHEBE	But till that time
	Come not thou near me and when that time comes
	Afflict me with thy mocks pity me not
	As till that time I shall not pity thee

ROSALIND	And why I pray you? Who might be your mother
	That you insult exult and all at once
	Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty
	As by my faith I see no more in you
	Than without candle may go dark to bed
	Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
	Why what means this? Why do you look on me?
	I see no more in you than in the ordinary
	Of natures salework Ods my little life
	I think she means to tangle my eyes too
	No faith proud mistress hope not after it
	Tis not your inky brows your black silk hair
	Your bugle eyeballs nor your cheek of cream
	That can entame my spirits to your worship
	You foolish shepherd wherefore do you follow her
	Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
	You are a thousand times a properer man
	Than she a woman tis such fools as you
	That makes the world full of illfavourd children
	Tis not her glass but you that flatters her
	And out of you she sees herself more proper
	Than any of her lineaments can show her
	But mistress know yourself down on your knees
	And thank heaven fasting for a good mans love
	For I must tell you friendly in your ear
	Sell when you can you are not for all markets
	Cry the man mercy love him take his offer
	Foul is most foul being foul to be a scoffer
	So take her to thee shepherd fare you well

PHEBE	Sweet youth I pray you chide a year together
	I had rather hear you chide than this man woo

ROSALIND	Hes fallen in love with your foulness and shell
	fall in love with my anger If it be so as fast as
	she answers thee with frowning looks Ill sauce her
	with bitter words Why look you so upon me?

PHEBE	For no ill will I bear you

ROSALIND	I pray you do not fall in love with me
	For I am falser than vows made in wine
	Besides I like you not If you will know my house
	Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
	Will you go sister? Shepherd ply her hard
	Come sister Shepherdess look on him better
	And be not proud though all the world could see
	None could be so abused in sight as he
	Come to our flock

	Exeunt ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN

PHEBE	Dead Shepherd now I find thy saw of might
	Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe

PHEBE	                  Ha what sayst thou Silvius?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe pity me

PHEBE	Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius

SILVIUS	Wherever sorrow is relief would be
	If you do sorrow at my grief in love
	By giving love your sorrow and my grief
	Were both extermined

PHEBE	Thou hast my love is not that neighbourly?

SILVIUS	I would have you

PHEBE	                  Why that were covetousness
	Silvius the time was that I hated thee
	And yet it is not that I bear thee love
	But since that thou canst talk of love so well
	Thy company which erst was irksome to me
	I will endure and Ill employ thee too
	But do not look for further recompense
	Than thine own gladness that thou art employd

SILVIUS	So holy and so perfect is my love
	And I in such a poverty of grace
	That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
	To glean the broken ears after the man
	That the main harvest reaps loose now and then
	A scatterd smile and that Ill live upon

PHEBE	Knowst now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

SILVIUS	Not very well but I have met him oft
	And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
	That the old carlot once was master of

PHEBE	Think not I love him though I ask for him
	Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
	But what care I for words? yet words do well
	When he that speaks them pleases those that hear
	It is a pretty youth not very pretty
	But sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him
	Hell make a proper man the best thing in him
	Is his complexion and faster than his tongue
	Did make offence his eye did heal it up
	He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall
	His leg is but so so and yet tis well
	There was a pretty redness in his lip
	A little riper and more lusty red
	Than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference
	Between the constant red and mingled damask
	There be some women Silvius had they markd him
	In parcels as I did would have gone near
	To fall in love with him but for my part
	I love him not nor hate him not and yet
	I have more cause to hate him than to love him
	For what had he to do to chide at me?
	He said mine eyes were black and my hair black
	And now I am rememberd scornd at me
	I marvel why I answerd not again
	But thats all one omittance is no quittance
	Ill write to him a very taunting letter
	And thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius?

SILVIUS	Phebe with all my heart

PHEBE	Ill write it straight
	The matters in my head and in my heart
	I will be bitter with him and passing short
	Go with me Silvius

	Exeunt

ACT IV



SCENE I	The forest


	Enter ROSALIND CELIA and JAQUES

JAQUES	I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted
	with thee

ROSALIND	They say you are a melancholy fellow

JAQUES	I am so I do love it better than laughing

ROSALIND	Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
	fellows and betray themselves to every modern
	censure worse than drunkards

JAQUES	Why tis good to be sad and say nothing

ROSALIND	Why then tis good to be a post

JAQUES	I have neither the scholars melancholy which is
	emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical
	nor the courtiers which is proud nor the
	soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers
	which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor
	the lovers which is all these but it is a
	melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples
	extracted from many objects and indeed the sundrys
	contemplation of my travels in which my often
	rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness

ROSALIND	A traveller By my faith you have great reason to
	be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see
	other mens then to have seen much and to have
	nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands

JAQUES	Yes I have gained my experience

ROSALIND	And your experience makes you sad I had rather have
	a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
	sad and to travel for it too

	Enter ORLANDO

ORLANDO	Good day and happiness dear Rosalind

JAQUES	Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse

	Exit

ROSALIND	Farewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and
	wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your
	own country be out of love with your nativity and
	almost chide God for making you that countenance you
	are or I will scarce think you have swam in a
	gondola Why how now Orlando where have you been
	all this while? You a lover An you serve me such
	another trick never come in my sight more

ORLANDO	My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise

ROSALIND	Break an hours promise in love He that will
	divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
	a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
	affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid
	hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant
	him heartwhole

ORLANDO	Pardon me dear Rosalind

ROSALIND	Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I
	had as lief be wooed of a snail

ORLANDO	Of a snail?

ROSALIND	Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he
	carries his house on his head a better jointure
	I think than you make a woman besides he brings
	his destiny with him

ORLANDO	Whats that?

ROSALIND	Why horns which such as you are fain to be
	beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in
	his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife

ORLANDO	Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous

ROSALIND	And I am your Rosalind

CELIA	It pleases him to call you so but he hath a
	Rosalind of a better leer than you

ROSALIND	Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday
	humour and like enough to consent What would you
	say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I would kiss before I spoke

ROSALIND	Nay you were better speak first and when you were
	gravelled for lack of matter you might take
	occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are
	out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod
	warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss

ORLANDO	How if the kiss be denied?

ROSALIND	Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter

ORLANDO	Who could be out being before his beloved mistress?

ROSALIND	Marry that should you if I were your mistress or
	I should think my honesty ranker than my wit

ORLANDO	What of my suit?

ROSALIND	Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
	Am not I your Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I take some joy to say you are because I would be
	talking of her

ROSALIND	Well in her person I say I will not have you

ORLANDO	Then in mine own person I die

ROSALIND	No faith die by attorney The poor world is
	almost six thousand years old and in all this time
	there was not any man died in his own person
	videlicit in a lovecause Troilus had his brains
	dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he
	could to die before and he is one of the patterns
	of love Leander he would have lived many a fair
	year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been
	for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
	but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
	taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
	coroners of that age found it was Hero of Sestos
	But these are all lies men have died from time to
	time and worms have eaten them but not for love

ORLANDO	I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind
	for I protest her frown might kill me

ROSALIND	By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now
	I will be your Rosalind in a more comingon
	disposition and ask me what you will I will grant
	it

ORLANDO	Then love me Rosalind

ROSALIND	Yes faith will I Fridays and Saturdays and all

ORLANDO	And wilt thou have me?

ROSALIND	Ay and twenty such

ORLANDO	What sayest thou?

ROSALIND	Are you not good?

ORLANDO	I hope so

ROSALIND	Why then can one desire too much of a good thing?
	Come sister you shall be the priest and marry us
	Give me your hand Orlando What do you say sister?

ORLANDO	Pray thee marry us

CELIA	I cannot say the words

ROSALIND	You must begin Will you Orlando

CELIA	Go to Will you Orlando have to wife this Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I will

ROSALIND	Ay but when?

ORLANDO	Why now as fast as she can marry us

ROSALIND	Then you must say I take thee Rosalind for wife

ORLANDO	I take thee Rosalind for wife

ROSALIND	I might ask you for your commission but I do take
	thee Orlando for my husband theres a girl goes
	before the priest and certainly a womans thought
	runs before her actions

ORLANDO	So do all thoughts they are winged

ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her after you
	have possessed her

ORLANDO	For ever and a day

ROSALIND	Say a day without the ever No no Orlando
	men are April when they woo December when they wed
	maids are May when they are maids but the sky
	changes when they are wives I will be more jealous
	of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen
	more clamorous than a parrot against rain more
	newfangled than an ape more giddy in my desires
	than a monkey I will weep for nothing like Diana
	in the fountain and I will do that when you are
	disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyen and
	that when thou art inclined to sleep

ORLANDO	But will my Rosalind do so?

ROSALIND	By my life she will do as I do

ORLANDO	O but she is wise

ROSALIND	Or else she could not have the wit to do this the
	wiser the waywarder make the doors upon a womans
	wit and it will out at HBX CTLLQGNL WTYG MZHN TGK
