Ecuador Economy

Overview
    Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas Growth
    has been uneven because of natural disasters for example a major
    earthquake in  fluctuations in global oil prices and government
    policies designed to curb inflation The government has not taken a
    supportive attitude toward either domestic or foreign investment although
    its agreement to enter the Andean free trade zone is an encouraging move As
     ended Ecuador received a standby IMF loan of  million which will
    permit the country to proceed with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt

Egypt Economy

Overview
    Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
    economies most industrial plants being owned by the government
    Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment
    Even so the economy grew rapidly during the late s and early s but
    in  the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
    debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
    balanceofpayments support As part of the  agreement with the IMF the
    government agreed to institute a reform program to reduce inflation promote
    economic growth and improve its external position The reforms have been
    slow in coming however and the economy has been largely stagnant for the
    past four years The addition of  million people every seven months to
    Egypts population exerts enormous pressure on the  of the total land area
    available for agriculture
