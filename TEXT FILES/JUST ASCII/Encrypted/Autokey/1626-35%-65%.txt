Yemen Economy

Overview
    Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united Yemen
    the southern city Aden with its refinery and port facilities is the
    economic and commercial capital Future economic development depends heavily
    on Westernassisted development of promising oil resources South Yemens
    willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet
    economic support
Overview
  North
    The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen
    dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential needs Large trade
    deficits have been made up for by remittances from Yemenis working abroad
    and foreign aid Once selfsufficient in food production northern Yemen has
    become a major importer Land once used for export crops  cotton fruit
    and vegetables  has been turned over to growing qat a mildly narcotic
    shrub chewed by Yemenis which has no significant export market Oil export
    revenues started flowing in late  and boosted  earnings by about
     million
  South
    This has been one of the poorest Arab countries with a per capita GNP of
    about  A shortage of natural resources a widely dispersed population
    and an arid climate have made economic development difficult The economy
    has grown at an average annual rate of only  since the mids The
    economy had been organized along socialist lines dominated by the public
    sector Economic growth has been constrained by a lack of incentives partly
    stemming from centralized control over production decisions investment
    allocation and import choices
