Norway Economy

Overview
    Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free market activity
    and government intervention The government controls key areas such as the
    vital petroleum sector through largescale state enterprises and
    extensively subsidizes agricultural fishing and other sectors Norway also
    maintains an extensive welfare system that helps propel publicsector
    expenditures to slightly more than  of the GDP and results in one of the
    highest average tax burdens in the world  A small country with a high
    dependence on international trade Norway is basically an exporter of raw
    materials and semiprocessed goods with an abundance of small and
    mediumsized firms and is ranked among the major shipping nations The
    country is richly endowed with natural resources  petroleum hydropower
    fish forests and minerals  and is highly dependent on its oil sector to
    keep its economy afloat Although one of the governments main priorities is
    to reduce this dependency this situation is not likely to improve for years
    to come The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and
    diversify the economy through tax reform and an expansionary  budget
    Forecasters predict that economic growth will rise slightly in  because
    of publicsector expansion and moderate improvements in private investment
    and demand Inflation will remain about  while unemployment continues at
    record levels of over  because of the weakness of the economy outside the
    oil sector Oslo a member of the European Free Trade Area is continuing to
    deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the European
