Vietnam Economy

Overview
    This is a formerly centrally planned developing economy with extensive
    government ownership and control of productive facilities The economy is
    primarily agricultural the sector employs about  of the labor force and
    accounts for half of GNP Rice is the staple crop substantial amounts of
    maize sorghum cassava and sweet potatoes are also grown The government
    permits sale of surplus grain on the open market Most of the mineral
    resources are located in the north including coal which is an important
    export item Oil was discovered off the southern coast in  with
    production reaching  barrels per day in  and expected to increase
    in the years ahead Following the end of the war in  heavyhanded
    government measures undermined efforts at an efficient merger of the
    agricultural resources of the south and the industrial resources of the
    north The economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received
    assistance from UN agencies France Australia Sweden and Communist
    countries Inflation although down from recent tripledigit levels is
    still a major weakness and is showing signs of accelerating upwards again
    Per capita output is among the worlds lowest Since late  the
    government has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more
    economic activity over to the private sector
