Attends thee and each word each motion forms
Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth
Than of our fellowservant and inquire
Gladly into the ways of God with Man
For God we see hath honoured thee and set
On Man his equal love  Say therefore on
For I that day was absent as befel
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure
Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell
Squared in full legion such command we had
To see that none thence issued forth a spy
Or enemy while God was in his work
Lest he incensed at such eruption bold
Destruction with creation might have mixed
Not that they durst without his leave attempt
But us he sends upon his high behests
For state as Sovran King and to inure
Our prompt obedience  Fast we found fast shut
The dismal gates and barricadoed strong
But long ere our approaching heard within
Noise other than the sound of dance or song
Torment and loud lament and furious rage
Glad we returned up to the coasts of light
Ere sabbathevening so we had in charge
But thy relation now for I attend
Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine
So spake the Godlike Power and thus our Sire
For Man to tell how human life began
Is hard for who himself beginning knew
Desire with thee still longer to converse
Induced me  As new waked from soundest sleep
Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid
In balmy sweat which with his beams the sun
Soon dried and on the reeking moisture fed
Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned
And gazed a while the ample sky till raised
By quick instinctive motion up I sprung
As thitherward endeavouring and upright
Stood on my feet about me round I saw
Hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains
And liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these
Creatures that lived and moved and walked or flew
Birds on the branches warbling all things smiled
With fragrance and with joy my heart oerflowed
Myself I then perused and limb by limb
Surveyed and sometimes went and sometimes ran
With supple joints as lively vigour led
But who I was or where or from what cause
Knew not to speak I tried and forthwith spake
My tongue obeyed and readily could name
Whateer I saw  Thou Sun said I fair light
And thou enlightened Earth so fresh and gay
Ye Hills and Dales ye Rivers Woods and Plains
And ye that live and move fair Creatures tell
Tell if ye saw how I came thus how here?
Not of myselfby some great Maker then
In goodness and in power preeminent
Tell me how may I know him how adore
From whom I have that thus I move and live
And feel that I am happier than I know
While thus I called and strayed I knew not whither
From where I first drew air and first beheld
This happy light when answer none returned
On a green shady bank profuse of flowers
Pensive I sat me down  There gentle sleep
First found me and with soft oppression seised
My droused sense untroubled though I thought
I then was passing to my former state
Insensible and forthwith to dissolve
When suddenly stood at my head a dream
Whose inward apparition gently moved
My fancy to believe I yet had being
And lived  One came methought of shape divine
And said Thy mansion wants thee Adam rise
First Man of men innumerable ordained
First Father called by thee I come thy guide
To the garden of bliss thy seat prepared
So saying by the hand he took me raised
And over fields and waters as in air
Smoothsliding without step last led me up
A woody mountain whose high top was plain
A circuit wide enclosed with gooWSOSGW EZIWL
