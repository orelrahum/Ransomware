DUKE SENIOR	Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do

JAQUES	What for a counter would I do but good?

DUKE SENIOR	Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
	For thou thyself hast been a libertine
	As sensual as the brutish sting itself
	And all the embossed sores and headed evils
	That thou with licence of free foot hast caught
	Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world

JAQUES	Why who cries out on pride
	That can therein tax any private party?
	Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
	Till that the weary very means do ebb?
	What woman in the city do I name
	When that I say the citywoman bears
	The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
	Who can come in and say that I mean her
	When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
	Or what is he of basest function
	That says his bravery is not of my cost
	Thinking that I mean him but therein suits
	His folly to the mettle of my speech?
	There then how then? what then? Let me see wherein
	My tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right
	Then he hath wrongd himself if he be free
	Why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies
	Unclaimd of any man But who comes here?

	Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn

ORLANDO	Forbear and eat no more

JAQUES	Why I have eat none yet

ORLANDO	Nor shalt not till necessity be served

JAQUES	Of what kind should this cock come of?

DUKE SENIOR	Art thou thus boldend man by thy distress
	Or else a rude despiser of good manners
	That in civility thou seemst so empty?

ORLANDO	You touchd my vein at first the thorny point
	Of bare distress hath taen from me the show
	Of smooth civility yet am I inland bred
	And know some nurture But forbear I say
	He dies that touches any of this fruit
	Till I and my affairs are answered

JAQUES	An you will not be answered with reason I must die

DUKE SENIOR	What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
	More than your force move us to gentleness

ORLANDO	I almost die for food and let me have it

DUKE SENIOR	Sit down and feed and welcome to our table

ORLANDO	Speak you so gently? Pardon me I pray you
	I thought that all things had been savage here
	And therefore put I on the countenance
	Of stern commandment But whateer you are
	That in this desert inaccessible
	Under the shade of melancholy boughs
	Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
	If ever you have lookd on better days
	If ever been where bells have knolld to church
	If ever sat at any good mans feast
	If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
	And know what tis to pity and be pitied
	Let gentleness my strong enforcement be
	In the which hope I blush and hide my sword

DUKE SENIOR	True is it that we have seen better days
	And have with holy bell been knolld to church
	And sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyes
	Of drops that sacred pity hath engenderd
	And therefore sit you down in gentleness
	And take upon command what help we have
	That to your wanting may be ministerd

ORLANDO	Then but forbear your food a little while
	Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn
	And give it food There is an old poor man
	Who after me hath many a weary step
	Limpd in pure love till he be first sufficed
	Oppressd with two weak evils age and hunger
	I will not touch a bit

DUKE SENIOR	Go find him out
	And we will nothing waste till you return

ORLANDO	I thank ye and be blest for your good comfort

	Exit

DUKE SENIOR	Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
	This wide and universal theatre
	Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
	Wherein we play in

JAQUES	All the worlds a stage
	And all the men and women merely players
	They have their exits and their entrances
	And one man in his time plays many parts
	His acts being seven ages At first the infant
	Mewling and puking in the nurses arms
	And then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
	And shining morning face creeping like snail
	Unwillingly to school And then the lover
	Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
	Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier
	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
	Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
	Seeking the bubble reputation
	Even in the cannons mouth And then the justice
	In fair round belly with good capon lined
	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut
	Full of wise saws and modern instances
	And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
	Into the lean and slipperd pantaloon
	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side
	His youthful hose well saved a world too wide
	For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
	Turning again toward childish treble pipes
	And whistles in his sound Last scene of all
	That ends this strange eventful history
	Is second childishness and mere oblivion
	Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything

	Reenter ORLANDO with ADAM

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome Set down your venerable burthen
	And let him feed

ORLANDO	I thank you most for him

ADAM	So had you need
	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome fall to I will not trouble you
	As yet to question you about your fortunes
	Give us some music and good cousin sing

	SONG
AMIENS	Blow blow thou winter wind
	Thou art not so unkind
	As mans ingratitude
	Thy tooth is not so keen
	Because thou art not seen
	Although thy breath be rude
	Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
	Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
	Then heighho the holly
	This life is most jolly
	Freeze freeze thou bitter sky
	That dost not bite so nigh
	As benefits forgot
	Though thou the waters warp
	Thy sting is not so sharp
	As friend rememberd not
	Heighho sing c

DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowlands son
	As you have whisperd faithfully you were
	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
	Most truly limnd and living in your face
	Be truly welcome hither I am the duke
	That loved your father the residue of your fortune
	Go to my cave and tell me Good old man
	Thou art right welcome as thy master is
	Support him by the arm Give me your hand
	And let me all your fortunes understand

ACT III



SCENE II	The forest


	Enter ORLANDO with a paper

ORLANDO	Hang there my verse in witness of my love
	And thou thricecrowned queen of night survey
	With thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above
	Thy huntress name that my full life doth sway
	O Rosalind these trees shall be my books
	And in their barks my thoughts Ill character
	That every eye which in this forest looks
	Shall see thy virtue witnessd every where
	Run run Orlando carve on every tree
	The fair the chaste and unexpressive she

	Exit

	Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CORIN	And how like you this shepherds life Master Touchstone?

TOUCHSTONE	Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
	life but in respect that it is a shepherds life
	it is naught In respect that it is solitary I
	like it very well but in respect that it is
	private it is a very vile life Now in respect it
	is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in
	respect it is not in the court it is tedious As
	is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well
	but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much
	against my stomach Hast any philosophy in thee shepherd?

CORIN	No more but that I know the more one sickens the
	worse at ease he is and that he that wants money
	means and content is without three good friends
	that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
	burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
	great cause of the night is lack of the sun that
	he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
	complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred

TOUCHSTONE	Such a one is a natural philosopher Wast ever in
	court shepherd?

CORIN	No truly

TOUCHSTONE	Then thou art damned

CORIN	Nay I hope

TOUCHSTONE	Truly thou art damned like an illroasted egg all
	on one side

CORIN	For not being at court? Your reason

TOUCHSTONE	Why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest
	good manners if thou never sawest good manners
	then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is
	sin and sin is damnation Thou art in a parlous
	state shepherd

CORIN	Not a whit Touchstone those that are good manners
	at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
	behavior of the country is most mockable at the
	court You told me you salute not at the court but
	you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
	uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds

TOUCHSTONE	Instance briefly come instance

CORIN	Why we are still handling our ewes and their
	fells you know are greasy

TOUCHSTONE	Why do not your courtiers hands sweat? and is not
	the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
	a man? Shallow shallow A better instance I say come

CORIN	Besides our hands are hard

TOUCHSTONE	Your lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again
	A more sounder instance come

CORIN	And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
	our sheep and would you have us kiss tar? The
	courtiers hands are perfumed with civet

TOUCHSTONE	Most shallow man thou wormsmeat in respect of a
	good piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and
	perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the
	very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend the instance shepherd

CORIN	You have too courtly a wit for me Ill rest

TOUCHSTONE	Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee shallow man
	God make incision in thee thou art raw

CORIN	Sir I am a true labourer I earn that I eat get
	that I wear owe no man hate envy no mans
	happiness glad of other mens good content with my
	harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
	graze and my lambs suck

TOUCHSTONE	That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
	and the rams together and to offer to get your
	living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a
	bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a
	twelvemonth to a crookedpated old cuckoldly ram
	out of all reasonable match If thou beest not
	damned for this the devil himself will have no
	shepherds I cannot see else how thou shouldst
	scape

CORIN	Here comes young Master Ganymede my new mistresss brother

	Enter ROSALIND with a paper reading

ROSALIND	     From the east to western Ind
	No jewel is like Rosalind
	Her worth being mounted on the wind
	Through all the world bears Rosalind
	All the pictures fairest lined
	Are but black to Rosalind
	Let no fair be kept in mind
	But the fair of Rosalind

TOUCHSTONE	Ill rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
	suppers and sleepinghours excepted it is the
	right butterwomens rank to market

ROSALIND	Out fool

TOUCHSTONE	For a taste
	If a hart do lack a hind
	Let him seek out Rosalind
	If the cat will after kind
	So be sure will Rosalind
	Winter garments must be lined
	So must slender Rosalind
	They that reap must sheaf and bind
	Then to cart with Rosalind
	Sweetest nut hath sourest rind
	Such a nut is Rosalind
	He that sweetest rose will find
	Must find loves prick and Rosalind
	This is the very false gallop of verses why do you
	infect yourself with them?

ROSALIND	Peace you dull fool I found them on a tree

TOUCHSTONE	Truly the tree yields bad fruit

ROSALIND	Ill graff it with you and then I shall graff it
	with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit
	i the country for youll be rotten ere you be half
	ripe and thats the right virtue of the medlar

TOUCHSTONE	You have said but whether wisely or no let the
	forest judge

	Enter CELIA with a writing

ROSALIND	Peace Here comes my sister reading stand aside

CELIA	Reads

	Why should this a desert be?
	For it is unpeopled? No
	Tongues Ill hang on every tree
	That shall civil sayings show
	Some how brief the life of man
	Runs his erring pilgrimage
	That the stretching of a span
	Buckles in his sum of age
	Some of violated vows
	Twixt the souls of friend and friend
	But upon the fairest boughs
	Or at every sentence end
	Will I Rosalinda write
	Teaching all that read to know
	The quintessence of every sprite
	Heaven would in little show
	Therefore Heaven Nature charged
	That one body should be filld
	With all graces wideenlarged
	Nature presently distilld
	Helens cheek but not her heart
	Cleopatras majesty
	Atalantas better part
	Sad Lucretias modesty
	Thus Rosalind of many parts
	By heavenly synod was devised
	Of many faces eyes and hearts
	To have the touches dearest prized
	Heaven would that she these gifts should have
	And I to live and die her slave

ROSALIND	O most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love
	have you wearied your parishioners withal and never
	cried Have patience good people

CELIA	How now back friends Shepherd go off a little
	Go with him sirrah

TOUCHSTONE	Come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
	though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage

	Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CELIA	Didst thou hear these verses?

ROSALIND	O yes I heard them all and more too for some of
	them had in them more feet than the verses would bear

CELIA	Thats no matter the feet might bear the verses

ROSALIND	Ay but the feet were lame and could not bear
	themselves without the verse and therefore stood
	lamely in the verse

CELIA	But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
	should be hanged and carved upon these trees?

ROSALIND	I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
	before you came for look here what I found on a
	palmtree I was never so berhymed since
	Pythagoras time that I was an Irish rat which I
	can hardly remember

CELIA	Trow you who hath done this?

ROSALIND	Is it a man?

CELIA	And a chain that you once wore about his neck
	Change you colour?

ROSALIND	I prithee who?

CELIA	O Lord Lord it is a hard matter for friends to
	meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
	and so encounter

ROSALIND	Nay but who is it?

CELIA	Is it possible?

ROSALIND	Nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence
	tell me who it is

CELIA	O wonderful wonderful and most wonderful
	wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that
	out of all hooping

ROSALIND	Good my complexion dost thou think though I am
	caparisoned like a man I have a doublet and hose in
	my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
	Southsea of discovery I prithee tell me who is it
	quickly and speak apace I would thou couldst
	stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man
	out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow
	mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at
	all I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that
	may drink thy tidings

CELIA	So you may put a man in your belly

ROSALIND	Is he of Gods making? What manner of man? Is his
	head worth a hat or his chin worth a beard?

CELIA	Nay he hath but a little beard

ROSALIND	Why God will send more if the man will be
	thankful let me stay the growth of his beard if
	thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin

CELIA	It is young Orlando that tripped up the wrestlers
	heels and your heart both in an instant

ROSALIND	Nay but the devil take mocking speak sad brow and
	true maid

CELIA	I faith coz tis he

ROSALIND	Orlando?

CELIA	Orlando

ROSALIND	Alas the day what shall I do with my doublet and
	hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
	he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
	him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
	How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
	him again? Answer me in one word

CELIA	You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first tis a
	word too great for any mouth of this ages size To
	say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
	answer in a catechism

ROSALIND	But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
	mans apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
	day he wrestled?

CELIA	It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
	propositions of a lover but take a taste of my
	finding him and relish it with good observance
	I found him under a tree like a dropped acorn

ROSALIND	It may well be called Joves tree when it drops
	forth such fruit

CELIA	Give me audience good madam

ROSALIND	Proceed

CELIA	There lay he stretched along like a wounded knight

ROSALIND	Though it be pity to see such a sight it well
	becomes the ground

CELIA	Cry holla to thy tongue I prithee it curvets
	unseasonably He was furnished like a hunter

ROSALIND	O ominous he comes to kill my heart

CELIA	I would sing my song without a burden thou bringest
	me out of tune

ROSALIND	Do you not know I am a woman? when I think I must
	speak Sweet say on

CELIA	You bring me out Soft comes he not here?

	Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES

ROSALIND	Tis he slink by and note him

JAQUES	I thank you for your company but good faith I had
	as lief have been myself alone

ORLANDO	And so had I but yet for fashion sake I thank you
	too for your society

JAQUES	God be wi you lets meet as little as we can

ORLANDO	I do desire we may be better strangers

JAQUES	I pray you mar no more trees with writing
	lovesongs in their barks

ORLANDO	I pray you mar no more of my verses with reading
	them illfavouredly

JAQUES	Rosalind is your loves name?

ORLANDO	Yes just

JAQUES	I do not like her name

ORLANDO	There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
	christened

JAQUES	What stature is she of?

ORLANDO	Just as high as my heart

JAQUES	You are full of pretty answers Have you not been
	acquainted with goldsmiths wives and conned them
	out of rings?

ORLANDO	Not so but I answer you right painted cloth from
	whence you have studied your questions

JAQUES	You have a nimble wit I think twas made of
	Atalantas heels Will you sit down with me? and
	we two will rail against our mistress the world and
	all our misery

ORLANDO	I will chide no breather in the world but myself
	against whom I know most faults

JAQUES	The worst fault you have is to be in love

ORLANDO	Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue
	I am weary of you

JAQUES	By my troth I was seeking for a fool when I found
	you

ORLANDO	He is drowned in the brook look but in and you
	shall see him

JAQUES	There I shall see mine own figure

ORLANDO	Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher

JAQUES	Ill tarry no longer with you farewell good
	Signior Love

ORLANDO	I am glad of your departure adieu good Monsieur
	Melancholy

	Exit JAQUES

ROSALIND	Aside to CELIA  I will speak to him like a saucy
	lackey and under that habit play the knave with him
	Do you hear forester?

ORLANDO	Very well what would you?

ROSALIND	I pray you what ist oclock?

ORLANDO	You should ask me what time o day theres no clock
	in the forest

ROSALIND	Then there is no true lover in the forest else
	sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
	detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock

ORLANDO	And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
	been as proper?

ROSALIND	By no means sir Time travels in divers paces with
	divers persons Ill tell you who Time ambles
	withal who Time trots withal who Time gallops
	withal and who he stands still withal

ORLANDO	I prithee who doth he trot withal?

ROSALIND	Marry he trots hard with a young maid between the
	contract of her marriage and the day it is
	solemnized if the interim be but a sennight
	Times pace is so hard that it seems the length of
	seven year

ORLANDO	Who ambles Time withal?

ROSALIND	With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
	hath not the gout for the one sleeps easily because
	he cannot study and the other lives merrily because
	he feels no pain the one lacking the burden of lean
	and wasteful learning the other knowing no burden
	of heavy tedious penury these Time ambles withal

ORLANDO	Who doth he gallop withal?

ROSALIND	With a thief to the gallows for though he go as
	softly as foot can fall he thinks himself too soon there

ORLANDO	Who stays it still withal?

ROSALIND	With lawyers in the vacation for they sleep between
	term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves

ORLANDO	Where dwell you pretty youth?

ROSALIND	With this shepherdess my sister here in the
	skirts of the forest like fringe upon a petticoat

ORLANDO	Are you native of this place?

ROSALIND	As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled

ORLANDO	Your accent is something finer than you could
	purchase in so removed a dwelling

ROSALIND	I have been told so of many but indeed an old
	religious uncle of mine taught me to speak who was
	in his youth an inland man one that knew courtship
	too well for there he fell in love I have heard
	him read many lectures against it and I thank God
	I am not a woman to be touched with so many
	giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
	whole sex withal

ORLANDO	Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
	laid to the charge of women?

ROSALIND	There were none principal they were all like one
	another as halfpence are every one fault seeming
	monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it

ORLANDO	I prithee recount some of them

ROSALIND	No I will not cast away my physic but on those that
	are sick There is a man haunts the forest that
	abuses our young plants with carving Rosalind on
	their barks hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
	on brambles all forsooth deifying the name of
	Rosalind if I could meet that fancymonger I would
	give him some good counsel for he seems to have the
	quotidian of love upon him

ORLANDO	I am he that is so loveshaked I pray you tell me
	your remedy

ROSALIND	There is none of my uncles marks upon you he
	taught me how to know a man in love in which cage
	of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner

ORLANDO	What were his marks?

ROSALIND	A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and
	sunken which you have not an unquestionable
	spirit which you have not a beard neglected
	which you have not but I pardon you for that for
	simply your having in beard is a younger brothers
	revenue then your hose should be ungartered your
	bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe
	untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
	careless desolation but you are no such man you
	are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as
	loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other

ORLANDO	Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love

ROSALIND	Me believe it you may as soon make her that you
	love believe it which I warrant she is apter to
	do than to confess she does thOX AL VNX WX HUI
