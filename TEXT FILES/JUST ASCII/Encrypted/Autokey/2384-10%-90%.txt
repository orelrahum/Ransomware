Austria Economy

Overview
    Austria boasts a prosperous and stable capitalist economy with a sizable
    proportion of nationalized industry and extensive welfare benefits Thanks
    to an excellent raw material endowment a technically skilled labor force
    and strong links to German industrial firms Austria occupies specialized
    niches in European industry and services tourism banking and produces
    almost enough food to feed itself with only  of the labor force in
    agriculture Improved export prospects resulting from German unification and
    the opening of Eastern Europe boosted the economy during  and to a
    lesser extent in  GDP growth slowed from  in  to  in  
    mainly due to the weaker world economy  and is expected to drop to around
     in  Inflation is forecasted at about  while unemployment probably
    will increase moderately through  before declining in  Living
    standards are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western
    Europe Problems for the ls include an aging population the high level
    of subsidies and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budget
    capabilities Austria which has applied for EC membership was involved in
    EC and European Free Trade Association negotiations for a European Economic
    Area and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer interchange of
    goods services capital and labor within the EC

Azerbaijan Economy

Overview
    Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia
    the other Transcaucasian states It resembles the Central Asian states in
    its majority Muslim population high structural unemployment and low
    standard of living The economys most prominent products are cotton oil
    and gas Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline
    for several years With foreign assistance the oil industry might generate
    the funds needed to spur industrial development However civil unrest
    marked by armed conflict in the NagornoKarabakh region between Muslim
    Azeris and Christian Armenians makes foreign investors wary Azerbaijan
    accounts for  to  of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet
    Union Although immediate economic prospects are not favorable because of
    civil strife lack of economic reform political disputes about new economic
    arrangements and the skittishness of foreign investors Azerbaijans
    economic performance was the best of all former Soviet republics in 
    largely because of its reliance on domestic resources for industrial output
