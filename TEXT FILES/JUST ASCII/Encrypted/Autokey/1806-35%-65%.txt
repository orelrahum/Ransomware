Heartstruck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood
That all his senses bound Eve who unseen
Yet all had heard with audible lament
Discovered soon the place of her retire
O unexpected stroke worse than of Death
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
Thee native soil these happy walks and shades
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend
Quiet though sad the respite of that day
That must be mortal to us both  O flowers
That never will in other climate grow
My early visitation and my last
 t even which I bred up with tender hand
From the first opening bud and gave ye names
Who now shall rear ye to the sun or rank
Your tribes and water from the ambrosial fount?
Thee lastly nuptial bower by me adorned
With what to sight or smell was sweet from thee
How shall I part and whither wander down
Into a lower world to this obscure
And wild? how shall we breathe in other air
Less pure accustomed to immortal fruits?
Whom thus the Angel interrupted mild
Lament not Eve but patiently resign
What justly thou hast lost nor set thy heart
Thus overfond on that which is not thine
Thy going is not lonely with thee goes
Thy husband whom to follow thou art bound
Where he abides think there thy native soil
Adam by this from the cold sudden damp
Recovering and his scattered spirits returned
To Michael thus his humble words addressed
Celestial whether among the Thrones or named
Of them the highest for such of shape may seem
Prince above princes gently hast thou told
Thy message which might else in telling wound
And in performing end us what besides
Of sorrow and dejection and despair
Our frailty can sustain thy tidings bring
Departure from this happy place our sweet
Recess and only consolation left
Familiar to our eyes all places else
Inhospitable appear and desolate
Nor knowing us nor known  And if by prayer
Incessant I could hope to change the will
Of Him who all things can I would not cease
To weary him with my assiduous cries
But prayer against his absolute decree
No more avails than breath against the wind
Blown stifling back on him that breathes it forth
Therefore to his great bidding I submit
This most afflicts me that departing hence
As from his face I shall be hid deprived
His blessed countenance  Here I could frequent
With worship place by place where he vouchsafed
Presence Divine and to my sons relate
On this mount he appeared under this tree
Stood visible among these pines his voice
I heard here with him at this fountain talked
So many grateful altars I would rear
Of grassy turf and pile up every stone
Of lustre from the brook in memory
Or monument to ages and theron
Offer sweetsmelling gums and fruits and flowers
In yonder nether world where shall I seek
His bright appearances or footstep trace?
For though I fled him angry yet recalled
To life prolonged and promised race I now
Gladly behold though but his utmost skirts
Of glory and far off his steps adore
To whom thus Michael with regard benign
Adam thou knowest Heaven his and all the Earth
Not this rock only his Omnipresence fills
Land sea and air and every kind that lives
Fomented by his virtual power and warmed
All the earth he gave thee to possess and rule
No despicable gift surmise not then
His presence to these narrow bounds confined
Of Paradise or Eden this had been
Perhaps thy capital seat from whence had spread
All generations and had hither come
From all the ends of the earth to celebrate
And reverence thee their great progenitor
But this preeminence thou hast lost brought down
To dwell on even ground now with thy sons
Yet doubt not but in valley and in plain
God is as here and will be found alike
Present and of his presence many a sign
Still following thee still compassing thee round
With goodness and paternal love his face
Express and of his steps the track divine
Which that thou mayest believe and be confirmed
Ere thou from hence depart know I am sent
To show thee what shall come in future days
To thee and to thy offspring good with bad
Expect to hear supernal grace contending
With sinfulness of men thereby to learn
True patience and to temper joy with fear
And pious sorrow equally inured
By moderation either state to bear
Prosperous or adverse so shalt thou lead
Safest thy life and best prepared endure
Thy mortal passage when it comesAscend
This hill let Eve for I have drenched her eyes
