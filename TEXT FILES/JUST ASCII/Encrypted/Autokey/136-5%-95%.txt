          Involved in this affair
        He trusts to you to set them free
          Exactly as we were

        My notion was that you had been
          Before she had this fit
        An obstacle that came between
          Him and ourselves and it

        Dont let him know she liked them best
          For this must ever be
        A secret kept from all the rest
          Between yourself and me

  Thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet
said the King rubbing his hands so now let the jury

  If any one of them can explain it said Alice she had
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit
afraid of interrupting him Ill give him sixpence  I dont
believe theres an atom of meaning in it

  The jury all wrote down on their slates SHE doesnt believe
theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to
explain the paper

  If theres no meaning in it said the King that saves a
world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any  And
yet I dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his
knee and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some
meaning in them after all  "SAID I COULD NOT SWIM" you
cant swim can you? he added turning to the Knave

  The Knave shook his head sadly  Do I look like it? he said
Which he certainly did NOT being made entirely of cardboard

  All right so far said the King and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself  "WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE" thats
the jury of course "I GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO" why
that must be what he did with the tarts you know

  But it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU" said
Alice

  Why there they are said the King triumphantly pointing to
the tarts on the table  Nothing can be clearer than THAT
Then again"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT"  you never had fits my
dear I think? he said to the Queen

  Never said the Queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke  The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no
mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was
trickling down his face as long as it lasted

  Then the words dont FIT you said the King looking round
the court with a smile  There was a dead silence

  Its a pun the King added in an offended tone and
everybody laughed Let the jury consider their verdict the
King said for about the twentieth time that day

  No no said the Queen  Sentence firstverdict afterwards

  Stuff and nonsense said Alice loudly  The idea of having
the sentence first

  Hold your tongue said the Queen turning purple

  I wont said Alice

  Off with her head the Queen shouted at the top of her voice
Nobody moved

  Who cares for you? said Alice she had grown to her full
size by this time  Youre nothing but a pack of cards

  At this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying
down upon her  she gave a little scream half of fright and half
of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on
the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face

  Wake up Alice dear said her sister Why what a long
sleep youve had

  Oh Ive had such a curious dream said Alice and she told
her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and
when she had finished her sister kissed her and said It WAS a
curious dream dear certainly  but now run in to your tea its
getting late  So Alice got up and ran off thinking while she
ran as well she might what a wonderful dream it had been

  But her sister sat still just as she left her leaning her
head on her hand watching the setting sun and thinking of
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures till she too began
dreaming after a fashion and this was her dream

  First she dreamed of little Alice herself and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her
voice and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyesand
still as she listened or seemed to listen the whole place
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
sisters dream

  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
bythe frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their neverending meal
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the
Duchesss knee while plates and dishes crashed around itonce
more the shriek of the Gryphon the squeaking of the Lizards
slatepencil and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs
filled the air mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle

  So she sat on with closed eyes and half believed herself in
Wonderland though she knew she had but to open them again and
all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only
rustling in the wind and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep
bells and the Queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boyand the sneeze of the baby the shriek of the Gryphon and
all thy other queer noises would change she knew to the
confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtles
heavy sobs

  Lastly she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would in the aftertime be herself a grown woman and how
she would keep through all her riper years the simple and
loving heart of her childhood  and how she would gather about
her other little children and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago  and how she would feel with all their
simple sorrows and find a pleasure in all their simple joys
remembering her own childlife and the happy summer days

ACT I



SCENE I	Orchard of Olivers house


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

ORLANDO	As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion
	bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns
	and as thou sayest charged my brother on his
	blessing to breed me well and there begins my
	sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and
	report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part
	he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more
	properly stays me here at home unkept for call you
	that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that
	differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
	are bred better for besides that they are fair
	with their feeding they are taught their manage
	and to that end riders dearly hired but I his
	brother gain nothing under him but growth for the
	which his animals on his dunghills are as much
	bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so
	plentifully gives me the something that nature gave
	me his countenance seems to take from me he lets
	me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
	brother and as much as in him lies mines my
	gentility with my education This is it Adam that
	grieves me and the spirit of my father which I
	think is within me begins to mutiny against this
	servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I
	know no wise remedy how to avoid it

ADAM	Yonder comes my master your brother

ORLANDO	Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will
	shake me up

ORLANDO	Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God
	made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness

OLIVER	Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile

ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
	What prodigal portion have I spent that I should
	come to such penury?

OLIVER	Know you where your are sir?

ORLANDO	O sir very well here in your orchard

OLIVER	Know you before whom sir?

ORLANDO	Ay better than him I am before knows me I know
	you are my eldest brother and in the gentle
	condition of blood you should so know me The
	courtesy of nations allows you my better in that
	you are the firstborn but the same tradition
	takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers
	betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as
	you albeit I confess your coming before me is
	nearer to his reverence

OLIVER	What boy

ORLANDO	Come come elder brother you are too young in this

OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me villain?

ORLANDO	I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir
	Rowland de Boys he was my father and he is thricX
