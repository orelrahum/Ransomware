LE BEAU	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles the
	dukes wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him
	and broke three of his ribs that there is little
	hope of life in him so he served the second and
	so the third Yonder they lie the poor old man
	their father making such pitiful dole over them
	that all the beholders take his part with weeping

ROSALIND	Alas

TOUCHSTONE	But what is the sport monsieur that the ladies
	have lost?

LE BEAU	Why this that I speak of

TOUCHSTONE	Thus men may grow wiser every day it is the first
	time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
	for ladies

CELIA	Or I I promise thee

ROSALIND	But is there any else longs to see this broken music
	in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
	ribbreaking? Shall we see this wrestling cousin?

LE BEAU	You must if you stay here for here is the place
	appointed for the wrestling and they are ready to
	perform it

CELIA	Yonder sure they are coming let us now stay and see it

	Flourish Enter DUKE FREDERICK Lords ORLANDO

CELIA	Alas he is too young yet he looks successfully

DUKE FREDERICK	How now daughter and cousin are you crept hither
	to see the wrestling?

ROSALIND	Ay my liege so please you give us leave

DUKE FREDERICK	You will take little delight in it I can tell you
	there is such odds in the man In pity of the
	challengers youth I would fain dissuade him but he
	will not be entreated Speak to him ladies see if
	you can move him

CELIA	Call him hither good Monsieur Le Beau

DUKE FREDERICK	Do so Ill not be by

LE BEAU	Monsieur the challenger the princesses call for you

ORLANDO	I attend them with all respect and duty

ROSALIND	Young man have you challenged Charles the wrestler?

ORLANDO	No fair princess he is the general challenger I
	come but in as others do to try with him the
	strength of my youth

CELIA	Young gentleman your spirits are too bold for your
	years You have seen cruel proof of this mans
	strength if you saw yourself with your eyes or
	knew yourself with your judgment the fear of your
	adventure would counsel you to a more equal
	enterprise We pray you for your own sake to
	embrace your own safety and give over this attempt

ROSALIND	Do young sir your reputation shall not therefore
	be misprised we will make it our suit to the duke
	that the wrestling might not go forward

ORLANDO	I beseech you punish me not with your hard
	thoughts wherein I confess me much guilty to deny
	so fair and excellent ladies any thing But let
	your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
	trial wherein if I be foiled there is but one
	shamed that was never gracious if killed but one
	dead that was willing to be so I shall do my
	friends no wrong for I have none to lament me the
	world no injury for in it I have nothing only in
	the world I fill up a place which may be better
	supplied when I have made it empty

ROSALIND	The little strength that I have I would it were with you

CELIA	And mine to eke out hers

ROSALIND	Fare you well pray heaven I be deceived in you

CELIA	Your hearts desires be with you

CHARLES	Come where is this young gallant that is so
	desirous to lie with his mother earth?

ORLANDO	Ready sir but his will hath in it a more modest working

DUKE FREDERICK	You shall try but one fall

CHARLES	No I warrant your grace you shall not entreat him
	to a second that have so mightily persuaded him
	from a first

ORLANDO	An you mean to mock me after you should not have
	mocked me before but come your ways

ROSALIND	Now Hercules be thy speed young man

CELIA	I would I were invisible to catch the strong
	fellow by the leg

	They wrestle

ROSALIND	O excellent young man

CELIA	If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye I can tell who
	should down

	Shout CHARLES is thrown

DUKE FREDERICK	No more no more

ORLANDO	Yes I beseech your grace I am not yet well breathed

DUKE FREDERICK	How dost thou Charles?

LE BEAU	He cannot speak my lord

DUKE FREDERICK	Bear him away What is thy name young man?

ORLANDO	Orlando my liege the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys

DUKE FREDERICK	I would thou hadst been son to some man else
	The world esteemd thy father honourable
	But I did find him still mine enemy
	Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed
	Hadst thou descended from another house
	But fare thee well thou art a gallant youth
	I would thou hadst told me of another father

	Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK train and LE BEAU

CELIA	Were I my father coz would I do this?

ORLANDO	I am more proud to be Sir Rowlands son
	His youngest son and would not change that calling
	To be adopted heir to Frederick

ROSALIND	My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul
	And all the world was of my fathers mind
	Had I before known this young man his son
	I should have given him tears unto entreaties
	Ere he should thus have ventured

CELIA	Gentle cousin
	Let us go thank him and encourage him
	My fathers rough and envious disposition
	Sticks me at heart Sir you have well deserved
	If you do keep your promises in love
	But justly as you have exceeded all promise
	Your mistress shall be happy

ROSALIND	Gentleman

	Giving him a chain from her neck

	Wear this for me one out of suits with fortune
	That could give more but that her hand lacks means
	Shall we go coz?

CELIA	                  Ay Fare you well fair gentleman

ORLANDO	Can I not say I thank you? My better parts
	Are all thrown down and that which here stands up
	Is but a quintain a mere lifeless block

ROSALIND	He calls us back my pride fell with my fortunes
	Ill ask him what he would Did you call sir?
	Sir you have wrestled well and overthrown
	More than your enemies

CELIA	Will you go coz?

ROSALIND	Have with you Fare you well

	Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

ORLANDO	What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
	I cannot speak to her yet she urged conference
	O poor Orlando thou art overthrown
	Or Charles or something weaker masters thee

	Reenter LE BEAU

LE BEAU	Good sir I do in friendship counsel you
	To leave this place Albeit you have deserved
	High commendation true applause and love
	Yet such is now the dukes condition
	That he misconstrues all that you have done
	The duke is humorous what he is indeed
	More suits you to conceive than I to speak of

ORLANDO	I thank you sir and pray you tell me this
	Which of the two was daughter of the duke
	That here was at the wrestling?

LE BEAU	Neither his daughter if we judge by manners
	But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
	The other is daughter to the banishd duke
	And here detaind by her usurping uncle
	To keep his daughter company whose loves
	Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters
	But I can tell you that of late this duke
	Hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece
	Grounded upon no other argument
	But that the people praise her for her virtues
	And pity her for her good fathers sake
	And on my life his malice gainst the lady
	Will suddenly break forth Sir fare you well
	Hereafter in a better world than this
	I shall desire more love and knowledge of you

ORLANDO	I rest much bounden to you fare you well

	Exit LE BEAU

	Thus must I from the smoke into the smother
	From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother
	But heavenly Rosalind

	Exit

SCENE III	A room in the palace


	Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

CELIA	Why cousin why Rosalind Cupid have mercy not a word?

ROSALIND	Not one to throw at a dog

CELIA	No thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
	curs throw some of them at me come lame me with reasons

ROSALIND	Then there were two cousins laid up when the one
	should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
	without any

CELIA	But is all this for your father?

ROSALIND	No some of it is for my childs father O how
	full of briers is this workingday world

CELIA	They are but burs cousin thrown upon thee in
	holiday foolery if we walk not in the trodden
	paths our very petticoats will catch them

ROSALIND	I could shake them off my coat these burs are in my heart

CELIA	Hem them away

ROSALIND	I would try if I could cry hem and have him

CELIA	Come come wrestle with thy affections

ROSALIND	O they take the part of a better wrestler than myself

CELIA	O a good wish upon you you will try in time in
	despite of a fall But turning these jests out of
	service let us talk in good earnest is it
	possible on such a sudden you should fall into so
	strong a liking with old Sir Rowlands youngest son?

ROSALIND	The duke my father loved his father dearly

CELIA	Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
	dearly? By this kind of chase I should hate him
	for my father hated his father dearly yet I hate
	not Orlando

ROSALIND	No faith hate him not for my sake

CELIA	Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?

ROSALIND	Let me love him for that and do you love him
	because I do Look here comes the duke

CELIA	With his eyes full of anger

	Enter DUKE FREDERICK with Lords

DUKE FREDERICK	Mistress dispatch you with your safest haste
	And get you from our court

ROSALIND	Me uncle?

DUKE FREDERICK	You cousin
	Within these ten days if that thou best found
	So near our public court as twenty miles
	Thou diest for it

ROSALIND	                  I do beseech your grace
	Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me
	If with myself I hold intelligence
	Or have acquaintance with mine own desires
	If that I do not dream or be not frantic
	As I do trust I am notthen dear uncle
	Never so much as in a thought unborn
	Did I offend your highness

DUKE FREDERICK	Thus do all traitors
	If their purgation did consist in words
	They are as innocent as grace itself
	Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not

ROSALIND	Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor
	Tell me whereon the likelihood depends

DUKE FREDERICK	Thou art thy fathers daughter theres enough

ROSALIND	So was I when your highness took his dukedom
	So was I when your highness banishd him
	Treason is not inherited my lord
	Or if we did derive it from our friends
	Whats that to me? my father was no traitor
	Then good my liege mistake me not so much
	To think my poverty is treacherous

CELIA	Dear sovereign hear me speak

DUKE FREDERICK	Ay Celia we stayd her for your sake
	Else had she with her father ranged along

CELIA	I did not then entreat to have her stay
	It was your pleasure and your own remorse
	I was too young that time to value her
	But now I know her if she be a traitor
	Why so am I we still have slept together
	Rose at an instant learnd playd eat together
	And wheresoever we went like Junos swans
	Still we went coupled and inseparable

DUKE FREDERICK	She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness
	Her very silence and her patience
	Speak to the people and they pity her
	Thou art a fool she robs thee of thy name
	And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
	When she is gone Then open not thy lips
	Firm and irrevocable is my doom
	Which I have passd upon her she is banishd

CELIA	Pronounce that sentence then on me my liege
	I cannot live out of her company

DUKE FREDERICK	You are a fool You niece provide yourself
	If you outstay the time upon mine honour
	And in the greatness of my word you die

	Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords

CELIA	O my poor Rosalind whither wilt thou go?
	Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine
	I charge thee be not thou more grieved than I am

ROSALIND	I have more cause

CELIA	                  Thou hast not cousin
	Prithee be cheerful knowst thou not the duke
	Hath banishd me his daughter?

ROSALIND	That he hath not

CELIA	No hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
	Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one
	Shall we be sunderd? shall we part sweet girl?
	No let my father seek another heir
	Therefore devise with me how we may fly
	Whither to go and what to bear with us
	And do not seek to take your change upon you
	To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out
	For by this heaven now at our sorrows pale
	Say what thou canst Ill go along with thee

ROSALIND	Why whither shall we go?

CELIA	To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden

ROSALIND	Alas what danger will it be to us
	Maids as we are to travel forth so far
	Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold

CELIA	Ill put myself in poor and mean attire
	And with a kind of umber smirch my face
	The like do you so shall we pass along
	And never stir assailants

ROSALIND	Were it not better
	Because that I am more than common tall
	That I did suit me all points like a man?
	A gallant curtleaxe upon my thigh
	A boarspear in my hand andin my heart
	Lie there what hidden womans fear there will
	Well have a swashing and a martial outside
	As many other mannish cowards have
	That do outface it with their semblances

CELIA	What shall I call thee when thou art a man?

ROSALIND	Ill have no worse a name than Joves own page
	And therefore look you call me Ganymede
	But what will you be calld?

CELIA	Something that hath a reference to my state
	No longer Celia but Aliena

ROSALIND	But cousin what if we assayd to steal
	The clownish fool out of your fathers court?
	Would he not be a comfort to our travel?

CELIA	Hell go along oer the wide world with me
	Leave me alone to woo him Lets away
	And get our jewels and our wealth together
	Devise the fittest time and safest way
	To hide us from pursuit that will be made
	After my flight Now go we in content
	To liberty and not to banishment

SCENE I	The Forest of Arden


	Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and two or three Lords
	like foresters

DUKE SENIOR	Now my comates and brothers in exile
	Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
	Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
	More free from peril than the envious court?
	Here feel we but the penalty of Adam
	The seasons difference as the icy fang
	And churlish chiding of the winters wind
	Which when it bites and blows upon my body
	Even till I shrink with cold I smile and say
	This is no flattery these are counsellors
	That feelingly persuade me what I am
	Sweet are the uses of adversity
	Which like the toad ugly and venomous
	Wears yet a precious jewel in his head
	And this our life exempt from public haunt
	Finds tongues in trees books in the running brooks
	Sermons in stones and good in every thing
	I would not change it

AMIENS	Happy is your grace
	That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
	Into so quiet and so sweet a style

DUKE SENIOR	Come shall we go and kill us venison?
	And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools
	Being native burghers of this desert city
	Should in their own confines with forked heads
	Have their round haunches gored

First Lord	Indeed my lord
	The melancholy Jaques grieves at that
	And in that kind swears you do more usurp
	Than doth your brother that hath banishd you
	Today my Lord of Amiens and myself
	Did steal behind him as he lay along
	Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
	Upon the brook that brawls along this wood
	To the which place a poor sequesterd stag
	That from the hunters aim had taen a hurt
	Did come to languish and indeed my lord
	The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
	That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
	Almost to bursting and the big round tears
	Coursed one another down his innocent nose
	In piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
	Much marked of the melancholy Jaques
	Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook
	Augmenting it with tears

DUKE SENIOR	But what said Jaques?
	Did he not moralize this spectacle?

First Lord	O yes into a thousand similes
	First for his weeping into the needless stream
	Poor deer quoth he thou makest a testament
	As worldlings do giving thy sum of more
	To that which had too much then being there alone
	Left and abandond of his velvet friends
	Tis right quoth he thus misery doth part
	The flux of company anon a careless herd
	Full of the pasture jumps along by him
	And never stays to greet him Ay quoth Jaques
	Sweep on you fat and greasy citizens
	Tis just the fashion wherefore do you look
	Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?
	Thus most invectively he pierceth through
	The body of the country city court
	Yea and of this our life swearing that we
	Are mere usurpers tyrants and whats worse
	To fright the animals and to kill them up
	In their assignd and native dwellingplace

DUKE SENIOR	And did you leave him in this contemplation?

Second Lord	We did my lord weeping and commenting
	Upon the sobbing deer

DUKE SENIOR	Show me the place
	I love to cope him in these sullen fits
	For then hes full of matter

First Lord	Ill bring you to him straight

	Enter DUKE FREDERICK with Lords

DUKE FREDERICK	Can it be possible that no man saw them?
	It cannot be some villains of my court
	Are of consent and sufferance in this

First Lord	I cannot hear of any that did see her
	The ladies her attendants of her chamber
	Saw her abed and in the morning early
	They found the bed untreasured of their mistress

Second Lord	My lord the roynish clown at whom so oft
	Your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
	Hisperia the princess gentlewoman
	Confesses that she secretly oerheard
	Your daughter and her cousin much commend
	The parts and graces of the wrestler
	That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles
	And she believes wherever they are gone
	That youth is surely in their company

DUKE FREDERICK	Send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
	If he be absent bring his brother to me
	Ill make him find him do this suddenly
	And let not search and inquisition quail
	To bring again these foolish runaways

SCENE III	Before OLIVERS house


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM meeting

ORLANDO	Whos there?

ADAM	What my young master? O my gentle master
	O my sweet master O you memory
	Of old Sir Rowland why what make you here?
	Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
	And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant?
	Why would you be so fond to overcome
	The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
	Your praise is come too swiftly home before you
	Know you not master to some kind of men
	Their graces serve them but as enemies?
	No more do yours your virtues gentle master
	Are sanctified and holy traitors to you
	O what a world is this when what is comely
	Envenoms him that bears it

ORLANDO	Why whats the matter?

ADAM	O unhappy youth
	Come not within these doors within this roof
	The enemy of all your graces lives
	Your brotherno no brother yet the son
	Yet not the son I will not call him son
	Of him I was about to call his father
	Hath heard your praises and this night he means
	To burn the lodging where you use to lie
	And you within it if he fail of that
	He will have other means to cut you off
	I overheard him and his practises
	This is no place this house is but a butchery
	Abhor it fear it do not enter it

ORLANDO	Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go?

ADAM	No matter whither so you come not here

ORLANDO	What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
	Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
	A thievish living on the common road?
	This I must do or know not what to do
	Yet this I will not do do how I can
	I rather will subject me to the malice
	Of a diverted blood and bloody brother

ADAM	But do not so I have five hundred crowns
	The thrifty hire I saved under your father
	Which I did store to be my fosternurse
	When service should in my old limbs lie lame
	And unregarded age in corners thrown
	Take that and He that doth the ravens feed
	Yea providently caters for the sparrow
	Be comfort to my age Here is the gold
	And all this I give you Let me be your servant
	Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty
	For in my youth I never did apply
	Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
	Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
	The means of weakness and debility
	Therefore my age is as a lusty winter
	Frosty but kindly let me go with you
	Ill do the service of a younger man
	In all your business and necessities

ORLANDO	O good old man how well in thee appears
	The constant service of the antique world
	When service sweat for duty not for meed
	Thou art not for the fashion of these times
	Where none will sweat but for promotion
	And having that do choke their service up
	Even with the having it is not so with thee
	But poor old man thou prunest a rotten tree
	That cannot so much as a blossom yield
	In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
	But come thy ways well go along together
	And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
	Well light upon some settled low content

ADAM	Master go on and I will follow thee
	To the last gasp with truth and loyalty
	From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
	Here lived I but now live here no more
	At seventeen years many their fortunes seek
	But at fourscore it is too late a week
	Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
	Than to die well and not my masters debtor
