Romania Economy

Overview
    Industry which accounts for about onethird of the labor force and
    generates over half the GDP suffers from an aging capital plant and
    persistent shortages of energy The year  witnessed about a  drop in
    industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor
    unrest In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with
    flooding mismanagement shortages of inputs and disarray caused by the
    dismantling of cooperatives A shortage of fuel and equipment in 
    contributed to a lackluster harvest a problem compounded by corruption and
    a poor distribution system The new government is loosening the tight
    central controls of CEAUSESCUS command economy It has instituted moderate
    land reforms with more than onehalf of cropland now in private hands and
    it has liberalized private agricultural output Also the new regime is
    permitting the establishment of private enterprises largely in services
    handicrafts and smallscale industry A law providing for the privatization
    of large state firms has been passed Most of the large state firms have
    been converted into jointstock companies but the selling of shares and
    assets to private owners has been delayed While the government has halted
    the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency
    export markets supplies remain scarce in some areas Furthermore real
    wages in Romania fell about  in  contributing to the unrest which
    forced the resignation of ROMAN in September The new government continues
    to impose price ceilings on key consumer items
