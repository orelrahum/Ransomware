	And let him feed

ORLANDO	I thank you most for him

ADAM	So had you need
	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome fall to I will not trouble you
	As yet to question you about your fortunes
	Give us some music and good cousin sing

	SONG
AMIENS	Blow blow thou winter wind
	Thou art not so unkind
	As mans ingratitude
	Thy tooth is not so keen
	Because thou art not seen
	Although thy breath be rude
	Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
	Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
	Then heighho the holly
	This life is most jolly
	Freeze freeze thou bitter sky
	That dost not bite so nigh
	As benefits forgot
	Though thou the waters warp
	Thy sting is not so sharp
	As friend rememberd not
	Heighho sing c

DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowlands son
	As you have whisperd faithfully you were
	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
	Most truly limnd and living in your face
	Be truly welcome hither I am the duke
	That loved your father the residue of your fortune
	Go to my cave and tell me Good old man
	Thou art right welcome as thy master is
	Support him by the arm Give me your hand
	And let me all your fortunes understand

	Enter ORLANDO with a paper

ORLANDO	Hang there my verse in witness of my love
	And thou thricecrowned queen of night survey
	With thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above
	Thy huntress name that my full life doth sway
	O Rosalind these trees shall be my books
	And in their barks my thoughts Ill character
	That every eye which in this forest looks
	Shall see thy virtue witnessd every where

	The fair the chaste and unexpressive she
