	not well cut he disabled my judgment this is
	called the Reply Churlish If again it was not
	well cut he would answer I spake not true this
	is called the Reproof Valiant If again it was not
	well cut he would say I lied this is called the
	Countercheque Quarrelsome and so to the Lie
	Circumstantial and the Lie Direct

JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial
	nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct and so we
	measured swords and parted

	Meantime forget this newfalln dignity
	And fall into our rustic revelry
	Play music And you brides and bridegrooms all

	but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord

	no bush tis true that a good play needs no
	epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes
	and good plays prove the better by the help of good
