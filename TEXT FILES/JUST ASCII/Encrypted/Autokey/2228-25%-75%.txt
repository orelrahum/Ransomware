Down dropt and all the faded roses shed
Speechless he stood and pale till thus at length
First to himself he inward silence broke
O fairest of Creation last and best
Of all Gods works Creature in whom excelled
Whatever can to sight or thought be formed
Holy divine good amiable or sweet
How art thou lost how on a sudden lost
Defaced deflowered and now to death devote
Rather how hast thou yielded to transgress
The strict forbiddance how to violate
The sacred fruit forbidden  Some cursed fraud
Of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown
And me with thee hath ruined for with thee
Certain my resolution is to die
How can I live without thee how forego
Thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined
To live again in these wild woods forlorn
Should God create another Eve and I
Another rib afford yet loss of thee
Would never from my heart no noI feel
The link of Nature draw me flesh of flesh
Bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
Mine never shall be parted bliss or woe
So having said as one from sad dismay
Recomforted and after thoughts disturbed
Submitting to what seemed remediless
Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned
Bold deed thou hast presumed adventurous Eve
And peril great provoked who thus hast dared
Had it been only coveting to eye
That sacred fruit sacred to abstinence
Much more to taste it under ban to touch
But past who can recall or done undo?
Not God Omnipotent nor Fate yet so
Perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
Is not so heinous now foretasted fruit
Profaned first by the serpent by him first
Made common and unhallowed ere our taste
Nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives
Lives as thou saidst and gains to live as Man
Higher degree of life inducement strong
To us as likely tasting to attain
Proportional ascent which cannot be
But to be Gods or Angels demiGods
Nor can I think that God Creator wise
Though threatening will in earnest so destroy
Us his prime creatures dignified so high
Set over all his works which in our fall
For us created needs with us must fail
Dependant made so God shall uncreate
Be frustrate do undo and labour lose
Not well conceived of God who though his power
Creation could repeat yet would be loth
Us to abolish lest the Adversary
Triumph and say "Fickle their state whom God
"Most favours who can please him long? Me first
"He ruined now Mankind whom will he next?"
Matter of scorn not to be given the Foe
However I with thee have fixed my lot
Certain to undergo like doom  If death
Consort with thee death is to me as life
So forcible within my heart I feel
The bond of Nature draw me to my own
My own in thee for what thou art is mine
Our state cannot be severed we are one
One flesh to lose thee were to lose myself
So Adam and thus Eve to him replied
O glorious trial of exceeding love
Illustrious evidence example high
Engaging me to emulate but short
Of thy perfection how shall I attain
Adam from whose dear side I boast me sprung
And gladly of our union hear thee speak
One heart one soul in both whereof good proof
This day affords declaring thee resolved
Rather than death or aught than death more dread
Shall separate us linked in love so dear
To undergo with me one guilt one crime
If any be of tasting this fair fruit
Whose virtue for of good still good proceeds
Direct or by occasion hath presented
This happy trial of thy love which else
So eminently never had been known?
Were it I thought death menaced would ensue
This my attempt I would sustain alone
The worst and not persuade thee rather die
Deserted than oblige thee with a fact
Pernicious to thy peace chiefly assured
Remarkably so late of thy so true
So faithful love unequalled but I feel
Far otherwise the event not death but life
Augmented opened eyes new hopes new joys
Taste so divine that what of sweet before
Hath touched my sense flat seems to this and harsh
On my experience Adam freely taste
And fear of death deliver to the winds
So saying she embraced him and for joy
Tenderly wept much won that he his love
Had so ennobled as of choice to incur
Divine displeasure for her sake or death
In recompence for such compliance bad
Such recompence best merits from the bough
She gave him of that fair enticing fruit
With liberal hand he scrupled not to eat
Against his better knowledge not deceived
But fondly overcome with female charm
Earth trembled from her entrails as again
In pangs and Nature gave a second groan
Sky loured and muttering thunder some sad drops
Wept at completing of the mortal sin
Original while Adam took no thought
Eating his fill nor Eve to iterate
Her former trespass feared the more to sooth
Him with her loved society that now
As with new wine intoxicated both
They swim in mirth and fancy that they feel
Divinity within them breeding wings
Wherewith to scorn the earth  But that false fruit
Far other operation first displayed
Carnal desire inflaming he on Eve
Began to cast lascivious eyes she him
As wantonly repaid in lust they burn
Till Adam thus gan Eve to dalliance move
Eve now I see thou art exact of taste
And elegant of sapience no small part
Since to each meaning savour we apply
And palate call judicious I the praise
Yield thee so well this day thou hast purveyed
Much pleasure we have lost while we abstained
From this delightful fruit nor known till now
True relish tasting if such pleasure be
In things to us forbidden it might be wished
For this one tree had been forbidden ten
But come so well refreshed now let us play
As meet is after such delicious fare
For never did thy beauty since the day
I saw thee first and wedded thee adorned
With all perfections so inflame my sense
With ardour to enjoy thee fairer now
Than ever bounty of this virtuous tree
So said he and forbore not glance or toy
Of amorous intent well understood
Of Eve whose eye darted contagious fire
Her hand he seised and to a shady bank
Thick overhead with verdant roof imbowered
He led her nothing loth flowers were the couch
Pansies and violets and asphodel
And hyacinth  Earths freshest softest lap
There they their fill of love and loves disport
Took largely of their mutual guilt the seal
The solace of their sin till dewy sleep
Oppressed them wearied with their amorous play
Soon as the force of that fallacious fruit
That with exhilarating vapour bland
About their spirits had played and inmost powers
Made err was now exhaled and grosser sleep
Bred of unkindly fumes with conscious dreams
Incumbered now had left them up they rose
As from unrest and each the other viewing
Soon found their eyes how opened and their minds
How darkened innocence that as a veil
Had shadowed them from knowing ill was gone
Just confidence and native righteousness
And honour from about them naked left
To guilty Shame he covered but his robe
Uncovered more  So rose the Danite strong
Herculean Samson from the harlotlap
Of Philistean Dalilah and waked
Shorn of his strength  They destitute and bare
Of all their virtue  Silent and in face
Confounded long they sat as strucken mute
Till Adam though not less than Eve abashed
At length gave utterance to these words constrained
O Eve in evil hour thou didst give ear
To that false worm of whomsoever taught
To counterfeit Mans voice true in our fall
False in our promised rising since our eyes
Opened we find indeed and find we know
Both good and evil good lost and evil got
Bad fruit of knowledge if this be to know
Which leaves us naked thus of honour void
Of innocence of faith of purity
Our wonted ornaments now soiled and stained
And in our faces evident the signs
Of foul concupiscence whence evil store
Even shame the last of evils of the first
Be sure thenHow shall I behold the face
Henceforth of God or Angel erst with joy
And rapture so oft beheld?  Those heavenly shapes
Will dazzle now this earthly with their blaze
Insufferably bright  O might I here
In solitude live savage in some glade
Obscured where highest woods impenetrable
To star or sunlight spread their umbrage broad
And brown as evening  Cover me ye Pines
Ye Cedars with innumerable boughs
Hide me where I may never see them more
But let us now as in bad plight devise
What best may for the present serve to hide
The parts of each from other that seem most
To shame obnoxious and unseemliest seen
Some tree whose broad smooth leaves together sewed
And girded on our loins may cover round
Those middle parts that this new comer Shame
There sit not and reproach us as unclean
So counselled he and both together went
Into the thickest wood there soon they chose
The figtree not that kind for fruit renowned
But such as at this day to Indians known
In Malabar or Decan spreads her arms
Branching so broad and long that in the ground
The bended twigs take root and daughters grow
About the mother tree a pillared shade
High overarched and echoing walks between
There oft the Indian herdsman shunning heat
Shelters in cool and tends his pasturing herds
At loopholes cut through thickest shade  Those leaves
They gathered broad as Amazonian targe
And with what skill they had together sewed
To gird their waist vain covering if to hide
Their guilt and dreaded shame  O how unlike
To that first naked glory  Such of late
Columbus found the American so girt
With feathered cincture naked else and wild
Among the trees on isles and woody shores
Thus fenced and as they thought their shame in part
Covered but not at rest or ease of mind
They sat them down to weep nor only tears
Rained at their eyes but high winds worse within
Began to rise high passions anger hate
Mistrust suspicion discord and shook sore
Their inward state of mind calm region once
And full of peace now tost and turbulent
For Understanding ruled not and the Will
Heard not her lore both in subjection now
To sensual Appetite who from beneath
Usurping over sovran Reason claimed
Superiour sway From thus distempered breast
Adam estranged in look and altered style
Speech intermitted thus to Eve renewed
Would thou hadst hearkened to my words and staid
With me as I besought thee when that strange
Desire of wandering this unhappy morn
I know not whence possessed thee we had then
Remained still happy not as now despoiled
Of all our good shamed naked miserable
Let none henceforth seek needless cause to approve
The faith they owe when earnestly they seek
Such proof conclude they then begin to fail
To whom soon moved with touch of blame thus Eve
What words have passed thy lips Adam severe
Imputest thou that to my default or will
Of wandering as thou callest it which who knows
But might as ill have happened thou being by
Or to thyself perhaps?  Hadst thou been there
Or here the attempt thou couldst not have discerned
Fraud in the Serpent speaking as he spake
No ground of enmity between us known
Why he should mean me ill or seek to harm
Was I to have never parted from thy side?
As good have grown there still a lifeless rib
Being as I am why didst not thou the head
Command me absolutely not to go
Going into such danger as thou saidst?
Too facile then thou didst not much gainsay
Nay didst permit approve and fair dismiss
Hadst thou been firm and fixed in thy dissent
Neither had I transgressed nor thou with me
To whom then first incensed Adam replied
Is this the love is this the recompence
Of mine to thee ingrateful Eve expressed
Immutable when thou wert lost not I
Who might have lived and joyed immortal bliss
Yet willingly chose rather death with thee?
And am I now upbraided as the cause
Of thy transgressing?  Not enough severe
It seems in thy restraint  What could I more
I warned thee I admonished thee foretold
The danger and the lurking enemy
That lay in wait beyond this had been force
And force upon free will hath here no place
But confidence then bore thee on secure
Either to meet no danger or to find
Matter of glorious trial and perhaps
I also erred in overmuch admiring
What seemed in thee so perfect that I thought
No evil durst attempt thee but I rue
The errour now which is become my crime
And thou the accuser  Thus it shall befall
Him who to worth in women overtrusting
Lets her will rule restraint she will not brook
And left to herself if evil thence ensue
She first his weak indulgence will accuse
Thus they in mutual accusation spent
The fruitless hours but neither selfcondemning
And of their vain contest appeared no end



Book X


Mean while the heinous and despiteful act
Of Satan done in Paradise and how
He in the serpent had perverted Eve
Her husband she to taste the fatal fruit
Was known in Heaven for what can scape the eye
Of God allseeing or deceive his heart
Omniscient? who in all things wise and just
Hindered not Satan to attempt the mind
Of Man with strength entire and free will armed
Complete to have discovered and repulsed
Whatever wiles of foe or seeming friend
For still they knew and ought to have still remembered
The high injunction not to taste that fruit
Whoever tempted which they not obeying
Incurred what could they less? the penalty
And manifold in sin deserved to fall
Up into Heaven from Paradise in haste
The angelick guards ascended mute and sad
For Man for of his state by this they knew
Much wondering how the subtle Fiend had stolen
Entrance unseen  Soon as the unwelcome news
From Earth arrived at Heavengate displeased
All were who heard dim sadness did not spare
That time celestial visages yet mixed
With pity violated not their bliss
About the newarrived in multitudes
The ethereal people ran to hear and know
How all befel  They towards the throne supreme
Accountable made haste to make appear
With righteous plea their utmost vigilance
And easily approved when the Most High
Eternal Father from his secret cloud
Amidst in thunder uttered thus his voice
Assembled Angels and ye Powers returned
From unsuccessful charge be not dismayed
Nor troubled at these tidings from the earth
Which your sincerest care could not prevent
Foretold so lately what would come to pass
When first this tempter crossed the gulf from Hell
I told ye then he should prevail and speed
On his bad errand Man should be seduced
And flattered out of all believing lies
Against his Maker no decree of mine
Concurring to necessitate his fall
Or touch with lightest moment of impulse
His free will to her own inclining left
In even scale  But fallen he is and now
What rests but that the mortal sentence pass
On his transgressiondeath denounced that day?
Which he presumes already vain and void
Because not yet inflicted as he feared
By some immediate stroke but soon shall find
Forbearance no acquittance ere day end
Justice shall not return as bounty scorned
But whom send I to judge them? whom but thee
Vicegerent Son?  To thee I have transferred
All judgement whether in Heaven or Earth or Hell
Easy it may be seen that I intend
Mercy colleague with justice sending thee
Mans friend his Mediator his designed
Both ransom and Redeemer voluntary
And destined Man himself to judge Man fallen
So spake the Father and unfolding bright
Toward the right hand his glory on the Son
Blazed forth unclouded Deity He full
Resplendent all his Father manifest
Expressed and thus divinely answered mild
Father Eternal thine is to decree
Mine both in Heaven and Earth to do thy will
Supreme that thou in me thy Son beloved
Mayest ever rest well pleased  I go to judge
On earth these thy transgressours but thou knowest
Whoever judged the worst on me must light
When time shall be for so I undertook
Before thee and not repenting this obtain
Of right that I may mitigate their doom
On me derived yet I shall temper so
Justice with mercy as may illustrate most
Them fully satisfied and thee appease
Attendance none shall need nor train where none
Are to behold the judgement but the judged
Those two the third best absent is condemned
Convict by flight and rebel to all law
Conviction to the serpent none belongs
Thus saying from his radiant seat he rose
Of high collateral glory Him Thrones and Powers
Princedoms and Dominations ministrant
Accompanied to Heavengate from whence
Eden and all the coast in prospect lay
Down he descended straight the speed of Gods
Time counts not though with swiftest minutes winged
Now was the sun in western cadence low
From noon and gentle airs due at their hour
To fan the earth now waked and usher in
The evening cool when he from wrath more cool
Came the mild Judge and Intercessour both
To sentence Man  The voice of God they heard
Now walking in the garden by soft winds
Brought to their ears while day declined they heard
And from his presence hid themselves among
The thickest trees both man and wife till God
Approaching thus to Adam called aloud
Where art thou Adam wont with joy to meet
My coming seen far off?  I miss thee here
Not pleased thus entertained with solitude
Where obvious duty ere while appeared unsought
Or come I less conspicuous or what change
Absents thee or what chance detains?Come forth
He came and with him Eve more loth though first
To offend discountenanced both and discomposed
Love was not in their looks either to God
Or to each other but apparent guilt
And shame and perturbation and despair
Anger and obstinacy and hate and guile
Whence Adam faltering long thus answered brief
I heard thee in the garden and of thy voice
Afraid being naked hid myself  To whom
The gracious Judge without revile replied
My voice thou oft hast heard and hast not feared
But still rejoiced how is it now become
So dreadful to thee?  That thou art naked who
Hath told thee?  Hast thou eaten of the tree
Whereof I gave thee charge thou shouldst not eat?
To whom thus Adam sore beset replied
O Heaven in evil strait this day I stand
Before my Judge either to undergo
Myself the total crime or to accuse
My other self the partner of my life
Whose failing while her faith to me remains
I should conceal and not expose to blame
By my complaint but strict necessity
Subdues me and calamitous constraint
Lest on my head both sin and punishment
However insupportable be all
Devolved though should I hold my peace yet thou
Wouldst easily detect what I conceal
This Woman whom thou madest to be my help
And gavest me as thy perfect gift so good
So fit so acceptable so divine
That from her hand I could suspect no ill
And what she did whatever in itself
Her doing seemed to justify the deed
She gave me of the tree and I did eat
To whom the Sovran Presence thus replied
Was she thy God that her thou didst obey
Before his voice? or was she made thy guide
Superiour or but equal that to her
Thou didst resign thy manhood aUR HKE COTJI
