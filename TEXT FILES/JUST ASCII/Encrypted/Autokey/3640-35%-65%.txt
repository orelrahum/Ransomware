In Pontus or the Punick coast or where
Alcinous reigned fruit of all kinds in coat
Rough or smooth rind or bearded husk or shell
She gathers tribute large and on the board
Heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape
She crushes inoffensive must and meaths
From many a berry and from sweet kernels pressed
She tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold
Wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground
With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed
Mean while our primitive great sire to meet
His Godlike guest walks forth without more train
Accompanied than with his own complete
Perfections in himself was all his state
More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits
On princes when their rich retinue long
Of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold
Dazzles the croud and sets them all agape
Nearer his presence Adam though not awed
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek
As to a superiour nature bowing low
Thus said  Native of Heaven for other place
None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain
Since by descending from the thrones above
Those happy places thou hast deigned a while
To want and honour these vouchsafe with us
Two only who yet by sovran gift possess
This spacious ground in yonder shady bower
To rest and what the garden choicest bears
To sit and taste till this meridian heat
Be over and the sun more cool decline
Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild
Adam I therefore came nor art thou such
Created or such place hast here to dwell
As may not oft invite though Spirits of Heaven
To visit thee lead on then where thy bower
Oershades for these midhours till evening rise
I have at will  So to the sylvan lodge
They came that like Pomonas arbour smiled
With flowerets decked and fragrant smells but Eve
Undecked save with herself more lovely fair
Than WoodNymph or the fairest Goddess feigned
Of three that in mount Ida naked strove
Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven no veil
She needed virtueproof no thought infirm
Altered her cheek  On whom the Angel Hail
Bestowed the holy salutation used
Long after to blest Mary second Eve
Hail Mother of Mankind whose fruitful womb
Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons
Than with these various fruits the trees of God
Have heaped this tableRaised of grassy turf
Their table was and mossy seats had round
And on her ample square from side to side
All autumn piled though spring and autumn here
Danced hand in hand  A while discourse they hold
No fear lest dinner cool when thus began
Our author  Heavenly stranger please to taste
These bounties which our Nourisher from whom
All perfect good unmeasured out descends
To us for food and for delight hath caused
The earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps
To spiritual natures only this I know
That one celestial Father gives to all
To whom the Angel  Therefore what he gives
Whose praise be ever sung to Man in part
Spiritual may of purest Spirits be found
No ingrateful food  And food alike those pure
Intelligential substances require
As doth your rational and both contain
Within them every lower faculty
Of sense whereby they hear see smell touch taste
Tasting concoct digest assimilate
And corporeal to incorporeal turn
For know whatever was created needs
To be sustained and fed  Of elements
The grosser feeds the purer earth the sea
Earth and the sea feed air the air those fires
Ethereal and as lowest first the moon
Whence in her visage round those spots unpurged
Vapours not yet into her substance turned
Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale
From her moist continent to higher orbs
The sun that light imparts to all receives
From all his alimental recompence
In humid exhalations and at even
Sups with the ocean  Though in Heaven the trees
Of life ambrosial fruitage bear and vines
Yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn
We brush mellifluous dews and find the ground
Covered with pearly grain  Yet God hath here
Varied his bounty so with new delights
As may compare with Heaven and to taste
Think not I shall be nice  So down they sat
And to their viands fell nor seemingly
The Angel nor in mist the common gloss
Of Theologians but with keen dispatch
Of real hunger and concoctive heat
To transubstantiate  What redounds transpires
Through Spirits with ease nor wonderif by fire
Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist
Can turn or holds it possible to turn
Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold
As from the mine  Mean while at table Eve
Ministered naked and their flowing cups
With pleasant liquours crowned  O innocence
Deserving Paradise if ever then
Then had the sons of God excuse to have been
Enamoured at that sight but in those hearts
Love unlibidinous reigned nor jealousy
Was understood the injured lovers hell
Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed
Not burdened nature sudden mind arose
In Adam not to let the occasion pass
Given him by this great conference to know
Of things above his world and of their being
Who dwell in Heaven whose excellence he saw
Transcend his own so far whose radiant forms
Divine effulgence whose high power so far
Exceeded human and his wary speech
Thus to the empyreal minister he framed
Inhabitant with God now know I well
Thy favour in this honour done to Man
Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed
To enter and these earthly fruits to taste
Food not of Angels yet accepted so
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem
At Heavens high feasts to have fed yet what compare
To whom the winged Hierarch replied
O Adam One Almighty is from whom
All things proceed and up to him return
If not depraved from good created all
Such to perfection one first matter all
Endued with various forms various degrees
Of substance and in things that live of life
But more refined more spiritous and pure
As nearer to him placed or nearer tending
Each in their several active spheres assigned
Till body up to spirit work in bounds
Proportioned to each kind  So from the root
Springs lighter the green stalk from thence the leaves
More aery last the bright consummate flower
Spirits odorous breathes flowers and their fruit
Mans nourishment by gradual scale sublimed
To vital spirits aspire to animal
To intellectual give both life and sense
Fancy and understanding whence the soul
Reason receives and reason is her being
Discursive or intuitive discourse
Is oftest yours the latter most is ours
Differing but in degree of kind the same
Wonder not then what God for you saw good
If I refuse not but convert as you
To proper substance  Time may come when Men
With Angels may participate and find
No inconvenient diet nor too light fare
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps
Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit
Improved by tract of time and winged ascend
Ethereal as we or may at choice
Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell
If ye be found obedient and retain
Unalterably firm his love entire
Whose progeny you are  Mean while enjoy
Your fill what happiness this happy state
Can comprehend incapable of more
To whom the patriarch of mankind replied
O favourable Spirit propitious guest
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct
Our knowledge and the scale of nature set
From center to circumference whereon
In contemplation of created things
By steps we may ascend to God  But say
What meant that caution joined If ye be found
Obedient?  Can we want obedience then
To him or possibly his love desert
Who formed us from the dust and placed us here
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss
Human desires can seek or apprehend?
To whom the Angel  Son of Heaven and Earth
Attend  That thou art happy owe to God
That thou continuest such owe to thyself
That is to thy obedience therein stand
This was that caution given thee be advised
God made thee perfect not immutable
And good he made thee but to persevere
He left it in thy power ordained thy will
By nature free not overruled by fate
Inextricable or strict necessity
Our voluntary service he requires
Not our necessitated such with him
Finds no acceptance nor can find for how
Can hearts not free be tried whether they serve
Willing or no who will but what they must
By destiny and can no other choose?
Myself and all the angelick host that stand
In sight of God enthroned our happy state
Hold as you yours while our obedience holds
On other surety none  Freely we serve
Because we freely love as in our will
To love or not in this we stand or fall
And some are fallen to disobedience fallen
And so from Heaven to deepest Hell O fall
From what high state of bliss into what woe
To whom our great progenitor  Thy words
Attentive and with more delighted ear
Divine instructer I have heard than when
Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills
Aereal musick send  Nor knew I not
To be both will and deed created free
Yet that we never shall forget to love
Our Maker and obey him whose command
Single is yet so just my constant thoughts
Assured me and still assure  Though what thou tellest
Hath passed in Heaven some doubt within me move
But more desire to hear if thou consent
The full relation which must needs be strange
Worthy of sacred silence to be heard
And we have yet large day for scarce the sun
Hath finished half his journey and scarce begins
His other half in the great zone of Heaven
Thus Adam made request and Raphael
After short pause assenting thus began
High matter thou enjoinest me O prime of men
Sad task and hard  For how shall I relate
To human sense the invisible exploits
Of warring Spirits? how without remorse
The ruin of so many glorious once
And perfect while they stood? how last unfold
The secrets of another world perhaps
Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good
This is dispensed and what surmounts the reach
Of human sense I shall delineate so
By likening spiritual to corporal forms
As may express them best though what if Earth
Be but a shadow of Heaven and things therein
Each to other like more than on earth is thought?
As yet this world was not and Chaos wild
Reigned where these Heavens now roll where Earth now rests
Upon her center poised when on a day
For time though in eternity applied
To motion measures all things durable
By present past and future on such day
As Heavens great year brings forth the empyreal host
Of Angels by imperial summons called
Innumerable before the Almightys throne
Forthwith from all the ends of Heaven appeared
Under their Hierarchs in orders bright
Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced
Standards and gonfalons twixt van and rear
Stream in the air and for distinction serve
Of hierarchies of orders and degrees
Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed
Holy memorials acts of zeal and love
Recorded eminent  Thus when in orbs
Of circuit inexpressible they stood
Orb within orb the Father Infinite
By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son
Amidst as from a flaming mount whose top
Brightness had made invisible thus spake
Hear all ye Angels progeny of light
Thrones Dominations Princedoms Virtues Powers
Hear my decree which unrevoked shall stand
This day I have begot whom I declare
My only Son and on this holy hill
Him have anointed whom ye now behold
At my right hand your head I him appoint
And by myself have sworn to him shall bow
All knees in Heaven and shall confess him Lord
Under his great vicegerent reign abide
United as one individual soul
For ever happy  Him who disobeys
Me disobeys breaks union and that day
Cast out from God and blessed vision falls
Into utter darkness deep ingulfed his place
Ordained without redemption without end
So spake the Omnipotent and with his words
All seemed well pleased all seemed but were not all
That day as other solemn days they spent
In song and dance about the sacred hill
Mystical dance which yonder starry sphere
Of planets and of fixed in all her wheels
Resembles nearest mazes intricate
Eccentrick intervolved yet regular
Then most when most irregular they seem
And in their motions harmony divine
So smooths her charming tones that Gods own ear
Listens delighted  Evening now approached
For we have also our evening and our morn
We ours for change delectable not need
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
Desirous all in circles as they stood
Tables are set and on a sudden piled
With Angels food and rubied nectar flows
In pearl in diamond and massy gold
Fruit of delicious vines the growth of Heaven
On flowers reposed and with fresh flowerets crowned
They eat they drink and in communion sweet
Quaff immortality and joy secure
Of surfeit where full measure only bounds
Excess before the allbounteous King who showered
With copious hand rejoicing in their joy
Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled
From that high mount of God whence light and shade
Spring both the face of brightest Heaven had changed
To grateful twilight for night comes not there
In darker veil and roseat dews disposed
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest
Wide over all the plain and wider far
Than all this globous earth in plain outspread
Such are the courts of God the angelick throng
Dispersed in bands and files their camp extend
By living streams among the trees of life
Pavilions numberless and sudden reared
Celestial tabernacles where they slept
Fanned with cool winds save those who in their course
Melodious hymns about the sovran throne
Alternate all night long but not so waked
Satan so call him now his former name
Is heard no more in Heaven he of the first
If not the first ArchAngel great in power
In favour and preeminence yet fraught
With envy against the Son of God that day
Honoured by his great Father and proclaimed
Messiah King anointed could not bear
Through pride that sight and thought himself impaired
Deep malice thence conceiving and disdain
Soon as midnight brought on the dusky hour
Friendliest to sleep and silence he resolved
With all his legions to dislodge and leave
Unworshipt unobeyed the throne supreme
Contemptuous and his next subordinate
Awakening thus to him in secret spake
Sleepest thou Companion dear?  What sleep can close
Thy eyelids? and rememberest what decree
Of yesterday so late hath passed the lips
Of Heavens Almighty  Thou to me thy thoughts
Wast wont I mine to thee was wont to impart
Both waking we were one how then can now
Thy sleep dissent?  New laws thou seest imposed
New laws from him who reigns new minds may raise
In us who serve new counsels to debate
What doubtful may ensue  More in this place
To utter is not safe  Assemble thou
Of all those myriads which we lead the chief
Tell them that by command ere yet dim night
Her shadowy cloud withdraws I am to haste
And all who under me their banners wave
Homeward with flying march where we possess
The quarters of the north there to prepare
Fit entertainment to receive our King
The great Messiah and his new commands
Who speedily through all the hierarchies
Intends to pass triumphant and give laws
So spake the false ArchAngel and infused
Bad influence into the unwary breast
Of his associate  He together calls
Or several one by one the regent Powers
Under him Regent tells as he was taught
That the Most High commanding now ere night
Now ere dim night had disincumbered Heaven
The great hierarchal standard was to move
Tells the suggested cause and casts between
Ambiguous words and jealousies to sound
Or taint integrity  But all obeyed
The wonted signal and superiour voice
Of their great Potentate for great indeed
His name and high was his degree in Heaven
His countenance as the morningstar that guides
The starry flock allured them and with lies
Drew after him the third part of Heavens host
Mean while the Eternal eye whose sight discerns
Abstrusest thoughts from forth his holy mount
And from within the golden lamps that burn
Nightly before him saw without their light
Rebellion rising saw in whom how spread
Among the sons of morn what multitudes
Were banded to oppose his high decree
And smiling to his only Son thus said
Son thou in whom my glory I behold
In full resplendence Heir of all my might
Nearly it now concerns us to be sure
Of our Omnipotence and with what arms
We mean to hold what anciently we claim
Of deity or empire  Such a foe
Is rising who intends to erect his throne
Equal to ours throughout the spacious north
Nor so content hath in his thought to try
In battle what our power is or our right
Let us advise and to this hazard draw
With speed what force is left and all employ
In our defence lest unawares we lose
This our high place our sanctuary our hill
To whom the Son with calm aspect and clear
Lightning divine ineffable serene
Made answer  Mighty Father thou thy foes
Justly hast in derision and secure
Laughest at their vain designs and tumults vain
Matter to me of glory whom their hate
Illustrates when they see all regal power
Given me to quell their pride and in event
Know whether I be dextrous to subdue
Thy rebels or be found the worst in Heaven
So spake the Son but Satan with his Powers
Far was advanced on winged speed an host
Innumerable as the stars of night
Or stars of morning dewdrops which the sun
Impearls on every leaf and every flower
Regions they passed the mighty regencies
Of Seraphim and Potentates and Thrones
In their triple degrees regions to which
All thy dominion Adam is no more
Than what this garden is to all the earth
And all the sea from one entire globose
Stretched into longitude which having passed
At length into the limits of the north
They came and Satan to his royal seat
High on a hill far blazing as a mount
Raised on a mount with pyramids and towers
From diamond quarries hewn and rocks of gold
The palace of great Lucifer so call
That structure in the dialect of men
Interpreted which not long after he
Affecting all equality with God
In imitation of that mount whereon
Messiah was declared in sight of Heaven
The Mountain of the Congregation called
For thither he assembled all his train
Pretending so commanded to consult
About the great reception of their King
Thither to come and with calumnious art
Of counterfeited truth thus held their ears
Thrones Dominations Princedoms Virtues Powers
If these magnifick titles yet remain
Not merely titular since by decree
Another now hath to himself engrossed
All power and us eclipsed under the name
Of King anointed for whom all this haste
Of midnightmarch and hurried meeting here
This only to consult how we may best
With what may be devised of honours new
Receive him coming to receive from us
Kneetribute yet unpaid prostration vile
Too much to one but double how endured
To one and to his image now proclaimed?
But what if better counsels might erect
Our minds and teach us to cast off this yoke?
Will ye submit your necks and choose to bend
The supple knee?  Ye will not if I trust
To know ye right or if ye know yourselves
Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before
By none and if not equal all yet free
Equally free for orders and degrees
Jar not with liberty but well consist
Who can in reason then or right assume
Monarchy over such as live by right
His equals if in power and splendour less
In freedom equal? or can introduce
Law and edict on us who without law
Err not? much less for this to be our Lord
And look for adoration to the abuse
Of those imperial titles which assert
Our being ordained to govern not to serve
Thus far his bold discourse without controul
Had audience when among the Seraphim
Abdiel than whom none with more zeal adored
The Deity and divine commands obeyed
Stood up and in a flame of zeal severe
The current of his fury thus opposed
O argument blasphemous false and proud
Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven
Expected least of all from thee  Ingrate
In place thyself so high above thy peers
Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn
The just decree of God pronounced and sworn
That to his only Son by right endued
With regal scepter every soul in Heaven
Shall bend the knee and in that honour due
Confess him rightful King? unjust thou sayest
Flatly unjust to bind with laws the free
And equal over equals to let reign
One over all with unsucceeded power
Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute
With him the points of liberty who made
Thee what thou art and formed the Powers of Heaven
Such as he pleased and circumscribed their being?
Yet by experience taught we know how good
And of our good and of our dignity
How provident he is how far from thought
To make us less bent rather to exalt
Our happy state under one head more near
United  But to grant it thee unjust
That equal over equals monarch reign
Thyself though great and glorious dost thou count
Or all angelick nature joined in one
Equal to him begotten Son? by whom
As by his Word the Mighty Father made
All things even thee and all the Spirits of Heaven
By him created in their bright degrees
Crowned them with glory and to their glory named
Thrones Dominations Princedoms Virtues Powers
Essential Powers nor by his reign obscured
But more illustrious made since he the head
One of our number thus reduced becomes
His laws our laws all honour to him done
Returns our own  Cease then this impious rage
And tempt not these but hasten to appease
The incensed Father and the incensed Son
While pardon may be found in time besought
So spake the fervent Angel but his zeal
None seconded as out of season judged
Or singular and rash  Whereat rejoiced
The Apostate and more haughty thus replied
That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work
Of secondary hands by task transferred
From Father to his Son? strange point and new
Doctrine which we would know whence learned who saw
When this creation was? rememberest thou
Thy making while the Maker gave thee being?
We know no time when we were not as now
Know none before us selfbegot selfraised
By our own quickening power when fatal course
Had circled his full orb the birth mature
Of this our native Heaven ethereal sons
Our puissance is our own our own right hand
Shall teach us highest deeds by proof to try
Who is our equal  Then thou shalt behold
Whether by supplication we intend
Address and to begirt the almighty throne
Beseeching or besieging  This report
These tidings carry to the anointed King
And fly ere evil intercept thy flight
He said and as the sound of waters deep
Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause
Through the infinite host nor less for that
The flaming Seraph fearless though alone
Encompassed round with foes thus answered bold
O alienate from God O Spirit accursed
Forsaken of all good  I see thy fall
Determined and thy hapless crew involved
In this perfidious fraud contagion spread
Both of thy crime and punishment  Henceforth
No more be troubled how to quit the yoke
Of Gods Messiah those indulgent laws
Will not be now vouchsafed other decrees
Against thee are gone forth without recall
That golden scepter which thou didst reject
Is now an iron rod to bruise and break
Thy disobedience  Well thou didst advise
Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly
These wicked tents devoted lest the wrath
Impendent raging into sudden flame
Distinguish not  For soon expect to feel
His thunder on thy head devouring fire
Then who created thee lamenting learn
When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know
So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found
Among the faithless faithful only he
Among innumerable false unmoved
Unshaken unseduced unterrified
His loyalty he kept his love his zeal
Nor number nor example with him wrought
To swerve from truth or change his constant mind
Though single  From amidst them forth he passed
Long way through hostile scorn which he sustained
Superiour nor of violence feared aught
And with retorted scorn his back he turned
On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed



Book VI


All night the dreadless Angel unpursued
Through Heavens wide champain held his way till Morn
Waked by the circling Hours with rosy hand
Unbarred the gates of light  There is a cave
Within the mount of God fast by his throne
Where light and darkness in perpetual round
Lodge and dislodge by turns which makes through Heaven
Grateful vicissitude like day and night
Light issues forth and at the other door
Obsequious darkness enters till her hour
To veil the Heaven though darkness there might well
Seem twilight here  And now went forth the Morn
Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold
Empyreal from before her vanished Night
Shot through with orient beams when all the plain
Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright
Chariots and flaming arms and fiery steeds
Reflecting blaze on blaze first met his view
War he perceived war in procinct and found
Already known what he for news had thought
