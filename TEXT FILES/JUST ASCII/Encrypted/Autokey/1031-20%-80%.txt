Iceland Economy

Overview
    Icelands prosperous Scandinaviantype economy is basically capitalistic
    but with extensive welfare measures low unemployment and comparatively
    even distribution of income The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry which provides nearly  of export earnings In the absence of
    other natural resources Icelands economy is vulnerable to changing world
    fish prices The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
    in  and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
    plant The conservative governments economic priorities include reducing
    the budget and current account deficits containing inflation revising
    agricultural and fishing policies diversifying the economy and tying the
    krona to the ECs European currency unit in  The fishing industries 
    notably the shrimp industry  are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
    mergers Inflation has continued to drop sharply from  in  to about
     in  and possibly  in  while unemployment is expected to
    increase to  GDP is expected to contract by nearly  in
