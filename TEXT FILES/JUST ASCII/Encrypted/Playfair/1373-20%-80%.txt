ACT I



SCENE I	Orchard of Olivers house


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

ORLANDO	As I remember Adam it was upon this fashion
	bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns
	and as thou sayest charged my brother on his
	blessing to breed me well and there begins my
	sadness My brother Jaques he keeps at school and
	report speaks goldenly of his profit for my part
	he keeps me rustically at home or to speak more
	properly stays me here at home unkept for call you
	that keeping for a gentleman of my birth that
	differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
	are bred better for besides that they are fair
	with their feeding they are taught their manage
	and to that end riders dearly hired but I his
	brother gain nothing under him but growth for the
	which his animals on his dunghills are as much
	bound to him as I Besides this nothing that he so
	plentifully gives me the something that nature gave
	me his countenance seems to take from me he lets
	me feed with his hinds bars me the place of a
	brother and as much as in him lies mines my
	gentility with my education This is it Adam that
	grieves me and the spirit of my father which I
	think is within me begins to mutiny against this
	servitude I will no longer endure it though yet I
	know no wise remedy how to avoid it

ADAM	Yonder comes my master your brother

ORLANDO	Go apart Adam and thou shalt hear how he will
	shake me up

	Enter OLIVER

OLIVER	Now sir what make you here?

ORLANDO	Nothing I am not taught to make any thing

OLIVER	What mar you then sir?

ORLANDO	Marry sir I am helping you to mar that which God
	made a poor unworthy brother of yours with idleness

OLIVER	Marry sir be better employed and be naught awhile

ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
	What prodigal portion have I spent that I should
	come to such penury?

OLIVER	Know you where your are sir?

ORLANDO	O sir very well here in your orchard

OLIVER	Know you before whom sir?

ORLANDO	Ay better than him I am before knows me I know
	you are my eldest brother and in the gentle
	condition of blood you should so know me The
	courtesy of nations allows you my better in that
	you are the firstborn but the same tradition
	takes not away my blood were there twenty brothers
	betwixt us I have as much of my father in me as
	you albeit I confess your coming before me is
	nearer to his reverence

OLIVER	What boy

ORLANDO	Come come elder brother you are too young in this

OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me villain?

ORLANDO	I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir
	Rowland de Boys he was my father and he is thrice
	a villain that says such a father begot villains
	Wert thou not my brother I would not take this hand
	from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
	tongue for saying so thou hast railed on thyself

ADAM	Sweet masters be patient for your fathers
	remembrance be at accord

OLIVER	Let me go I say

ORLANDO	I will not till I please you shall hear me My
	father charged you in his will to give me good
	education you have trained me like a peasant
	obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike
	qualities The spirit of my father grows strong in
	me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow
	me such exercises as may become a gentleman or
	give me the poor allottery my father left me by
	testament with that I will go buy my fortunes

OLIVER	And what wilt thou do? beg when that is spent?
	Well sir get you in I will not long be troubled
	with you you shall have some part of your will I
	pray you leave me

ORLANDO	I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good

OLIVER	Get you with him you old dog

ADAM	Is old dog my reward? Most true I have lost my
	teeth in your service God be with my old master
	he would not have spoke such a word

	Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM

OLIVER	Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
	physic your rankness and yet give no thousand
	crowns neither Holla Dennis

	Enter DENNIS

DENNIS	Calls your worship?

OLIVER	Was not Charles the dukes wrestler here to speak with me?

DENNIS	So please you he is here at the door and importunes
	access to you

OLIVER	Call him in

	Exit DENNIS

	Twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is

	Enter CHARLES

CHARLES	Good morrow to your worship

OLIVER	Good Monsieur Charles whats the new news at the
	new court?

CHARLES	Theres no news at the court sir but the old news
	that is the old duke is banished by his younger
	brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
	have put themselves into voluntary exile with him
	whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
	therefore he gives them good leave to wander

OLIVER	Can you tell if Rosalind the dukes daughter be
	banished with her father?

CHARLES	O no for the dukes daughter her cousin so loves
	her being ever from their cradles bred together
	that she would have followed her exile or have died
	to stay behind her She is at the court and no
	less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
	never two ladies loved as they do

OLIVER	Where will the old duke live?

CHARLES	They say he is already in the forest of Arden and
	a many merry men with him and there they live like
	the old Robin Hood of England they say many young
	gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time
	carelessly as they did in the golden world

OLIVER	What you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?

CHARLES	Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a
	matter I am given sir secretly to understand
	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
	to come in disguised against me to try a fall
	Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that
	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
	well Your brother is but young and tender and
	for your love I would be loath to foil him as I
	must for my own honour if he come in therefore
	out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you
	withal that either you might stay him from his
	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
	run into in that it is a thing of his own search
	and altogether against my will

OLIVER	Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which
	thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had
	myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and
	have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
	it but he is resolute Ill tell thee Charles
	it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full
	of ambition an envious emulator of every mans
	good parts a secret and villanous contriver against
	me his natural brother therefore use thy
	discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck
	as his finger And thou wert best look tot for if
	thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
	mightily grace himself on thee he will practise
	against thee by poison entrap thee by some
	treacherous device and never leave thee till he
	hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other
	for I assure thee and almost with tears I speak
	it there is not one so young and so villanous this
	day living I speak but brotherly of him but
	should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must
	blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder

CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come
	tomorrow Ill give him his payment if ever he go
	alone again Ill never wrestle for prize more and
	so God keep your worship

OLIVER	Farewell good Charles

	Exit CHARLES

	Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see
	an end of him for my soul yet I know not why
	hates nothing more than he Yet hes gentle never
	schooled and yet learned full of noble device of
	all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much
	in the heart of the world and especially of my own
	people who best know him that I am altogether
	misprised but it shall not be so long this
	wrestler shall clear all nothing remains but that
	I kindle the boy thither which now Ill go about

	Exit

SCENE II	Lawn before the Dukes palace


	Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

CELIA	I pray thee Rosalind sweet my coz be merry

ROSALIND	Dear Celia I show more mirth than I am mistress of
	and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
	teach me to forget a banished father you must not
	learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure

CELIA	Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
	that I love thee If my uncle thy banished father
	had banished thy uncle the duke my father so thou
	hadst been still with me I could have taught my
	love to take thy father for mine so wouldst thou
	if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
	tempered as mine is to thee

ROSALIND	Well I will forget the condition of my estate to
	rejoice in yours

CELIA	You know my father hath no child but I nor none is
	like to have and truly when he dies thou shalt
	be his heir for what he hath taken away from thy
	father perforce I will render thee again in
	affection by mine honour I will and when I break
	that oath let me turn monster therefore my
	sweet Rose my dear Rose be merry

ROSALIND	From henceforth I will coz and devise sports Let
	me see what think you of falling in love?

CELIA	Marry I prithee do to make sport withal but
	love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport
	neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
	in honour come off again

ROSALIND	What shall be our sport then?

CELIA	Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
	her wheel that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally

ROSALIND	I would we could do so for her benefits are
	mightily misplaced and the bountiful blind woman
	doth most mistake in her gifts to women

CELIA	Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce
	makes honest and those that she makes honest she
	makes very illfavouredly

ROSALIND	Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to
	Natures Fortune reigns in gifts of the world
	not in the lineaments of Nature

	Enter TOUCHSTONE

CELIA	No? when Nature hath made a fair creature may she
	not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
	hath given us wit to flout at Fortune hath not
	Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?

ROSALIND	Indeed there is Fortune too hard for Nature when
	Fortune makes Natures natural the cutteroff of
	Natures wit

CELIA	Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither but
	Natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
	to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
	natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of
	the fool is the whetstone of the wits How now
	wit whither wander you?

TOUCHSTONE	Mistress you must come away to your father

CELIA	Were you made the messenger?

TOUCHSTONE	No by mine honour but I was bid to come for you

ROSALIND	Where learned you that oath fool?

TOUCHSTONE	Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
	were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
	mustard was naught now Ill stand to it the
	pancakes were naught and the mustard was good and
	yet was not the knight forsworn

CELIA	How prove you that in the great heap of your
	knowledge?

ROSALIND	Ay marry now unmuzzle your wisdom

TOUCHSTONE	Stand you both forth now stroke your chins and
	swear by your beards that I am a knave

CELIA	By our beards if we had them thou art

TOUCHSTONE	By my knavery if I had it then I were but if you
	swear by that that is not you are not forsworn no
	more was this knight swearing by his honour for he
	never had any or if he had he had sworn it away
	before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard

CELIA	Prithee who ist that thou meanest?

TOUCHSTONE	One that old Frederick your father loves

CELIA	My fathers love is enough to honour him enough
	speak no more of him youll be whipped for taxation
	one of these days

TOUCHSTONE	The more pity that fools may not speak wisely what
	wise men do foolishly

CELIA	By my troth thou sayest true for since the little
	wit that fools have was silenced the little foolery
	that wise men have makes a great show Here comes
	Monsieur Le Beau

ROSALIND	With his mouth full of news

CELIA	Which he will put on us as pigeons feed their young

ROSALIND	Then shall we be newscrammed

CELIA	All the better we shall be the more marketable

	Enter LE BEAU

	Bon jour Monsieur Le Beau whats the news?

LE BEAU	Fair princess you have lost much good sport

CELIA	Sport of what colour?

LE BEAU	What colour madam how shall I answer you?

ROSALIND	As wit and fortune will

TOUCHSTONE	Or as the Destinies decree

CELIA	Well said that was laid on with a trowel

TOUCHSTONE	Nay if I keep not my rank

ROSALIND	Thou losest thy old smell

LE BEAU	You amaze me ladies I would have told you of good
	wrestling which you have lost the sight of

ROSALIND	You tell us the manner of the wrestling

LE BEAU	I will tell you the beginning and if it please
	your ladyships you may see the end for the best is
	yet to do and here where you are they are coming
	to perform it

CELIA	Well the beginning that is dead and buried

LE BEAU	There comes an old man and his three sons

CELIA	I could match this beginLUDZ DMGU EW UVN FQSA
