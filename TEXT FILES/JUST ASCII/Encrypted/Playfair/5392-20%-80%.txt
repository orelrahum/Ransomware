get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall
and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was
just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something
of the sort

  Next came an angry voicethe RabbitsPat Pat  Where are
you?  And then a voice she had never heard before Sure then
Im here  Digging for apples yer honour

  Digging for apples indeed said the Rabbit angrily  Here
Come and help me out of THIS  Sounds of more broken glass

  Now tell me Pat whats that in the window?

  Sure its an arm yer honour  He pronounced it arrum

  An arm you goose   Who ever saw one that size?  Why it
fills the whole window

  Sure it does yer honour  but its an arm for all that

  Well its got no business there at any rate  go and take it
away

  There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then such as Sure I dont like it yer
honour at all at all  Do as I tell you you coward and at
last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in
the air  This time there were TWO little shrieks and more
sounds of broken glass  What a number of cucumberframes there
must be thought Alice  I wonder what theyll do next  As for
pulling me out of the window I only wish they COULD  Im sure I
dont want to stay in here any longer

  She waited for some time without hearing anything more  at
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a
good many voice all talking together  she made out the words
Wheres the other ladder?Why I hadnt to bring but one
Bills got the otherBill fetch it here ladHere put em up
at this cornerNo tie em together firstthey dont reach half
high enough yetOh theyll do well enough dont be particular
Here Bill catch hold of this ropeWill the roof bear?Mind
that loose slateOh its coming down  Heads below a loud
crashNow who did that?It was Bill I fancyWhos to go
down the chimney?Nay I shant YOU do itThat I wont
thenBills to go downHere Bill the master says youre to
go down the chimney

  Oh So Bills got to come down the chimney has he? said
Alice to herself  Shy they seem to put everything upon Bill
I wouldnt be in Bills place for a good deal  this fireplace is
narrow to be sure but I THINK I can kick a little

  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and
waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what
sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above her  then saying to herself This is Bill she gave one
sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next

  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes
Bill then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him you by the
hedge then silence and then another confusion of voicesHold
up his headBrandy nowDont choke himHow was it old fellow?
What happened to you?  Tell us all about it

  Last came a little feeble squeaking voice Thats Bill
thought Alice Well I hardly knowNo more thank ye Im
better nowbut Im a deal too flustered to tell youall I know
is something comes at me like a Jackinthebox and up I goes
like a skyrocket

  So you did old fellow said the others

  We must burn the house down said the Rabbits voice and
Alice called out as loud as she could If you do  Ill set
Dinah at you

  There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to
herself I wonder what they WILL do next  If they had any
sense theyd take the roof off  After a minute or two they
began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say A
barrowful will do to begin with

  A barrowful of WHAT? thought Alice but she had not long to
doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face
Ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out
Youd better not do that again which produced another dead
silence

  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright
idea came into her head  If I eat one of these cakes she
thought its sure to make SOME change in my size and as it
cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I
suppose

  So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find
that she began shrinking directly  As soon as she was small
enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and
found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
The poor little Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by
two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she
ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a
thick wood

  The first thing Ive got to do said Alice to herself as she
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
I think that will be the best plan

  It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and
simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the
smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering
about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over
her head made her look up in a great hurry

  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her
Poor little thing said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried
hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the
time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it
would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing

  Hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of
stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped
into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight
and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then Alice
dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run
over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy
made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very
like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle
again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long
way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat
down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its
mouth and its great eyes half shut

  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape
so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out
of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the
distance

  And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she
leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself
with one of the leaves  I should have liked teaching it tricks
very much ifif Id only been the right size to do it  Oh
dear  Id nearly forgotten that Ive got to grow up again  Let
me seehow IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or
drink something or other but the great question is what?

  The great question certainly was what?  Alice looked all round
her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
the circumstances  There was a large mushroom growing near her
about the same height as herself and when she had looked under
it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it

  She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of
the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large
caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded
quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of anything else



                            CHAPTER V

                    Advice from a Caterpillar


  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice

  Who are YOU? said the Caterpillar

  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  Alice
replied rather shyly II hardly know sir just at present
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning but I think
I must have been changed several times since then

  What do you mean by that? said the Caterpillar sternly
Explain yourself

  I cant explain MYSELF Im afraid sir said Alice because
Im not myself you see

  I dont see said the Caterpillar

  Im afraid I cant put it more clearly Alice replied very
politely for I cant understand it myself to begin with and
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing

  It isnt said the Caterpillar

  Well perhaps you havent found it so yet said Alice but
when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you
knowand then after that into a butterfly I should think youll
feel it a little queer wont you?

  Not a bit said the Caterpillar

  Well perhaps your feelings may be different said Alice
all I know is it would feel very queer to ME

  You said the Caterpillar contemptuously  Who are YOU?

  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars
making such VERY short remarks and she drew herself up and said
very gravely I think you ought to tell me who YOU are first

  Why? said the Caterpillar

  Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not
think of any good reason and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
a VERY unpleasant state of mind she turned away

  Come back the Caterpillar called after her  Ive something
important to say

  This sounded promising certainly  Alice turned and came back
again

  Keep your temper said the Caterpillar

  Is that all? said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as
she could

  No said the Caterpillar

  Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else
to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
hearing  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking but
at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth
again and said So you think youre changed do you?

  Im afraid I am sir said Alice I cant remember things as
I usedand I dont keep the same size for ten minutes together

  Cant remember WHAT things? said the Caterpillar

  Well Ive tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE" but it
all came different Alice replied in a very melancholy voice

  Repeat "YOU ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM" said the Caterpillar

  Alice folded her hands and began

    You are old Father William the young man said
      And your hair has become very white
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head
      Do you think at your age it is right?

    In my youth Father William replied to his son
      I feared it might injure the brain
    But now that Im perfectly sure I have none
      Why I do it again and again

    You are old said the youth as I mentioned before
      And have grown most uncommonly fat
    Yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door
      Pray what is the reason of that?

    In my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks
      I kept all my limbs very supple
    By the use of this ointmentone shilling the box
      Allow me to sell you a couple?

    You are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak
      For anything tougher than suet
    Yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak
      Pray how did you manage to do it?

    In my youth said his father I took to the law
      And argued each case with my wife
    And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw
      Has lasted the rest of my life

    You are old said the youth one would hardly suppose
      That your eye was as steady as ever
    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
      What made you so awfully clever?

    I have answered three questions and that is enough
      Said his father dont give yourself airs
    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
      Be off or Ill kick you down stairs


  That is not said right said the Caterpillar

  Not QUITE right Im afraid said Alice timidly some of the
words have got altered

  It is wrong from beginning to end said the Caterpillar
decidedly and there was silence for some minutes

  The Caterpillar was the first to speak

  What size do you want to be? it asked

  Oh Im not particular as to size Alice hastily replied
only one doesnt like changing so often you know

  I DONT know said the Caterpillar

  Alice said nothing  she had never been so much contradicted in
her life before and she felt that she was losing her temper

  Are you content now? said the Caterpillar

  Well I should like to be a LITTLE larger sir if you
wouldnt mind said Alice  three inches is such a wretched
height to be

  It is a very good height indeed said the Caterpillar
angrily rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three
inches high

  But Im not used to it pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone
And she thought of herself I wish the creatures wouldnt be so
easily offended

  Youll get used to it in time said the Caterpillar and it
put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again

  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and yawned once or twice and shook itself  Then it got
down off the mushroom and crawled away in the grass merely
remarking as it went One side will make you grow taller and
the other side will make you grow shorter

  One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT? thought Alice to
herself

  Of the mushroom said the Caterpillar just as if she had
asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight

  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a
minute trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as
it was perfectly round she found this a very difficult question
However at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they
would go and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand

  And now which is which? she said to herself and nibbled a
little of the righthand bit to try the effect  the next moment
she felt a violent blow underneath her chin  it had struck her
foot

  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change but
she felt that there was no time to be lost as she was shrinking
rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot that there was
hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last and
managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit


                                               

                                            

                                               

  Come my heads free at last said Alice in a tone of
delight which changed into alarm in another moment when she
found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found  all she could
see when she looked down was an immense length of neck which
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
far below her

  What CAN all that green stuff be? said Alice  And where
HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh my poor hands how is it I
cant see you?  She was moving them about as she spoke but no
result seemed to follow except a little shaking among the
distant green leaves

  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her
head she tried to get her head down to them and was delighted
to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction
like a serpent  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a
graceful zigzag and was going to dive in among the leaves which
she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she
had been wandering when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
hurry  a large pigeon had flown into her face and was beating
her violently with its wings

  Serpent screamed the Pigeon

  Im NOT a serpent said Alice indignantly  Let me alone

  Serpent I say again repeated the Pigeon but in a more
subdued tone and added with a kind of sob Ive tried every
way and nothing seems to suit them

  I havent the least idea what youre talking about said
Alice

  Ive tried the roots of trees and Ive tried banks and Ive
tried hedges the Pigeon went on without attending to her but
those serpents  Theres no pleasing them

  Alice was more and more puzzled but she thought there was no
use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished

  As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs said the
Pigeon but I must be on the lookout for serpents night and
day  Why I havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks

  Im very sorry youve been annoyed said Alice who was
beginning to see its meaning

  And just as Id taken the highest tree in the wood continued
the Pigeon raising its voice to a shriek and just as I was
thinking I should be free of them at last they must needs come
wriggling down from the sky  Ugh Serpent

  But Im NOT a serpent I tell you said Alice  Im aIm
a

  Well  WHAT are you? said the Pigeon  I can see youre
trying to invent something

  IIm a little girl said Alice rather doubtfully as she
remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day

  A likely story indeed said the Pigeon in a tone of the
deepest contempt  Ive seen a good many little girls in my
time but never ONE with such a neck as that  No no  Youre a
serpent and theres no use denying it  I suppose youll be
telling me next that you never tasted an egg

  I HAVE tasted eggs certainly said Alice who was a very
truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as
serpents do you know

  I dont believe it said the Pigeon but if they do why
then theyre a kind of serpent thats all I can say

  This was such a new idea to Alice that she was quite silent
for a minute or two which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of
adding Youre looking for eggs I know THAT well enough and
what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl or a
serpent?

  It matters a good deal to ME said Alice hastily but Im
not looking for eggs as it happens and if I was I shouldnt
want YOURS  I dont like them raw

  Well be off then said the Pigeon in a sulky tone as it
settled down again into its nest  Alice crouched down among the
trees as well as she could for her neck kept getting entangled
among the branches and every now and then she had to stop and
untwist it  After a while she remembered that she still held the
pieces of mushroom in her hands and she set to work very
carefully nibbling first at one and then at the other and
growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height

  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size
that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a
few minutes and began talking to herself as usual  Come
theres half my plan done now  How puzzling all these changes
are  Im never sure what Im going to be from one minute to
another  However Ive got back to my right size  the next
thing is to get into that beautiful gardenhow IS that to be
done I wonder?  As she said this she came suddenly upon an
open place with a little house in it about four feet high
Whoever lives there thought Alice itll never do to come
upon them THIS size  why I should frighten them out of their
wits  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again and did
not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself
down to nine inches high



                           CHAPTER VI

                         Pig and Pepper


  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house and
wondering what to do next when suddenly a footman in livery came
running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman
because he was in livery  otherwise judging by his face only
she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door
with his knuckles  It was opened by another footman in livery
with a round face and large eyes like a frog and both footmen
Alice noticed had powdered hair that curled all over their
heads  She felt very curious to know what it was all about and
crept a little way out of the wood to listen

  The FishFootman began by producing from under his arm a great
letter nearly as large as himself and this he handed over to
the other saying in a solemn tone For the Duchess  An
invitation from the Queen to play croquet  The FrogFootman
repeated in the same solemn tone only changing the order of the
words a little From the Queen  An invitation for the Duchess
to play croquet

  Then they both bowed low and their curls got entangled
together

  Alice laughed so much at this that she had to run back into
the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped
out the FishFootman was gone and the other was sitting on the
ground near the door staring stupidly up into the sky

  Alice went timidly up to the door and knocked

  Theres no sort of use in knocking said the Footman and
that for two reasons  First because Im on the same side of the
door as you are secondly because theyre making such a noise
inside no one could possibly hear you  And certainly there was
a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling
and sneezing and every now and then a great crash as if a dish
or kettle had been broken to pieces

  Please then said Alice how am I to get in?

  There might be some sense in your knocking the Footman went
on without attending to her if we had the door between us  For
instance if you were INSIDE you might knock and I could let
you out you know  He was looking up into the sky all the time
he was speaking and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil  But
perhaps he cant help it she said to herself his eyes are so
VERY nearly at the top of his head  But at any rate he might
answer questionsHow am I to get in? she repeated aloud

  I shall sit here the Footman remarked till tomorrow

  At this moment the door of the house opened and a large plate
came skimming out straight at the Footmans head  it just
grazed his nose and broke to pieces against one of the trees
behind him

  or next day maybe the Footman continued in the same tone
exactly as if nothing had happened

  How am I to get in? asked Alice again in a louder tone

  ARE you to get in at all? said the Footman  Thats the
first question you know

  It was no doubt  only Alice did not like to be told so
Its really dreadful she muttered to herself the way all the
creatures argue  Its enough to drive one crazy

  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for
repeating his remark with variations  I shall sit here he
said on and off for days and days

  But what am I to do? said Alice

  Anything you like said the Footman and began whistling

  Oh theres no use in talking to him said Alice desperately
hes perfectly idiotic  And she opened the door and went in

  The door led right into a large kitchen which was full of
smoke from one end to the other  the Duchess was sitting on a
threelegged stool in the middle nursing a baby the cook was
leaning over the fire stirring a large cauldron which seemed to
be full of soup

  Theres certainly too much pepper in that soup Alice said to
herself as well as she could for sneezing

  There was certainly too much of it in the air  Even the
Duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby it was
sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause  The
only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze were the cook
and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from
ear to ear

  Please would you tell me said Alice a little timidly for
she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to
speak first why your cat grins like that?

  Its a Cheshire cat said the Duchess and thats why
Pig

  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice
quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed
to the baby and not to her so she took courage and went on
again

  I didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact I
didnt know that cats COULD grin

  They all can said the Duchess and most of em do

  I dont know of any that do Alice said very politely
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation

  You dont know much said the Duchess and thats a fact

  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark and thought
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of
conversation  While she was trying to fix on one the cook took
the cauldron of soup off the fire and at once set to work
throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby
the fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans
plates and dishes  The Duchess took no notice of them even when
they hit her and the baby was howling so much already that it
was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not

  Oh PLEASE mind what youre doing cried Alice jumping up
and down in an agony of terror  Oh there goes his PRECIOUS
nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it and very
nearly carried it off

  If everybody minded their own business the Duchess said in a
hoarse growl the world would go round a deal faster than it
does

  Which would NOT be an advantage said Alice who felt very
glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her
knowledge  Just think of what work it would make with the day
and night  You see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn
round on its axis

  Talking of axes said the Duchess chop off her head

  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook to see if she meant
to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup and
seemed not to be listening so she went on again  Twentyfour
hours I THINK or is it twelve?  I

  Oh dont bother ME said the Duchess I never could abide
figures  And with that she began nursing her child again
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so and giving it a
violent shake at the end of every line

        Speak roughly to your little boy
          And beat him when he sneezes
        He only does it to annoy
          Because he knows it teases

                    CHORUS

    In which the cook and the baby joined

                Wow wow wow

  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song she kept
tossing the baby violently up and down and the poor little thing
howled so that Alice could hardly hear the words

        I speak severely to my boy
          I beat him when he sneezes
        For he can thoroughly enjoy
          The pepper when he pleases

                    CHORUS

                Wow wow wow

  Here you may nurse it a bit if you like the Duchess said
to Alice flinging the baby at her as she spoke  I must go and
get ready to play croquet with the Queen and she hurried out of
the room  The cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out
but it just missed her

  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty as it was a queer
shaped little creature and held out its arms and legs in all
directions just like a starfish thought Alice  The poor
little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again
so that altogether for the first minute or two it was as much
as she could do to hold it

  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it
which was to twist it up into a sort of knot and then keep
tight hold of its right ear and left foot so as to prevent its
undoing itself she carried it out into the open air  IF I
dont take this child away with me thought Alice theyre sure
to kill it in a day or two  wouldnt it be murder to leave it
behind?  She said the last words out loud and the little thing
grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time  Dont
grunt said Alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself

  The baby grunted again and Alice looked very anxiously into
its face to see what was the matter with it  There could be no
doubt that it had a VERY turnup nose much more like a snout
than a real nose also its eyes were getting extremely small for
a baby  altogether Alice did not like the look of the thing at
all  But perhaps it was only sobbing she thought and looked
into its eyes again to see if there were any tears

  No there were no tears  If youre going to turn into a pig
my dear said Alice seriously Ill have nothing more to do
with you  Mind now  The poor little thing sobbed again or
grunted it was impossible to say which and they went on for
some while in silence

  Alice was just beginning to think to herself Now what am I
to do with this creature when I get it home? when it grunted
again so violently that she looked down into its face in some
alarm  This time there could be NO mistake about it  it was
neither more nor less than a pig and she felt that it would be
quite absurd for her to carry it further

  So she set the little creature down and felt quite relieved to
see it trot away quietly into the wood  If it had grown up
she said to herself it would have made a dreadfully ugly child
but it makes rather a handsome pig I think  And she began
thinking over other children she knew who might do very well as
pigs and was just saying to herself if one only knew the right
way to change them when she was a little startled by seeing
the Cheshire Cat sitting on a bough of a tree a few yards off

  The Cat only grinned when it saw Alice  It looked good
natured she thought  still it had VERY long claws and a great
many teeth so she felt that it ought to be treated with respect

  Cheshire Puss she began rather timidly as she did not at
all know whether it would like the name  however it only
grinned a little wider  Come its pleased so far thought
Alice and she went on  Would you tell me please which way I
ought to go from here?

  That depends a good deal on where you want to get to said
the Cat

  I dont much care where said Alice

  Then it doesnt matter which way you go said the Cat

  so long as I get SOMEWHERE Alice added as an explanation

  Oh youre sure to do that said the Cat if you only walk
long enough

  Alice felt that this could not be denied so she tried another
question  What sort of people live about here?

  In THAT direction the Cat said waving its right paw round
lives a Hatter  and in THAT direction waving the other paw
lives a March Hare  Visit either you like  theyre both mad

  But I dont want to go among mad people Alice remarked

  Oh you cant help that said the Cat  were all mad here
Im mad  Youre mad

  How do you know Im mad? said Alice

  You must be said the Cat or you wouldnt have come here

  Alice didnt think that proved it at all however she went on
And how do you know that youre mad?

  To begin with said the Cat a dogs not mad  You grant
that?

  I suppose so said Alice

  Well then the Cat went on you see a dog growls when its
angry and wags its tail when its pleased  Now I growl when Im
pleased and wag my tail when Im angry  Therefore Im mad

  I call it purring not growling said Alice

  Call it what you like said the Cat  Do you play croquet
with the Queen today?

  I should like it very much said Alice but I havent been
invited yet

  Youll see me there said the Cat and vanished

  Alice was not much surprised at this she was getting so used
to queer things happening  While she was looking at the place
where it had been it suddenly appeared again

  Bythebye what became of the baby? said the Cat  Id
nearly forgotten to ask

  It turned into a pig Alice quietly said just as if it had
come back in a natural way

  I thought it would said the Cat and vanished again

  Alice waited a little half expecting to see it again but it
did not appear and after a minute or two she walked on in the
direction in which the March Hare was said to live  Ive seen
hatters before she said to herself the March Hare will be
much the most interesting and perhaps as this is May it wont be
raving madat least not so mad as it was in March  As she said
this she looked up and there was the Cat again sitting on a
branch of a tree

  Did you say pig or fig? said the Cat

  I said pig replied Alice and I wish you wouldnt keep
appearing and vanishing so suddenly  you make one quite giddy

  All right said the Cat and this time it vanished quite
slowly beginning with the end of the tail and ending with the
grin which remained some time after the rest of it had gone

  Well  Ive often seen a cat without a grin thought Alice
but a grin without a cat  Its the most curious thing I ever
say in my life

  She had not gone much farther before she came in sight of the
house of the March Hare  she thought it must be the right house
because the chimneys were shaped like ears and the roof was
thatched with fur  It was so large a house that she did not
like to go nearer till she had nibbled some more of the lefthand
bit of mushroom and raised herself to about two feet high  even
then she walked up towards it rather timidly saying to herself
Suppose it should be raving mad after all  I almost wish Id
gone to see the Hatter instead



                           CHAPTER VII

                         A Mad TeaParty


  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house
and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it  a
Dormouse was sitting between them fast asleep and the other two
were using it as a cushion resting their elbows on it and the
talking over its head  Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse
thought Alice only as its asleep I suppose it doesnt mind

  The table was a large one but the three were all crowded
together at one corner of it  No room  No room they cried
out when they saw Alice coming  Theres PLENTY of room said
Alice indignantly and she sat down in a large armchair at one
end of the table

  Have some wine the March Hare said in an encouraging tone

  Alice looked all round the table but there was nothing on it
but tea  I dont see any wine she remarked

  There isnt any said the March Hare

  Then it wasnt very civil of you to offer it said Alice
angrily

  It wasnt very civil of you to sit down without being
invited said the March Hare

  I didnt know it was YOUR table said Alice its laid for a
great many more than three

  Your hair wants cutting said the Hatter  He had been
looking at Alice for some time with great curiosity and this was
his first speech

  You should learn not to make personal remarks Alice said
with some severity its very rude

  The Hatter opened his eyes very wide on hearing this but all
he SAID was Why is E NKLAR VUEQ Y NDHGMDFRKVE?
