paper reproduction  The total amounted to a little under  per single
page volume with  percent overhead includeda figure competitive
with the prices currently charged by photocopy vendors

Of course with scanning in addition to the paper facsimile one is left
with a digital file from which subsequent copies of the book can be
produced for a fraction of the cost of photocopy with readers afforded
choices in the form of these copies

KENNEY concluded that digital technology offers an electronic means for a
library preservation effort to pay for itself  If a brittlebook program
included the means of disseminating reprints of books that are in demand
by libraries and researchers alike the initial investment in capture
could be recovered and used to preserve additional but less popular
books  She disclosed that an economic model for a selfsustaining
program could be developed for CXPs report to the Commission on
Preservation and Access CPA

KENNEY stressed that the focus of CXP has been on obtaining high quality
in a production environment  The use of digital technology is viewed as
an affordable alternative to other reformatting options

                                 


ANDRE  Overview and history of NATDP  Various agricultural CDROM
products created inhouse and by service bureaus  Pilot project on
Internet transmission  Additional products in progress 


Pamela ANDRE associate director for automation National Agricultural
Text Digitizing Program NATDP National Agricultural Library NAL
presented an overview of NATDP which has been underway at NAL the last
four years before Judith ZIDAR discussed the technical details  ANDRE
defined agricultural information as a broad range of material going from
basic and applied research in the hard sciences to the onepage pamphlets
that are distributed by the cooperative state extension services on such
things as how to grow blueberries

NATDP began in late  with a meeting of representatives from the
landgrant library community to deal with the issue of electronic
information  NAL and fortyfive of these libraries banded together to
establish this projectto evaluate the technology for converting what
were then source documents in paper form into electronic form to provide
access to that digital information and then to distribute it
Distributing that material to the communitythe university community as
well as the extension service community potentially down to the county
levelconstituted the groups chief concern

Since January  when the microcomputerbased scanning system was
installed at NAL NATDP has done a variety of things concerning which
ZIDAR would provide further details  For example the first technology
considered in the projects discussion phase was digital videodisc which
indicates how long ago it was conceived

Over the four years of this project four separate CDROM products on
four different agricultural topics were created two at a
scanningandOCR station installed at NAL and two by service bureaus
Thus NATDP has gained comparative information in terms of those relative
costs  Each of these products contained the full ASCII text as well as
page images of the material or between  and  pages of material
on these disks  Topics included aquaculture food agriculture and
science ie international agriculture and research acid rain and
Agent Orange which was the final product distributed approximately
eighteen months before the Workshop

The third phase of NATDP focused on delivery mechanisms other than
CDROM  At the suggestion of Clifford LYNCH who was a technical
consultant to the project at this point NATDP became involved with the
Internet and initiated a project with the help of North Carolina State
University in which fourteen of the landgrant university libraries are
transmitting digital images over the Internet in response to interlibrary
loan requestsa topic for another meeting  At this point the pilot
project had been completed for about a year and the final report would be
available shortly after the Workshop  In the meantime the projects
success had led to its extension  ANDRE noted that one of the first
things done under the program title was to select a retrieval package to
use with subsequent products Windows Personal Librarian was the package
of choice after a lengthy evaluation

Three additional products had been planned and were in progress

      An arrangement with the American Society of Agronomya
     professional society that has published the Agronomy Journal since
     about to scan and create bitmapped images of its journal
     ASA granted permission first to put and then to distribute this
     material in electronic form to hold it at NAL and to use these
     electronic images as a mechanism to deliver documents or print out
     material for patrons among other uses  Effectively NAL has the
     right to use this material in support of its program
     Significantly this arrangement offers a potential cooperative
     model for working with other professional societies in agriculture
     to try to do the same thingput the journals of particular interest
     to agriculture research into electronic form

      An extension of the earlier product on aquaculture

      The George Washington Carver Papersa joint project with
     Tuskegee University to scan and convert from microfilm some 
     images of Carvers papers letters and drawings

It was anticipated that all of these products would appear no more than
six months after the Workshop

                                 


ZIDAR  A separate arena for scanning  Steps in creating a database 
Image capture with and without performing OCR  Keying in tracking data
 Scanning with electronic and manual tracking  Adjustments during
scanning process  Scanning resolutions  Compression  Deskewing and
filtering  Image capture from microform  the papers and letters of
George Washington Carver  Equipment used for a scanning system 


Judith ZIDAR coordinator National Agricultural Text Digitizing Program
NATDP National Agricultural Library NAL illustrated the technical
details of NATDP including her primary responsibility scanning and
creating databases on a topic and putting them on CDROM

ZIDAR remarked a separate arena from the CDROM projects although the
processing of the material is nearly identical in which NATDP is also
scanning material and loading it on a Next microcomputer which in turn
is linked to NALs integrated library system  Thus searches in NALs
bibliographic database will enable people to pull up actual page images
and text for any documents that have been entered

In accordance with the sessions topic ZIDAR focused her illustrated
talk on image capture offering a primer on the three main steps in the
process   assemble the printed publications  design the database
database design occurs in the process of preparing the material for
scanning this step entails reviewing and organizing the material
defining the contentswhat will constitute a record what kinds of
fields will be captured in terms of author title etc  perform a
certain amount of markup on the paper publications  NAL performs this
task record by record preparing work sheets or some other sort of
tracking material and designing descriptors and other enhancements to be
added to the data that will not be captured from the printed publication
Part of this process also involves determining NATDPs file and directory
structure  NATDP attempts to avoid putting more than approximately 
images in a directory because placing more than that on a CDROM would
reduce the access speed

This upfront process takes approximately two weeks for a
page database  The next step is to capture the page images
How long this process takes is determined by the decision whether or not
to perform OCR  Not performing OCR speeds the process whereas text
capture requires greater care because of the quality of the image  it
has to be straighter and allowance must be made for text on a page not
just for the capture of photographs

NATDP keys in tracking data that is a standard bibliographic record
including the title of the book and the title of the chapter which will
later either become the access information or will be attached to the
front of a fulltext record so that it is searchable

Images are scanned from a bound or unbound publication chiefly from
bound publications in the case of NATDP however because often they are
the only copies and the publications are returned to the shelves  NATDP
usually scans one record at a time because its database tracking system
tracks the document in that way and does not require further logical
separating of the images  After performing optical character
recognition NATDP moves the images off the hard disk and maintains a
volume sheet  Though the system tracks electronically all the
processing steps are also tracked manually with a log sheet

ZIDAR next illustrated the kinds of adjustments that one can make when
scanning from paper and microfilm for example redoing images that need
special handling setting for dithering or gray scale and adjusting for
brightness or for the whole book at one time

NATDP is scanning at  dots per inch a standard scanning resolution
Though adequate for capturing text that is all of a standard size 
dpi is unsuitable for any kind of photographic material or for very small
text  Many scanners allow for different image formats TIFF of course
being a de facto standard  But if one intends to exchange images with
other people the ability to scan other image formats even if they are
less common becomes highly desirable

CCITT Group  is the standard compression for normal blackandwhite
images JPEG for gray scale or color   ZIDAR recommended  using the
standard compressions particularly if one attempts to make material
available and to allow users to download images and reuse them from
CDROMs and  maintaining the ability to output an uncompressed image
because in image exchange uncompressed images are more likely to be able
to cross platforms

ZIDAR emphasized the importance of deskewing and filtering as
requirements on NATDPs upgraded system  For instance scanning bound
books particularly books published by the federal government whose pages
are skewed and trying to scan them straight if OCR is to be performed
is extremely timeconsuming  The same holds for filtering of
poorquality or older materials

ZIDAR described image capture from microform using as an example three
reels from a sixtysevenreel set of the papers and letters of George
Washington Carver that had been produced by Tuskegee University  These
resulted in approximately  images which NATDP had had scanned by
its service contractor Science Applications International Corporation
SAIC  NATDP also created bibliographic records for access  NATDP did
not have such specialized equipment as a microfilm scanner

Unfortunately the process of scanning from microfilm was not an
unqualified success ZIDAR reported  because microfilm frame sizes vary
occasionally some frames were missed which without spending much time
and money could not be recaptured

OCR could not be performed from the scanned images of the frames  The
bleeding in the text simply output text when OCR was run that could not
even be edited  NATDP tested for negative versus positive images
landscape versus portrait orientation and single versus dualpage
microfilm none of which seemed to affect the quality of the image but
also on none of them could OCR be performed

In selecting the microfilm they would use therefore NATDP had other
factors in mind  ZIDAR noted two factors that influenced the quality of
the images   the inherent quality of the original and  the amount of
size reduction on the pages

The Carver papers were selected because they are informative and visually
interesting treat a single subject and are valuable in their own right
The images were scanned and divided into logical records by SAIC then
delivered and loaded onto NATDPs system where bibliographic
information taken directly from the images was added  Scanning was
completed in summer  and by the end of summer  the disk was
scheduled to be published

Problems encountered during processing included the following  Because
the microfilm scanning had to be done in a batch adjustment for
individual page variations was not possible  The frame size varied on
account of the nature of the material and therefore some of the frames
were missed while others were just partial frames  The only way to go
back and capture this material was to print out the page with the
microfilm reader from the missing frame and then scan it in from the
page which was extremely timeconsuming  The quality of the images
scanned from the printout of the microfilm compared unfavorably with that
of the original images captured directly from the microfilm  The
inability to perform OCR also was a major disappointment  At the time
computer output microfilm was unavailable to test

The equipment used for a scanning system was the last topic addressed by
ZIDAR  The type of equipment that one would purchase for a scanning
system included  a microcomputer at least a  but preferably a 
a large hard disk  megabyte at minimum a multitasking operating
system that allows one to run some things in batch in the background
while scanning or doing text editing for example Unix or OS and
theoretically Windows a highspeed scanner and scanning software that
allows one to make the various adjustments mentioned earlier a
highresolution monitor  dpi  OCR software and hardware to perform
text recognition an optical disk subsystem on which to archive all the
images as the processing is done file management and tracking software

ZIDAR opined that the software one purchases was more important than the
hardware and might also cost more than the hardware but it was likely to
prove critical to the success or failure of ones system  In addition to
a standalone scanning workstation for image capture then text capture
requires one or two editing stations networked to this scanning station
to perform editing  Editing the text takes two or three times as long as
capturing the images

Finally ZIDAR stressed the importance of buying an open system that allows
for more than one vendor complies with standards and can be upgraded

Donald WATERS head of the Systems Office Yale University Library
reported on the progress of a master plan for a project at Yale to
convert microfilm to digital imagery Project Open Book POB  Stating
that POB was in an advanced stage of planning WATERS detailed in
particular the process of selecting a vendor partner and several key
issues under discussion as Yale prepares to move into the project itself
He commented first on the vision that serves as the context of POB and
then described its purpose and scope

WATERS sees the library of the future not necessarily as an electronic
library but as a place that generates preserves and improves for its
clients ready access to both intellectual and physical recorded
knowledge  Electronic tools must find a place in the library in the
context of this vision  Several roles for electronic tools include
serving as  indirect sources of electronic knowledge or as "finding"
aids the online catalogues the articlelevel indices registers for
documents and archives direct sources of recorded knowledge fulltext
images and various kinds of compound sources of recorded knowledge the
socalled compound documents of Hypertext mixed text and image
mixedtext image format and multimedia

POB is looking particularly at images and an image library the uses to
which images will be put eg storage printing browsing and then use
as input for other processes OCR as a subsequent process to image
capture or creating an image library and also possibly generating
microfilm

While input will come from a variety of sources POB is considering
especially input from preservation microfilm  A possible outcome is that
the film and paper which provide the input for the image library
eventually may go off into remote storage and that the image library may
be the primary access tool

The purpose and scope of POB focus on imaging  Though related to CXP
POB has two features which distinguish it   scaleconversion of
 volumes into digital image form and  sourceconversion from
microfilm  Given these features several key working hypotheses guide
POB including   Since POB is using microfilm it is not concerned with
the image library as a preservation medium   Digital imagery can improve
access to recorded knowledge through printing and network distribution at
a modest incremental cost of microfilm   Capturing and storing documents
in a digital image form is necessary to further improvements in access
POB distinguishes between the imaging digitizing process and OCR
which at this stage it does not plan to perform

Currently in its first or organizational phase POB found that it could
use a vendor selection process to facilitate a good deal of the
organizational work eg creating a project team and advisory board
confirming the validity of the plan establishing the cost of the project
and a budget selecting the materials to convert and then raising the
necessary funds

POB developed numerous selection criteria including  a firm committed
to imagedocument management the ability to serve as systems integrator
in a largescale project over several years interest in developing the
requisite software as a standard rather than a custom product and a
willingness to invest substantial resources in the project itself

Two vendors DEC and Xerox were selected as finalists in October 
and with the support of the Commission on Preservation and Access each
was commissioned to generate a detailed requirements analysis for the
project and then to submit a formal proposal for the completion of the
project which included a budget and costs The terms were that POB would
pay the loser  The results for Yale of involving a vendor included
broad involvement of Yale staff across the board at a relatively low
cost which may have longterm significance in carrying out the project
twentyfive to thirty university people are engaged in POB better
understanding of the factors that affect corporate response to markets
for imaging products a competitive proposal and a more sophisticated
view of the imaging markets

The most important factor that distinguished the vendors under
consideration was their identification with the customer  The size and
internal complexity of the company also was an important factor  POB was
looking at large companies that had substantial resources  In the end
the process generated for Yale two competitive proposals with Xeroxs
the clear winner  WATERS then described the components of the proposal
the design principles and some of the costs estimated for the process

Components are essentially four  a conversion subsystem a
networkaccessible storage subsystem for  books and POB expects
 to  dpi storage browsing stations distributed on the campus
network and network access to the image printers

Among the design principles POB wanted conversion at the highest
possible resolution  Assuming TIFF files TIFF files with Group 
compression TCPIP and ethernet network on campus POB wanted a
clientserver approach with image documents distributed to the
workstations and made accessible through native workstation interfaces
such as Windows  POB also insisted on a phased approach to
implementation   a standalone singleuser lowcost entry into the
business with a workstation focused on conversion and allowing POB to
explore user access  movement into a highervolume conversion with
networkaccessible storage and multiple access stations and  a
highvolume conversion fullcapacity storage and multiple browsing
stations distributed throughout the campus

The costs proposed for startup assumed the existence of the Yale network
and its two DocuTech image printers  Other startup costs are estimated
at  million over the three phases  At the end of the project the annual
operating costs estimated primarily for the software and hardware proposed
come to about  but these exclude costs for labor needed in the
conversion process network and printer usage and facilities management

Finally the selection process produced for Yale a more sophisticated
view of the imaging markets  the management of complex documents in
image form is not a preservation problem not a library problem but a
general problem in a broad general industry  Preservation materials are
useful for developing that market because of the qualities of the
material  For example much of it is out of copyright  The resolution
of key issues such as the quality of scanning and image browsing also
will affect development of that market

The technology is readily available but changing rapidly  In this
context of rapid change several factors affect quality and cost to
which POB intends to pay particular attention for example the various
levels of resolution that can be achieved  POB believes it can bring
resolution up to  dpi but an interpolation process from  to  is
more likely  The variation quality in microfilm will prove to be a
highly important factor  POB may reexamine the standards used to film in
the first place by looking at this process as a followon to microfilming

Other important factors include  the techniques available to the
operator for handling material the ways of integrating quality control
into the digitizing work flow and a work flow that includes indexing and
storage  POBs requirement was to be able to deal with quality control
at the point of scanning  Thus thanks to Xerox POB anticipates having
a mechanism which will allow it not only to scan in batch form but to
review the material as it goes through the scanner and control quality
from the outset

The standards for measuring quality and costs depend greatly on the uses
of the material including subsequent OCR storage printing and
browsing  But especially at issue for POB is the facility for browsing
This facility WATERS said is perhaps the weakest aspect of imaging
technology and the most in need of development

A variety of factors affect the usability of complex documents in image
form among them   the ability of the system to handle the full range
of document types not just monographs but serials multipart
monographs and manuscripts  the location of the database of record
for bibliographic information about the image document which POB wants
to enter once and in the most useful place the online catalog  a
document identifier for referencing the bibliographic information in one
place and the images in another  the technique for making the basic
internal structure of the document accessible to the reader and finally
 the physical presentation on the CRT of those documents  POB is ready
to complete this phase now  One last decision involves deciding which
material to scan

                                 


DISCUSSION  TIFF files constitute de facto standard  NARAs experience
with image conversion software and text conversion  RFC  
Considerable flux concerning available hardware and software solutions 
NAL throughput rate during scanning  Window management questions 


In the questionandanswer period that followed WATERSs presentation
the following points emerged

      ZIDARs statement about using TIFF files as a standard meant de
     facto standard  This is what most people use and typically exchange
     with other groups across platforms or even occasionally across
     display software

      HOLMES commented on the unsuccessful experience of NARA in
     attempting to run imageconversion software or to exchange between
     applications  What are supposedly TIFF files go into other software
     that is supposed to be able to accept TIFF but cannot recognize the
     format and cannot deal with it and thus renders the exchange
     useless  Re text conversion he noted the different recognition
     rates obtained by substituting the make and model of scanners in
     NARAs recent test of an "intelligent" characterrecognition product
     for a new company  In the selection of hardware and software
     HOLMES argued software no longer constitutes the overriding factor
     it did until about a year ago rather it is perhaps important to
     look at both now

      Danny Cohen and Alan Katz of the University of Southern California
     Information Sciences Institute began circulating as an Internet RFC
     RFC  about a month ago a standard for a TIFF interchange
     format for Internet distribution of monochrome bitmapped images
     which LYNCH said he believed would be used as a de facto standard

      FLEISCHHAUERs impression from hearing these reports and thinking
     about AMs experience was that there is considerable flux concerning
     available hardware and software solutions  HOOTON agreed and
     commented at the same time on ZIDARs statement that the equipment
     employed affects the results produced  One cannot draw a complete
     conclusion by saying it is difficult or impossible to perform OCR
     from scanning microfilm for example with that device  that set of
     parameters and system requirements because numerous other people
     are accomplishing just that using other components perhaps
     HOOTON opined that both the hardware and the software were highly
     important  Most of the problems discussed today have been solved in
     numerous different ways by other people  Though it is good to be
     cognizant of various experiences this is not to say that it will
     always be thus

      At NAL the throughput rate of the scanning process for paper
     page by page performing OCR ranges from  to  pages per day
     not performing OCR is considerably faster although how much faster
     is not known  This is for scanning from bound books which is much
     slower

      WATERS commented on window management questions  DEC proposed an
     XWindows solution which was problematical for two reasons  One was
     POBs requirement to be able to manipulate images on the workstation
     and bring them down to the workstation itself and the other was
     network usage

                                 


THOMA  Illustration of deficiencies in scanning and storage process 
Image quality in this process  Different costs entailed by better image
quality  Techniques for overcoming various deficiencies  fixed
thresholding dynamic thresholding dithering image merge  Page edge
effects 


George THOMA chief Communications Engineering Branch National Library
of Medicine NLM illustrated several of the deficiencies discussed by
the previous speakers  He introduced the topic of special problems by
noting the advantages of electronic imaging  For example it is regenerable
because it is a coded file and realtime quality control is possible with
electronic capture whereas in photographic capture it is not

One of the difficulties discussed in the scanning and storage process was
image quality which without belaboring the obvious means different
things for maps medical Xrays or broadcast television  In the case of
documents THOMA said image quality boils down to legibility of the
textual parts and fidelity in the case of gray or color photo printtype
material  Legibility boils down to scan density the standard in most
cases being  dpi  Increasing the resolution with scanners that
perform  or  dpi however comes at a cost

Better image quality entails at least four different kinds of costs  
equipment costs because the CCD ie chargecouple device with
greater number of elements costs more   time costs that translate to
the actual capture costs because manual labor is involved the time is
also dependent on the fact that more data has to be moved around in the
machine in the scanning or network devices that perform the scanning as
well as the storage   media costs because at high resolutions larger
files have to be stored and  transmission costs because there is just
more data to be transmitted

But while resolution takes care of the issue of legibility in image
quality other deficiencies have to do with contrast and elements on the
page scanned or the image that needed to be removed or clarified  Thus
THOMA proceeded to illustrate various deficiencies how they are
manifested and several techniques to overcome them

Fixed thresholding was the first technique described suitable for
blackandwhite text when the contrast does not vary over the page  One
can have many different threshold levels in scanning devices  Thus
THOMA offered an example of extremely poor contrast which resulted from
the fact that the stock was a heavy red  This is the sort of image that
when microfilmed fails to provide any legibility whatsoever  Fixed
thresholding is the way to change the blacktored contrast to the
desired blacktowhite contrast

Other examples included material that had been browned or yellowed by
age  This was also a case of contrast deficiency and correction was
done by fixed thresholding  A final example boils down to the same
thing slight variability but it is not significant  Fixed thresholding
solves this problem as well  The microfilm equivalent is certainly legible
but it comes with dark areas  Though THOMA did not have a slide of the
microfilm in this case he did show the reproduced electronic image

When one has variable contrast over a page or the lighting over the page
area varies especially in the case where a bound volume has light
shining on it the image must be processed by a dynamic thresholding
scheme  One scheme dynamic averaging allows the threshold level not to
be fixed but to be recomputed for every pixel from the neighboring
characteristics  The neighbors of a pixel determine where the threshold
should be set for that pixel

THOMA showed an example of a page that had been made deficient by a
variety of techniques including a burn mark coffee stains and a yellow
marker  Application of a fixedthresholding scheme THOMA argued might
take care of several deficiencies on the page but not all of them
Performing the calculation for a dynamic threshold setting however
removes most of the deficiencies so that at least the text is legible

Another problem is representing a gray level with blackandwhite pixels
by a process known as dithering or electronic screening  But dithering
does not provide good image quality for pure blackandwhite textual
material  THOMA illustrated this point with examples Although its
suitability for photoprint is the reason for electronic screening or
dithering it cannot be used for every compound image  In the document
that was distributed by CXP THOMA noticed that the dithered image of the
IEEE test chart evinced some deterioration in the text  He presented an
extreme example of deterioration in the text in which compounded
documents had to be set right by other techniques  The technique
illustrated by the present example was an image merge in which the page
is scanned twice and the settings go from fixed threPMIVN ZM PMY
