    The country has no known mineral resources and few exports Subsistence
    farming and fishing are the primary economic activities The islands are too
    small and too remote for development of a tourist industry Government
    revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
    remittances Substantial income is received annually from an international
    trust fund established in  by Australia New Zealand and the UK and
    supported also by Japan and South Korea
