In Pontus or the Punick coast or where
Alcinous reigned fruit of all kinds in coat
Rough or smooth rind or bearded husk or shell
She gathers tribute large and on the board
Heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape
She crushes inoffensive must and meaths
From many a berry and from sweet kernels pressed
She tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold
Wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground
With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed
Mean while our primitive great sire to meet
His Godlike guest walks forth without more train
Accompanied than with his own complete
Perfections in himself was all his state
More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits
On princes when their rich retinue long
Of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold
Dazzles the croud and sets them all agape
Nearer his presence Adam though not awed
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek
As to a superiour nature bowing low
Thus said  Native of Heaven for other place
None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain
Since by descending from the thrones above
Those happy places thou hast deigned a while
To want and honour these vouchsafe with us
Two only who yet by sovran gift possess
This spacious ground in yonder shady bower
To rest and what the garden choicest bears
To sit and taste till this meridian heat
Be over and the sun more cool decline
Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild
Adam I therefore came nor art thou such
Created or such place hast here to dwell
As may not oft invite though Spirits of Heaven
To visit thee lead on then where thy bower
Oershades for these midhours till evening rise
I have at will  So to the sylvan lodge
They came that like Pomonas arbour smiled
With flowerets decked and fragrant smells but Eve
Undecked save with herself more lovely fair
Than WoodNymph or the fairest Goddess feigned
Of three that in mount Ida naked strove
Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven no veil
She needed virtueproof no thought infirm
Altered her cheek  On whom the Angel Hail
Bestowed the holy salutation used
Long after to blest Mary second Eve
Hail Mother of Mankind whose fruitful womb
Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons
Than with these various fruits the trees of God
Have heaped this tableRaised of grassy turf
Their table was and mossy seats had round
And on her ample square from side to side
All autumn piled though spring and autumn here
Danced hand in hand  A while discourse they hold
No fear lest dinner cool when thus began
Our author  Heavenly stranger please to taste
These bounties which our Nourisher from whom
All perfect good unmeasured out descends
To us for food and for delight hath caused
The earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps
To spiritual natures only this I know
That one celestial Father gives to all
To whom the Angel  Therefore what he gives
Whose praise be ever sung to Man in part
Spiritual may of purest Spirits be found
No ingrateful food  And food alike those pure
Intelligential substances require
As doth your rational and both contain
Within them every lower faculty
Of sense whereby they hear see smell touch taste
Tasting concoct digest assimilate
And corporeal to incorporeal turn
For know whatever was created needs
To be sustained and fed  Of elements
The grosser feeds the purer earth the sea
Earth and the sea feed air the air those fires
Ethereal and as lowest first the moon
Whence in her visage round those spots unpurged
Vapours not yet into her substance turned
Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale
From her moist continent to higher orbs
The sun that light imparts to all receives
From all his alimental recompence
In humid exhalations and at even
Sups with the ocean  Though in Heaven the trees
Of life ambrosial fruitage bear and vines
Yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn
We brush mellifluous dews and find the ground
Covered with pearly grain  Yet God hath here
Varied his bounty so with new delights
As may compare with Heaven and to taste
Think not I shall be nice  So down they sat
And to their viands fell nor seemingly
The Angel nor in mist the common gloss
Of Theologians but with keen dispatch
Of real hunger and concoctive heat
To transubstantiate  What redounds transpires
Through Spirits with ease nor wonderif by fire
Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist
Can turn or holds it possible to turn
Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold
As from the mine  Mean while at table Eve
Ministered naked and their flowing cups
With pleasant liquours crowned  O innocence
Deserving Paradise if ever then
Then had the sons of God excuse to have been
Enamoured at that sight but in those hearts
Love unlibidinous reigned nor jealousy
Was understood the injured lovers hell
Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed
Not burdened nature sudden mind arose
In Adam not to let the occasion pass
Given him by this great conference to know
Of things above his world and of their being
Who dwell in Heaven whose excellence he saw
Transcend his own so far whose radiant forms
Divine effulgence whose high power so far
Exceeded human and his wary speech
Thus to the empyreal minister he framed
Inhabitant with God now know I well
Thy favour in this honour done to Man
Under whose lowly roof thou hast vouchsafed
To enter and these earthly fruits to taste
Food not of Angels yet accepted so
As that more willingly thou couldst not seem
At Heavens high feasts to have fed yet what compare
To whom the winged Hierarch replied
O Adam One Almighty is from whom
All things proceed and up to him return
If not depraved from good created all
Such to perfection one first matter all
Endued with various forms various degrees
Of substance and in things that live of life
But more refined more spiritous and pure
As nearer to him placed or nearer tending
Each in their several active spheres assigned
Till body up to spirit work in bounds
Proportioned to each kind  So from the root
Springs lighter the green stalk from thence the leaves
More aery last the bright consummate flower
Spirits odorous breathes flowers and their fruit
Mans nourishment by gradual scale sublimed
To vital spirits aspire to animal
To intellectual give both life and sense
Fancy and understanding whence the soul
Reason receives and reason is her being
Discursive or intuitive discourse
Is oftest yours the latter most is ours
Differing but in degree of kind the same
Wonder not then what God for you saw good
If I refuse not but convert as you
To proper substance  Time may come when Men
With Angels may participate and find
No inconvenient diet nor too light fare
And from these corporal nutriments perhaps
Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit
Improved by tract of time and winged ascend
Ethereal as we or may at choice
Here or in heavenly Paradises dwell
If ye be found obedient and retain
Unalterably firm his love entire
Whose progeny you are  Mean while enjoy
Your fill what happiness this happy state
Can comprehend incapable of more
To whom the patriarch of mankind replied
O favourable Spirit propitious guest
Well hast thou taught the way that might direct
Our knowledge and the scale of nature set
From center to circumference whereon
In contemplation of created things
By steps we may ascend to God  But say
What meant that caution joined If ye be found
Obedient?  Can we want obedience then
To him or possibly his love desert
Who formed us from the dust and placed us here
Full to the utmost measure of what bliss
Human desires can seek or apprehend?
To whom the Angel  Son of Heaven and Earth
Attend  That thou art happy owe to God
That thou continuest such owe to thyself
That is to thy obedience therein stand
This was that caution given thee be advised
