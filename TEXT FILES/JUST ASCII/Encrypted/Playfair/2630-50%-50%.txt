Fathers CDROM is still in its infancy  Serious software problems remain
to be resolved before the material can be put into readable form

Funding from the Packard Foundation resulted in a major push to
transcribe the  or so documents of the Washington papers remaining
to be transcribed onto computer disks  Slides illustrated several of the
problems encountered for example the present inability of CDROM to
indicate the crossouts deleted material in eighteenth century
documents  TWOHIG next described documents from various periods in the
eighteenth century that have been transcribed in chronological order and
delivered to the Packard offices in California where they are converted
to the CDROM a process that is expected to consume five years to
complete that is reckoning from David Packards suggestion made several
years ago until about July   TWOHIG found an encouraging
indication of the projects benefits in the ongoing use made by scholars
of the search functions of the CDROM particularly in reducing the time
spent in manually turning the pages of the Washington papers

TWOHIG next furnished details concerning the accuracy of transcriptions
For instance the insertion of thousands of documents on the CDROM
currently does not permit each document to be verified against the
original manuscript several times as in the case of documents that appear
in the published edition  However the transcriptions receive a cursory
check for obvious typos the misspellings of proper names and other
errors from the WPP CDROM editor  Eventually all documents that appear
in the electronic version will be checked by project editors  Although
this process has met with opposition from some of the editors on the
grounds that imperfect work may leave their offices the advantages in
making this material available as a research tool outweigh  fears about the
misspelling of proper names and other relatively minor editorial matters

Completion of all five Founding Fathers projects ie retrievability
and searchability of all of the documents by proper names alternate
spellings or varieties of subjects will provide one of the richest
sources of this size for the history of the United States in the latter
part of the eighteenth century  Further publication on CDROM will
allow editors to include even minutiae such as laundry lists not
included in the printed volumes

It seems possible that the extensive annotation provided in the printed
volumes eventually will be added to the CDROM edition pending
negotiations with the publishers of the papers  At the moment the
Founding Fathers CDROM is accessible only on the IBYCUS a computer
developed out of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae project and designed for
the use of classical scholars  There are perhaps  IBYCUS computers in
the country most of which are in university classics departments
Ultimately it is anticipated that the CDROM edition of the Founding
Fathers documents will run on any IBMcompatible or Macintosh computer
with a CDROM drive  Numerous changes in the software will also occur
before the project is completed  Editors note an IBYCUS was
unavailable to demonstrate the CDROM

                                 


DISCUSSION  Several additional features of WPP clarified 


Discussion following TWOHIGs presentation served to clarify several
additional features including  that the projects primary
intellectual product consists in the electronic transcription of the
material  that the text transmitted to the CDROM people is not
marked up  that cataloging and subjectindexing of the material
remain to be worked out though at this point material can be retrieved
by name and  that because all the searching is done in the hardware
the IBYCUS is designed to read a CDROM which contains only sequential
text files  Technically it then becomes very easy to read the material
off and put it on another device

                                 


LEBRON  Overview of the history of the joint project between AAAS and
OCLC  Several practices the online environment shares with traditional
publishing on hard copy  Several technical and behavioral barriers to
electronic publishing  How AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of
clinical trials  Advantages of the electronic format and other features
of OJCCT  An illustrated tour of the journal 


Maria LEBRON managing editor The Online Journal of Current Clinical
Trials OJCCT presented an illustrated overview of the history of the
joint project between the American Association for the Advancement of
Science AAAS and the Online Computer Library Center Inc OCLC  The
joint venture between AAAS and OCLC owes its beginning to a
reorganization launched by the new chief executive officer at OCLC about
three years ago and combines the strengths of these two disparate
organizations  In short OJCCT represents the process of scholarly
publishing on line

LEBRON next discussed several practices the online environment shares
with traditional publishing on hard copyfor example peer review of
manuscriptsthat are highly important in the academic world  LEBRON
noted in particular the implications of citation counts for tenure
committees and grants committees  In the traditional hardcopy
environment citation counts are readily demonstrable whereas the
online environment represents an ethereal medium to most academics

LEBRON remarked several technical and behavioral barriers to electronic
publishing for instance the problems in transmission created by special
characters or by complex graphics and halftones  In addition she noted
economic limitations such as the storage costs of maintaining back issues
and market or audience education

Manuscripts cannot be uploaded to OJCCT LEBRON explained because it is
not a bulletin board or Email forms of electronic transmission of
information that have created an ambience clouding peoples understanding
of what the journal is attempting to do  OJCCT which publishes
peerreviewed medical articles dealing with the subject of clinical
trials includes text tabular material and graphics although at this
time it can transmit only line illustrations

Next LEBRON described how AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of
clinical trials  It is  a highly statistical discipline that  does
not require halftones but can satisfy the needs of its audience with line
illustrations and graphic material and  there is a need for the speedy
dissemination of highquality research results  Clinical trials are
research activities that involve the administration of a test treatment
to some experimental unit in order to test its usefulness before it is
made available to the general population  LEBRON proceeded to give
additional information on OJCCT concerning its editorinchief editorial
board editorial content and the types of articles it publishes
including peerreviewed research reports and reviews as well as
features shared by other traditional hardcopy journals

Among the advantages of the electronic format are faster dissemination of
information including raw data and the absence of space constraints
because pages do not exist  This latter fact creates an interesting
situation when it comes to citations  Nor are there any issues  AAASs
capacity to download materials directly from the journal to a
subscribers printer hard drive or floppy disk helps ensure highly
accurate transcription  Other features of OJCCT include onscreen alerts
that allow linkage of subsequently published documents to the original
documents online searching by subject author title etc indexing of
every single word that appears in an article viewing access to an
article by component abstract full text or graphs numbered
paragraphs to replace page counts publication in Science every thirty
days of indexing of all articles published in the journal
typesetquality screens and Hypertext links that enable subscribers to
bring up Medline abstracts directly without leaving the journal
