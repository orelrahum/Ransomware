Occasion which now smiles behold alone
The woman opportune to all attempts
Her husband for I view far round not nigh
Whose higher intellectual more I shun
And strength of courage haughty and of limb
Heroick built though of terrestrial mould
Foe not informidable exempt from wound
I not so much hath Hell debased and pain
Enfeebled me to what I was in Heaven
She fair divinely fair fit love for Gods
Not terrible though terrour be in love
And beauty not approached by stronger hate
Hate stronger under show of love well feigned
The way which to her ruin now I tend
So spake the enemy of mankind enclosed
In serpent inmate bad and toward Eve
Addressed his way not with indented wave
Prone on the ground as since but on his rear
Circular base of rising folds that towered
Fold above fold a surging maze his head
Crested aloft and carbuncle his eyes
With burnished neck of verdant gold erect
Amidst his circling spires that on the grass
Floated redundant pleasing was his shape
And lovely never since of serpentkind
Lovelier not those that in Illyria changed
Hermione and Cadmus or the god
In Epidaurus nor to which transformed
Ammonian Jove or Capitoline was seen
He with Olympias this with her who bore
Scipio the highth of Rome  With tract oblique
At first as one who sought access but feared
To interrupt sidelong he works his way
As when a ship by skilful steersmen wrought
Nigh rivers mouth or foreland where the wind
Veers oft as oft so steers and shifts her sail
So varied he and of his tortuous train
Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve
To lure her eye she busied heard the sound
Of rusling leaves but minded not as used
To such disport before her through the field
From every beast more duteous at her call
Than at Circean call the herd disguised
He bolder now uncalled before her stood
But as in gaze admiring oft he bowed
His turret crest and sleek enamelled neck
Fawning and licked the ground whereon she trod
His gentle dumb expression turned at length
The eye of Eve to mark his play he glad
Of her attention gained with serpenttongue
Organick or impulse of vocal air
His fraudulent temptation thus began
Wonder not sovran Mistress if perhaps
Thou canst who art sole wonder much less arm
Thy looks the Heaven of mildness with disdain
Displeased that I approach thee thus and gaze
Insatiate I thus singlenor have feared
Thy awful brow more awful thus retired
Fairest resemblance of thy Maker fair
Thee all things living gaze on all things thine
By gift and thy celestial beauty adore
With ravishment beheld there best beheld
Where universally admired but here
In this enclosure wild these beasts among
Beholders rude and shallow to discern
Half what in thee is fair one man except
Who sees thee? and what is one? who should be seen
A Goddess among Gods adored and served
By Angels numberless thy daily train
So glozed the Tempter and his proem tuned
Into the heart of Eve his words made way
Though at the voice much marvelling at length
Not unamazed she thus in answer spake
What may this mean? language of man pronounced
By tongue of brute and human sense expressed?
The first at least of these I thought denied
To beasts whom God on their creationday
Created mute to all articulate sound
The latter I demur for in their looks
Much reason and in their actions oft appears
Thee Serpent subtlest beast of all the field
I knew but not with human voice endued
Redouble then this miracle and say
How camest thou speakable of mute and how
To me so friendly grown above the rest
Of brutal kind that daily are in sight?
Say for such wonder claims attention due
To whom the guileful Tempter thus replied
Empress of this fair world resplendent Eve
Easy to me it is to tell thee all
What thou commandest and right thou shouldst be obeyed
I was at first as other beasts that graze
The trodden herb of abject thoughts and low
As was my food nor aught but food discerned
Or sex and apprehended nothing high
Till on a day roving the field I chanced
A goodly tree far distant to behold
Loaden with fruit of fairest colours mixed
Ruddy and gold I nearer drew to gaze
When from the boughs a savoury odour blown
Grateful to appetite more pleased my sense
Than smell of sweetest fennel or the teats
Of ewe or goat dropping with milk at even
Unsucked of lamb or kid that tend their play
To satisfy the sharp desire I had
Of tasting those fair apples I resolved
Not to defer hunger and thirst at once
Powerful persuaders quickened at the scent
Of that alluring fruit urged me so keen
About the mossy trunk I wound me soon
For high from ground the branches would require
Thy utmost reach or Adams Round the tree
All other beasts that saw with like desire
Longing and envying stood but could not reach
Amid the tree now got where plenty hung
Tempting so nigh to pluck and eat my fill
I spared not for such pleasure till that hour
At feed or fountain never had I found
Sated at length ere long I might perceive
Strange alteration in me to degree
Of reason in my inward powers and speech
Wanted not long though to this shape retained
Thenceforth to speculations high or deep
I turned my thoughts and with capacious mind
Considered all things visible in Heaven
Or Earth or Middle all things fair and good
But all that fair and good in thy divine
Semblance and in thy beautys heavenly ray
United I beheld no fair to thine
Equivalent or second which compelled
Me thus though importune perhaps to come
And gaze and worship thee of right declared
Sovran of creatures universal Dame
So talked the spirited sly Snake and Eve
Yet more amazed unwary thus replied
Serpent thy overpraising leaves in doubt
The virtue of that fruit in thee first proved
But say where grows the tree? from hence how far?
For many are the trees of God that grow
In Paradise and various yet unknown
To us in such abundance lies our choice
As leaves a greater store of fruit untouched
Still hanging incorruptible till men
Grow up to their provision and more hands
Help to disburden Nature of her birth
To whom the wily Adder blithe and glad
Empress the way is ready and not long
Beyond a row of myrtles on a flat
Fast by a fountain one small thicket past
Of blowing myrrh and balm if thou accept
My conduct I can bring thee thither soon
Lead then said Eve  He leading swiftly rolled
In tangles and made intricate seem straight
To mischief swift  Hope elevates and joy
Brightens his crest as when a wandering fire
Compact of unctuous vapour which the night
Condenses and the cold environs round
Kindled through agitation to a flame
Which oft they say some evil Spirit attends
Hovering and blazing with delusive light
Misleads the amazed nightwanderer from his way
To bogs and mires and oft through pond or pool
There swallowed up and lost from succour far
So glistered the dire Snake and into fraud
Led Eve our credulous mother to the tree
Of prohibition root of all our woe
Which when she saw thus to her guide she spake
Serpent we might have spared our coming hither
Fruitless to me though fruit be here to excess
The credit of whose virtue rest with thee
Wonderous indeed if cause of such effects
But of this tree we may not taste nor touch
God so commanded and left that command
Sole daughter of his voice the rest we live
Law to ourselves our reason is our law
To whom the Tempter guilefully replied
Indeed hath God then said that of the fruit
Of all these gardentrees ye shall not eat
Yet Lords declared of all in earth or air?
To whom thus Eve yet sinless  Of the fruit
Of each tree in the garden we may eat
But of the fruit of this fair tree amidst
The garden God hath said Ye shall not eat
Thereof nor shall ye touch it lest ye die
She scarce had said though brief when now more bold
The Tempter but with show of zeal and love
To Man and indignation at his wrong
New part puts on and as to passion moved
Fluctuates disturbed yet comely and in act
Raised as of some great matter to begin
As when of old some orator renowned
In Athens or free Rome where eloquence
Flourished since mute to some great cause addressed
Stood in himself collected while each part
Motion each act won audience ere the tongue
Sometimes in highth began as no delay
Of preface brooking through his zeal of right
So standing moving or to highth up grown
The Tempter all impassioned thus began
O sacred wise and wisdomgiving Plant
Mother of science now I feel thy power
Within me clear not only to discern
Things in their causes but to trace the ways
Of highest agents deemed however wise
Queen of this universe do not believe
Those rigid threats of death ye shall not die
How should you? by the fruit? it gives you life
To knowledge by the threatener? look on me
Me who have touched and tasted yet both live
And life more perfect have attained than Fate
Meant me by venturing higher than my lot
Shall that be shut to Man which to the Beast
Is open? or will God incense his ire
For such a petty trespass? and not praise
Rather your dauntless virtue whom the pain
Of death denounced whatever thing death be
Deterred not from achieving what might lead
To happier life knowledge of good and evil
Of good how just? of evil if what is evil
Be real why not known since easier shunned?
God therefore cannot hurt ye and be just
Not just not God not feared then nor obeyed
Your fear itself of death removes the fear
Why then was this forbid?  Why but to awe
Why but to keep ye low and ignorant
His worshippers?  He knows that in the day
Ye eat thereof your eyes that seem so clear
Yet are but dim shall perfectly be then
Opened and cleared and ye shall be as Gods
Knowing both good and evil as they know
That ye shall be as Gods since I as Man
Internal Man is but proportion meet
I of brute human ye of human Gods
So ye shall die perhaps by putting off
Human to put on Gods death to be wished
Though threatened which no worse than this can bring
And what are Gods that Man may not become
As they participating Godlike food?
The Gods are first and that advantage use
On our belief that all from them proceeds
I question it for this fair earth I see
Warmed by the sun producing every kind
Them nothing if they all things who enclosed
Knowledge of good and evil in this tree
That whoso eats thereof forthwith attains
Wisdom without their leave? and wherein lies
The offence that Man should thus attain to know?
What can your knowledge hurt him or this tree
Impart against his will if all be his?
Or is it envy? and can envy dwell
In heavenly breasts?  These these and many more
Causes import your need of this fair fruit
Goddess humane reach then and freely taste
He ended and his words replete with guile
Into her heart too easy entrance won
Fixed on the fruit she gazed which to behold
Might tempt alone and in her ears the sound
Yet rung of his persuasive words impregned
With reason to her seeming and with truth
Mean while the hour of noon drew on and waked
An eager appetite raised by the smell
So savoury of that fruit which with desire
Inclinable now grown to touch or taste
Solicited her longing eye yet first
Pausing a while thus to herself she mused
Great are thy virtues doubtless best of fruits
Though kept from man and worthy to be admired
Whose taste too long forborn at first assay
Gave elocution to the mute and taught
The tongue not made for speech to speak thy praise
Thy praise he also who forbids thy use
Conceals not from us naming thee the tree
Of knowledge knowledge both of good and evil
Forbids us then to taste but his forbidding
Commends thee more while it infers the good
By thee communicated and our want
For good unknown sure is not had or had
And yet unknown is as not had at all
In plain then what forbids he but to know
Forbids us good forbids us to be wise?
Such prohibitions bind not  But if death
Bind us with afterbands what profits then
Our inward freedom?  In the day we eat
Of this fair fruit our doom is we shall die
How dies the Serpent? he hath eaten and lives
And knows and speaks and reasons and discerns
Irrational till then  For us alone
Was death invented? or to us denied
This intellectual food for beasts reserved?
For beasts it seems yet that one beast which first
Hath tasted envies not but brings with joy
The good befallen him author unsuspect
Friendly to man far from deceit or guile
What fear I then? rather what know to fear
Under this ignorance of good and evil
Of God or death of law or penalty?
Here grows the cure of all this fruit divine
Fair to the eye inviting to the taste
Of virtue to make wise  What hinders then
To reach and feed at once both body and mind?
So saying her rash hand in evil hour
Forth reaching to the fruit she plucked she eat
Earth felt the wound and Nature from her seat
Sighing through all her works gave signs of woe
That all was lost  Back to the thicket slunk
The guilty Serpent and well mightfor Eve
Intent now wholly on her taste nought else
Regarded such delight till then as seemed
In fruit she never tasted whether true
Or fancied so through expectation high
Of knowledge not was Godhead from her thought
Greedily she ingorged without restraint
And knew not eating death  Satiate at length
And hightened as with wine jocund and boon
Thus to herself she pleasingly began
O sovran virtuous precious of all trees
In Paradise of operation blest
To sapience hitherto obscured infamed
And thy fair fruit let hang as to no end
Created but henceforth my early care
Not without song each morning and due praise
Shall tend thee and the fertile burden ease
Of thy full branches offered free to all
Till dieted by thee I grow mature
In knowledge as the Gods who all things know
Though others envy what they cannot give
For had the gift been theirs it had not here
Thus grown  Experience next to thee I owe
Best guide not following thee I had remained
In ignorance thou openest wisdoms way
And givest access though secret she retire
And I perhaps am secret Heaven is high
High and remote to see from thence distinct
Each thing on Earth and other care perhaps
May have diverted from continual watch
Our great Forbidder safe with all his spies
About him  But to Adam in what sort
Shall I appear? shall I to him make known
As yet my change and give him to partake
Full happiness with me or rather not
But keeps the odds of knowledge in my power
Without copartner? so to add what wants
In female sex the more to draw his love
And render me more equal and perhaps
A thing not undesirable sometime
Superiour for inferiour who is free
This may be well  But what if God have seen
And death ensue? then I shall be no more
And Adam wedded to another Eve
Shall live with her enjoying I extinct
A death to think  Confirmed then I resolve
Adam shall share with me in bliss or woe
So dear I love him that with him all deaths
I could endure without him live no life
So saying from the tree her step she turned
But first low reverence done as to the Power
That dwelt within whose presence had infused
Into the plant sciential sap derived
From nectar drink of Gods  Adam the while
Waiting desirous her return had wove
Of choicest flowers a garland to adorn
Her tresses and her rural labours crown
As reapers oft are wont their harvestqueen
Great joy he promised to his thoughts and new
Solace in her return so long delayed
Yet oft his heart divine of something ill
Misgave him he the faltering measure felt
And forth to meet her went the way she took
That morn when first they parted by the tree
Of knowledge he must pass there he her met
Scarce from the tree returning in her hand
A bough of fairest fruit that downy smiled
New gathered and ambrosial smell diffused
To him she hasted in her face excuse
Came prologue and apology too prompt
Which with bland words at will she thus addressed
Hast thou not wondered Adam at my stay?
Thee I have missed and thought it long deprived
Thy presence agony of love till now
Not felt nor shall be twice for never more
Mean I to try what rash untried I sought
The pain of absence from thy sight  But strange
Hath been the cause and wonderful tM RSEN
