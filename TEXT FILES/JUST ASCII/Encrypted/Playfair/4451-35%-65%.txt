Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire
To blood unshed the rivers must be turned
Frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill
With loathed intrusion and fill all the land
His cattle must of rot and murren die
Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss
And all his people thunder mixed with hail
Hail mixed with fire must rend the Egyptians sky
And wheel on the earth devouring where it rolls
What it devours not herb or fruit or grain
A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down
Must eat and on the ground leave nothing green
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds
Palpable darkness and blot out three days
Last with one midnight stroke all the firstborn
Of Egypt must lie dead  Thus with ten wounds
The riverdragon tamed at length submits
To let his sojourners depart and oft
Humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice
More hardened after thaw till in his rage
Pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea
Swallows him with his host but them lets pass
As on dry land between two crystal walls
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand
Divided till his rescued gain their shore
Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend
Though present in his Angel who shall go
Before them in a cloud and pillar of fire
By day a cloud by night a pillar of fire
To guide them in their journey and remove
Behind them while the obdurate king pursues
All night he will pursue but his approach
Darkness defends between till morning watch
Then through the fiery pillar and the cloud
God looking forth will trouble all his host
And craze their chariotwheels when by command
Moses once more his potent rod extends
Over the sea the sea his rod obeys
On their embattled ranks the waves return
And overwhelm their war  The race elect
Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance
Through the wild Desart not the readiest way
Lest entering on the Canaanite alarmed
War terrify them inexpert and fear
Return them back to Egypt choosing rather
Inglorious life with servitude for life
To noble and ignoble is more sweet
Untrained in arms where rashness leads not on
This also shall they gain by their delay
In the wide wilderness there they shall found
Their government and their great senate choose
Through the twelve tribes to rule by laws ordained
God from the mount of Sinai whose gray top
Shall tremble he descending will himself
In thunder lightning and loud trumpets sound
Ordain them laws part such as appertain
To civil justice part religious rites
Of sacrifice informing them by types
And shadows of that destined Seed to bruise
The Serpent by what means he shall achieve
Mankinds deliverance  But the voice of God
To mortal ear is dreadful  They beseech
That Moses might report to them his will
And terrour cease he grants what they besought
Instructed that to God is no access
Without Mediator whose high office now
Moses in figure bears to introduce
One greater of whose day he shall foretel
And all the Prophets in their age the times
Of great Messiah shall sing  Thus laws and rites
Established such delight hath God in Men
Obedient to his will that he vouchsafes
Among them to set up his tabernacle
The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed
Of cedar overlaid with gold therein
An ark and in the ark his testimony
The records of his covenant over these
A mercyseat of gold between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim before him burn
Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing
The heavenly fires over the tent a cloud
Shall rest by day a fiery gleam by night
Save when they journey and at length they come
Conducted by his Angel to the land
Promised to Abraham and his seedThe rest
Were long to tell how many battles fought
How many kings destroyed and kingdoms won
Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still
A day entire and nights due course adjourn
Mans voice commanding Sun in Gibeon stand
And thou moon in the vale of Aialon
Till Israel overcome so call the third
From Abraham son of Isaac and from him
His whole descent who thus shall Canaan win
Here Adam interposed  O sent from Heaven
Enlightener of my darkness gracious things
Thou hast revealed those chiefly which concern
Just Abraham and his seed now first I find
Mine eyes trueopening and my heart much eased
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become
Of me and all mankind  But now I see
His day in whom all nations shall be blest
Favour unmerited by me who sought
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means
This yet I apprehend not why to those
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth
So many and so various laws are given
So many laws argue so many sins
Among them how can God with such reside?
To whom thus Michael  Doubt not but that sin
Will reign among them as of theS SQZIZ
