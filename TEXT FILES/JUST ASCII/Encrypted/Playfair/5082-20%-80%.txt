Serbia and Montenegro Economy

Overview
    The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been accompanied by bloody
    ethnic warfare the destabilization of republic boundaries and the breakup
    of important interrepublic trade flows The situation in Serbia and
    Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military
    strife This new state faces major economic problems First like the other
    former Yugoslav republics Serbia and Montenegro depended on their sister
    republics for large amounts of foodstuffs energy supplies and
    manufactures Wide varieties in climate mineral resources and levels of
    technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence as did
    the Communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
    number of giant plants The breakup of many of the trade links the sharp
    drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets and the
    destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the
    economic difficulties of the republics One singular factor in the economic
    situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a
    Communist government that is primarily interested in political and military
    mastery not economic reform A further complication is the major economic
    sanctions by the leading industrial nations

Sierra Leone Economy

Overview
    The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed Subsistence
    agriculture dominates the economy generating about onethird of GDP and
    employing about twothirds of the working population Manufacturing which
    accounts for roughly  of GDP consists mainly of the processing of raw
    materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market Diamond mining
    provides an important source of hard currency The economy suffers from high
    unemployment rising inflation large trade deficits and a growing
    dependency on foreign assistance The government in  was attempting to
    get the budget deficit under control and in general to bring economic
    policy in line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank Since
    March  however military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and
    eastern Sierra Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined
    efforts to institute economic reforms
