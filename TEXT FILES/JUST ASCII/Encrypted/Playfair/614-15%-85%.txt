    undeveloped agricultural south dominated by large public enterprises
    Services account for  of GDP industry about  agriculture  and
    public administration  Most raw materials needed by industry and over
     of energy requirements must be imported After growing at an annual
    average rate of  during the period  growth slowed to about  in
     For the s Italy faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering
    communications system curbing pollution in major industrial centers and
    adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic
    integration of the European Community
