an hour or so and were quite dry again the Dodo suddenly called
out The race is over and they all crowded round it panting
and asking But who has won?

  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare
in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence  At
last the Dodo said EVERYBODY has won and all must have
prizes

  But who is to give the prizes? quite a chorus of voices
asked

  Why SHE of course said the Dodo pointing to Alice with
one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her
calling out in a confused way Prizes Prizes

  Alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand
in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt
water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes
There was exactly one apiece all round

  But she must have a prize herself you know said the Mouse

  Of course the Dodo replied very gravely  What else have
you got in your pocket? he went on turning to Alice

  Only a thimble said Alice sadly

  Hand it over here said the Dodo

  Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo
solemnly presented the thimble saying We beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short
speech they all cheered

  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked
so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not
think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble
looking as solemn as she could

  The next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise
and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not
taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
the back  However it was over at last and they sat down again
in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more

  You promised to tell me your history you know said Alice
and why it is you hateC and D she added in a whisper half
afraid that it would be offended again

  Mine is a long and a sad tale said the Mouse turning to
Alice and sighing

  It IS a long tail certainly said Alice looking down with
wonder at the Mouses tail but why do you call it sad?  And
she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking so
that her idea of the tale was something like this

                    Fury said to a
                   mouse That he
                 met in the
               house
            "Let us
              both go to
                law  I will
                  prosecute
                    YOU  Come
                       Ill take no
                        denial We
                     must have a
                 trial  For
              really this
           morning Ive
          nothing
         to do"
           Said the
             mouse to the
               cur "Such
                 a trial
                   dear Sir
                         With
                     no jury
                  or judge
                would be
              wasting
             our
              breath"
               "Ill be
                 judge Ill
                   be jury"
                         Said
                    cunning
                      old Fury
                     "Ill
                      try the
                         whole
                          cause
                             and
                        condemn
                       you
                      to
                       death"


  You are not attending said the Mouse to Alice severely
What are you thinking of?

  I beg your pardon said Alice very humbly  you had got to
the fifth bend I think?

  I had NOT cried the Mouse sharply and very angrily

  A knot said Alice always ready to make herself useful and
looking anxiously about her  Oh do let me help to undo it

  I shall do nothing of the sort said the Mouse getting up
and walking away  You insult me by talking LHRM WURLARPS
