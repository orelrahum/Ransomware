Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
Powdered with stars  And now on Earth the seventh
Evening arose in Eden for the sun
Was set and twilight from the east came on
Forerunning night when at the holy mount
Of Heavens highseated top the imperial throne
Of Godhead fixed for ever firm and sure
The Filial Power arrived and sat him down
With his great Father for he also went
Invisible yet staid such privilege
Hath Omnipresence and the work ordained
Author and End of all things and from work
Now resting blessed and hallowed the seventh day
As resting on that day from all his work
But not in silence holy kept the harp
Had work and rested not the solemn pipe
And dulcimer all organs of sweet stop
All sounds on fret by string or golden wire
Tempered soft tunings intermixed with voice
Choral or unison of incense clouds
Fuming from golden censers hid the mount
Creation and the six days acts they sung
Great are thy works Jehovah infinite
Thy power what thought can measure thee or tongue
Relate thee  Greater now in thy return
Than from the giant Angels  Thee that day
Thy thunders magnified but to create
Is greater than created to destroy
Who can impair thee Mighty King or bound
Thy empire  Easily the proud attempt
Of Spirits apostate and their counsels vain
Thou hast repelled while impiously they thought
Thee to diminish and from thee withdraw
The number of thy worshippers  Who seeks
To lessen thee against his purpose serves
To manifest the more thy might his evil
Thou usest and from thence createst more good
Witness this newmade world another Heaven
From Heavengate not far founded in view
On the clear hyaline the glassy sea
Of amplitude almost immense with stars
Numerous and every star perhaps a world
Of destined habitation but thou knowest
Their seasons among these the seat of Men
Earth with her nether ocean circumfused
Their pleasant dwellingplace  Thrice happy Men
And sons of Men whom God hath thus advanced
Created in his image there to dwell
And worship him and in reward to rule
Over his works on earth in sea or air
And multiply a race of worshippers
Holy and just  Thrice happy if they know
Their happiness and persevere upright
So sung they and the empyrean rung
With halleluiahs  Thus was sabbath kept
And thy request think now fulfilled that asked
How first this world and face of things began
And what before thy memory was done
From the beginning that posterity
Informed by thee might know  If else thou seekest
Aught not surpassing human measure say



Book VIII


The Angel ended and in Adams ear
So charming left his voice that he a while
Thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear
Then as new waked thus gratefully replied
What thanks sufficient or what recompence
Equal have I to render thee divine
Historian who thus largely hast allayed
The thirst I had of knowledge and vouchsafed
This friendly condescension to relate
Things else by me unsearchable now heard
With wonder but delight and as is due
With glory attributed to the high
Creator  Something yet of doubt remains
Which only thy solution can resolve
When I behold this goodly frame this world
Of Heaven and Earth consisting and compute
Their magnitudes this Earth a spot a grain
An atom with the firmament compared
And all her numbered stars that seem to roll
Spaces incomprehensible for such
Their distance argues and their swift return
Diurnal merely to officiate light
Round this opacous Earth this punctual spot
One day and night in all her vast survey
Useless besides reasoning I oft admire
How Nature wise and frugal could commit
Such disproportions with superfluous hand
So many nobler bodies to create
Greater so manifold to this one use
For aught appears and on their orbs impose
Such restless revolution day by day
Repeated while the sedentary Earth
That better might with far less compass move
Served by more noble than herself attains
Her end without least motion and receives
As tribute such a sumless journey brought
Of incorporeal speed her warmth and light
Speed to describe whose swiftness number fails
So spake our sire and by his countenance seemed
Entering on studious thoughts abstruse which Eve
Perceiving where she sat retired in sight
With lowliness majestick from her seat
And grace that won who saw to wish her stay
Rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers
To visit how they prospered bud and bloom
Her nursery they at her coming sprung
And touched by her fair tendance gladlier grew
Yet went she not as not with such discourse
Delighted or not capable her ear
Of what was high such pleasure she reserved
Adam relating she sole auditress
Her husband the relater she preferred
Before the Angel and of him to ask
Chose rather he she knew would intermix
Grateful digressions and solve high dispute
With conjugal caresses from his lip
Not words alone pleased her  O when meet now
Such pairs in love and mutual honour joined?
With Goddesslike demeanour forth she went
Not unattended for on her as Queen
A pomp of winning Graces waited still
And from about her shot darts of desire
Into all eyes to wish her still in sight
And Raphael now to Adams doubt proposed
Benevolent and facile thus replied
To ask or search I blame thee not for Heaven
Is as the book of God before thee set
Wherein to read his wonderous works and learn
His seasons hours or days or months or years
This to attain whether Heaven move or Earth
Imports not if thou reckon right the rest
From Man or Angel the great Architect
Did wisely to conceal and not divulge
His secrets to be scanned by them who ought
Rather admire or if they list to try
Conjecture he his fabrick of the Heavens
Hath left to their disputes perhaps to move
His laughter at their quaint opinions wide
Hereafter when they come to model Heaven
And calculate the stars how they will wield
The mighty frame how build unbuild contrive
To save appearances how gird the sphere
With centrick and eccentrick scribbled oer
Cycle and epicycle orb in orb
Already by thy reasoning this I guess
Who art to lead thy offspring and supposest
That bodies bright and greater should not serve
The less not bright nor Heaven such journeys run
Earth sitting still when she alone receives
The benefit  Consider first that great
Or bright infers not excellence the Earth
Though in comparison of Heaven so small
Nor glistering may of solid good contain
More plenty than the sun that barren shines
Whose virtue on itself works no effect
But in the fruitful Earth there first received
His beams unactive else their vigour find
Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries
Officious but to thee Earths habitant
And for the Heavens wide circuit let it speak
The Makers high magnificence who built
So spacious and his line stretched out so far
That Man may know he dwells not in his own
An edifice too large for him to fill
Lodged in a small partition and the rest
Ordained for uses to his Lord best known
The swiftness of those circles attribute
Though numberless to his Omnipotence
That to corporeal substances could add
Speed almost spiritual  Me thou thinkest not slow
Who since the morninghour set out from Heaven
Where God resides and ere midday arrived
In Eden distance inexpressible
By numbers that have name  But this I urge
Admitting motion in the Heavens to show
Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved
Not that I so affirm though so it seem
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth
God to remove his ways from human sense
Placed Heaven from Earth so far that earthly sight
If it presume might err in things too high
And no advantage gain  What if the sun
Be center to the world and other stars
By his attractive virtue and their own
Incited dance about him various rounds?
Their wandering course now high now low then hid
Progressive retrograde or standing still
In six thou seest and what if seventh to these
The planet earth so stedfast though she seem
Insensibly three different motions move?
Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe
Moved contrary with thwart obliquities
Or save the sun his labour and that swift
Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed
Invisible else above all stars the wheel
Of day and night which needs not thy belief
If earth industrious of herself fetch day
Travelling east and with her part averse
From the suns beam meet night her other part
Still luminous by his ray  What if that light
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air
To the terrestrial moon be as a star
Enlightening her by day as she by night
This earth? reciprocal if land be there
Fields and inhabitants  Her spots thou seest
As clouds and clouds may rain and rain produce
Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat
Allotted there and other suns perhaps
With their attendant moons thou wilt descry
Communicating male and female light
Which two great sexes animate the world
Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed
By living soul desart and desolate
Only to shine yet scarce to contribute
Each orb a glimpse of light conveyed so far
Down to this habitable which returns
Light back to them is obvious to dispute
But whether thus these things or whether not
But whether the sun predominant in Heaven
Rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun
He from the east his flaming road begin
Or she from west her silent course advance
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
On her soft axle while she paces even
And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid
Leave them to God above him serve and fear
Of other creatures as him pleases best
Wherever placed let him dispose joy thou
In what he gives to thee this Paradise
And thy fair Eve Heaven is for thee too high
To know what passes there be lowly wise
Think only what concerns thee and thy being
Dream not of other worlds what creatures there
Live in what state condition or degree
Contented that thus far hath been revealed
Not of Earth only but of highest Heaven
To whom thus Adam cleared of doubt replied
How fully hast thou satisfied me pure
Intelligence of Heaven Angel serene
And freed from intricacies taught to live
The easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts
To interrupt the sweet of life from which
God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares
And not molest us unless we ourselves
Seek them with wandering thoughts and notions vain
But apt the mind or fancy is to rove
Unchecked and of her roving is no end
Till warned or by experience taught she learn
That not to know at large of things remote
From use obscure and subtle but to know
That which before us lies in daily life
Is the prime wisdom  What is more is fume
Or emptiness or fond impertinence
And renders us in things that most concern
Unpractised unprepared and still to seek
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
A lower flight and speak of things at hand
Useful whence haply mention may arise
Of something not unseasonable to ask
By sufferance and thy wonted favour deigned
Thee I have heard relating what was done
Ere my remembrance now hear me relate
My story which perhaps thou hast not heard
And day is not yet spent till then thou seest
How subtly to detain thee I devise
Inviting thee to hear while I relate
Fond were it not in hope of thy reply
For while I sit with thee I seem in Heaven
And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear
Than fruits of palmtree pleasantest to thirst
And hunger both from labour at the hour
Of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill
Though pleasant but thy words with grace divine
Imbued bring to their sweetness no satiety
To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek
Nor are thy lips ungraceful Sire of men
Nor tongue ineloquent for God on thee
Abundantly his gifts hath also poured
Inward and outward both his image fair
Speaking or mute all comeliness and grace
Attends thee and each word each motion forms
Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth
Than of our fellowservant and inquire
Gladly into the ways of God with Man
For God we see hath honoured thee and set
On Man his equal love  Say therefore on
For I that day was absent as befel
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure
Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell
Squared in full legion such command we had
To see that none thence issued forth a spy
Or enemy while God was in his work
Lest he incensed at such eruption bold
Destruction with creation might have mixed
Not that they durst without his leave attempt
But us he sends upon his high behests
For state as Sovran King and to inure
Our prompt obedience  Fast we found fast shut
The dismal gates and barricadoed strong
But long ere our approaching heard within
Noise other than the sound of dance or song
Torment and loud lament and furious rage
Glad we returned up to the coasts of light
Ere sabbathevening so we had in charge
But thy relation now for I attend
Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine
So spake the Godlike Power and thus our Sire
For Man to tell how human life began
Is hard for who himself beginning knew
Desire with thee still longer to converse
Induced me  As new waked from soundest sleep
Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid
In balmy sweat which with his beams the sun
Soon dried and on the reeking moisture fed
Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned
And gazed a while the ample sky till raised
By quick instinctive motion up I sprung
As thitherward endeavouring and upright
Stood on my feet about me round I saw
Hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains
And liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these
Creatures that lived and moved and walked or flew
Birds on the branches warbling all things smiled
With fragrance and with joy my heart oerflowed
Myself I then perused and limb by limb
Surveyed and sometimes went and sometimes ran
With supple joints as lively vigour led
But who I was or where or from what cause
Knew not to speak I tried and forthwith spake
My tongue obeyed and readily could name
Whateer I saw  Thou Sun said I fair light
And thou enlightened Earth so fresh and gay
Ye Hills and Dales ye Rivers Woods and Plains
And ye that live and move fair Creatures tell
Tell if ye saw how I came thus how here?
Not of myselfby some great Maker then
In goodness and in power preeminent
Tell me how may I know him how adore
From whom I have that thus I move and live
And feel that I am happier than I know
While thus I called and strayed I knew not whither
From where I first drew air and first beheld
This happy light when answer none returned
On a green shady bank profuse of flowers
Pensive I sat me down  There gentle sleep
First found me and with soft oppression seised
My droused sense untroubled though I thought
I then was passing to my former state
Insensible and forthwith to dissolve
When suddenly stood at my head a dream
Whose inward apparition gently moved
My fancy to believe I yet had being
And lived  One came methought of shape divine
And said Thy mansion wants thee Adam rise
First Man of men innumerable ordained
First Father called by thee I come thy guide
To the garden of bliss thy seat prepared
So saying by the hand he took me raised
And over fields and waters as in air
Smoothsliding without step last led me up
A woody mountain whose high top was plain
A circuit wide enclosed with goodliest trees
Planted with walks and bowers that what I saw
Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed  Each tree
Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye
Tempting stirred in me sudden appetite
To pluck and eat whereat I waked and found
Before mine eyes all real as the dream
Had lively shadowed  Here had new begun
My wandering had not he who was my guide
Up hither from among the trees appeared
Presence Divine  Rejoicing but with awe
In adoration at his feet I fell
Submiss  He reared me and Whom thou soughtest I am
Said mildly Author of all this thou seest
Above or round about thee or beneath
This Paradise I give thee count it thine
To till and keep and of the fruit to eat
Of every tree that in the garden grows
Eat freely with glad heart fear here no dearth
But of the tree whose operation brings
Knowledge of good and ill which I have set
The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith
Amid the garden by the tree of life
Remember what I warn thee shun to taste
And shun the bitter consequence for know
The day thou eatest thereof my sole command
Transgressed inevitably thou shalt die
From that day mortal and this happy state
Shalt lose expelled from hence into a world
Of woe and sorrow  Sternly he pronounced
The rigid interdiction which resounds
Yet dreadful in mine ear though in my choice
Not to incur but soon his clear aspect
Returned and gracious purpose thus renewed
Not only these fair bounds but all the Earth
To thee and to thy race I give as lords
Possess it and all things that therein live
Or live in sea or air beast fish and fowl
In sign whereof each bird and beast behold
After their kinds I bring them to receive
From thee their names and pay thee fealty
With low subjection understand the same
Of fish within their watery residence
Not hither summoned since they cannot change
Their element to draw the thinner air
As thus he spake each bird and beast behold
Approaching two and two these cowering low
With blandishment each bird stooped on his wing
I named them as they passed and understood
Their nature with such knowledge God endued
My sudden apprehension  But in these
I found not what methought I wanted still
And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed
O by what name for thou above all these
Above mankind or aught than mankind higher
Surpassest far my naming how may I
Adore thee Author of this universe
And all this good to man? for whose well being
So amply and with hands so liberal
Thou hast provided all things  But with me
I see not who partakes  In solitude
What happiness who can enjoy alone
Or all enjoying what contentment find?
Thus I presumptuous and the Vision bright
As with a smile more brightened thus replied
What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth
With various living creatures and the air
Replenished and all these at thy command
To come and play before thee?  Knowest thou not
Their language and their ways?  They also know
And reason not contemptibly  With these
Find pastime and bear rule thy realm is large
So spake the Universal Lord and seemed
So ordering  I with leave of speech implored
And humble deprecation thus replied
Let not my words offend thee Heavenly Power
My Maker be propitious while I speak
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute
And these inferiour far beneath me set?
Among unequals what society
Can sort what harmony or true delight?
Which must be mutual in proportion due
Given and received but in disparity
The one intense the other still remiss
Cannot well suit with either but soon prove
Tedious alike  Of fellowship I speak
Such as I seek fit to participate
All rational delight wherein the brute
Cannot be human consort  They rejoice
Each with their kind lion with lioness
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined
Much less can bird with beast or fish with fowl
So well converse nor with the ox the ape
Worse then can man with beast and least of all
Whereto the Almighty answered not displeased
A nice and subtle happiness I see
Thou to thyself proposest in the choice
Of thy associates Adam and wilt taste
No pleasure though in pleasure solitary
What thinkest thou then of me and this my state?
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed
Of happiness or not? who am alone
From all eternity for none I know
Second to me or like equal much less
How have I then with whom to hold converse
Save with the creatures which I made and those
To me inferiour infinite descents
Beneath what other creatures are to thee?
He ceased I lowly answered  To attain
The highth and depth of thy eternal ways
All human thoughts come short Supreme of things
Thou in thyself art perfect and in thee
Is no deficience found  Not so is Man
But in degree the cause of his desire
By conversation with his like to help
Or solace his defects  No need that thou
Shouldst propagate already Infinite
And through all numbers absolute though One
But Man by number is to manifest
His single imperfection and beget
Like of his like his image multiplied
In unity defective which requires
Collateral love and dearest amity
Thou in thy secresy although alone
Best with thyself accompanied seekest not
Social communication yet so pleased
Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt
Of union or communion deified
I by conversing cannot these erect
From prone nor in their ways complacence find
Thus I emboldened spake and freedom used
Permissive and acceptance found which gained
This answer from the gracious Voice Divine
Thus far to try thee Adam I was pleased
And find thee knowing not of beasts alone
Which thou hast rightly named but of thyself
Expressing well the spirit within thee free
My image not imparted to the brute
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike
And be so minded still  I ere thou spakest
Knew it not good for Man to be alone
And no such company as then thou sawest
Intended thee for trial only brought
To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet
What next I bring shall please thee be assured
Thy likeness thy fit help thy other self
Thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire
He ended or I heard no more for now
My earthly by his heavenly overpowered
Which it had long stood under strained to the highth
In that celestial colloquy sublime
As with an object that excels the sense
Dazzled and spent sunk down and sought repair
Of sleep which instantly fell on me called
By Nature as in aid and closed mine eyes
Mine eyes he closed but open left the cell
Of fancy my internal sight by which
Abstract as in a trance methought I saw
Though sleeping where I lay and saw the shape
Still glorious before whom awake I stood
Who stooping opened my left side and took
From thence a rib with cordial spirits warm
And lifeblood streaming fresh wide was the wound
But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed
The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands
Under his forming hands a creature grew
Manlike but different sex so lovely fair
That what seemed fair in all the world seemed now
Mean or in her summed up in her contained
And in her looks which from that time infused
Sweetness into my heart unfelt before
And into all things from her air inspired
The spirit of love and amorous delight
She disappeared and left me dark I waked
To find her or for ever to deplore
Her loss and other pleasures all abjuNY
