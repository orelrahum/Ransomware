Sao Tome and Principe Economy

Overview
    The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
    independence nearly  years ago Since then however cocoa production has
    gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement so that by 
    output had fallen to less than  of its former levels As a result a
    shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balanceofpayments
    problem Production of less important crops such as coffee copra and palm
    kernels has also declined The value of imports generally exceeds that of
    exports by a ratio of  The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
    of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import  of food needs
    It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods Over the years
    Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt which amounts to
    roughly  of export earnings Considerable potential exists for
    development of a tourist industry and the government has taken steps to
    expand facilities in recent years The government also implemented a
    FiveYear Plan covering  to restructure the economy and reschedule
    external debt service payments in cooperation with the International
    Development Association and Western lenders
