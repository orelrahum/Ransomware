Sweden Economy

Overview
    Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I through
    World War II Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
    mixed system of hightech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits It has
    essentially full employment a modern distribution system excellent
    internal and external communications and a skilled labor force Timber
    hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is
    heavily oriented toward foreign trade Privately owned firms account for
    about  of industrial output of which the engineering sector accounts for
     of output and exports In the last few years however this
    extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by inflation growing
    absenteeism and a gradual loss of competitiveness in international markets
    The new centerright government facing a sagging economic situation which
    is unlikely to improve until  is pushing full steam ahead with economic
    reform proposals to end Swedens recession and to prepare for possible EC
    membership in  The freemarketoriented reforms are designed to spur
    growth maintain price stability lower unemployment create a more
    efficient welfare state and further adapt to EC standards The measures
    include cutting taxes particularly the valueadded tax VAT and levies on
    new and small business privatization liberalizing foreign ownership
    restrictions and opening the welfare system to competition and private
    alternatives which the government will still finance Growth is expected to
    remain flat in  but increase slightly in  while inflation should
    remain around  for the next few years On the down side unemployment may
    climb to slightly over  in  and the budget deficit will reach nearly
