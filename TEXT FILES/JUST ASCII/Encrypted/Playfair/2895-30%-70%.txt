	I had rather hear you chide than this man woo

ROSALIND	Hes fallen in love with your foulness and shell
	fall in love with my anger If it be so as fast as
	she answers thee with frowning looks Ill sauce her
	with bitter words Why look you so upon me?

PHEBE	For no ill will I bear you

ROSALIND	I pray you do not fall in love with me
	For I am falser than vows made in wine
	Besides I like you not If you will know my house
	Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by
	Will you go sister? Shepherd ply her hard
	Come sister Shepherdess look on him better
	And be not proud though all the world could see
	None could be so abused in sight as he
	Come to our flock

	Exeunt ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN

PHEBE	Dead Shepherd now I find thy saw of might
	Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe

PHEBE	                  Ha what sayst thou Silvius?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe pity me

PHEBE	Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius

SILVIUS	Wherever sorrow is relief would be
	If you do sorrow at my grief in love
	By giving love your sorrow and my grief
	Were both extermined

PHEBE	Thou hast my love is not that neighbourly?

SILVIUS	I would have you

PHEBE	                  Why that were covetousness
	Silvius the time was that I hated thee
	And yet it is not that I bear thee love
	But since that thou canst talk of love so well
	Thy company which erst was irksome to me
	I will endure and Ill employ thee too
	But do not look for further recompense
	Than thine own gladness that thou art employd

SILVIUS	So holy and so perfect is my love
	And I in such a poverty of grace
	That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
	To glean the broken ears after the man
	That the main harvest reaps loose now and then
	A scatterd smile and that Ill live upon

PHEBE	Knowst now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

SILVIUS	Not very well but I have met him oft
	And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
	That the old carlot once was master of

PHEBE	Think not I love him though I ask for him
	Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
	But what care I for words? yet words do well
	When he that speaks them pleases those that hear
	It is a pretty youth not very pretty
	But sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him
	Hell make a proper man the best thing in him
	Is his complexion and faster than his tongue
	Did make offence his eye did heal it up
	He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall
	His leg is but so so and yet tis well
	There was a pretty redness in his lip
	A little riper and more lusty red
	Than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference
	Between the constant red and mingled damask
	There be some women Silvius had they markd him
	In parcels as I did would have gone near
	To fall in love with him but for my part
	I love him not nor hate him not and yet
	I have more cause to hate him than to love him
	For what had he to do to chide at me?
	He said mine eyes were black and my hair black
	And now I am rememberd scornd at me
	I marvel why I answerd not again
	But thats all one omittance is no quittance
	Ill write to him a very taunting letter
	And thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius?

SILVIUS	Phebe with all my heart

PHEBE	Ill write it straight
	The matters in my head and in my heart
	I will be bitter with him and passing short
	Go with me Silvius

	Exeunt




	AS YOU LIKE IT
