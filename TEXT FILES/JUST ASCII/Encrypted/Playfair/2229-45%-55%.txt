And with Asphaltick slime broad as the gate
Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach
They fastened and the mole immense wrought on
Over the foaming deep higharched a bridge
Of length prodigious joining to the wall
Immoveable of this now fenceless world
Forfeit to Death from hence a passage broad
Smooth easy inoffensive down to Hell
So if great things to small may be compared
Xerxes the liberty of Greece to yoke
From Susa his Memnonian palace high
Came to the sea and over Hellespont
Bridging his way Europe with Asia joined
And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves
Now had they brought the work by wonderous art
Pontifical a ridge of pendant rock
Over the vexed abyss following the track
Of Satan to the selfsame place where he
First lighted from his wing and landed safe
From out of Chaos to the outside bare
Of this round world  With pins of adamant
And chains they made all fast too fast they made
And durable  And now in little space
The confines met of empyrean Heaven
And of this World and on the left hand Hell
With long reach interposed three several ways
In sight to each of these three places led
And now their way to Earth they had descried
To Paradise first tending when behold
Satan in likeness of an Angel bright
Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering
His zenith while the sun in Aries rose
Disguised he came but those his children dear
Their parent soon discerned though in disguise
He after Eve seduced unminded slunk
Into the wood fast by and changing shape
To observe the sequel saw his guileful act
By Eve though all unweeting seconded
Upon her husband saw their shame that sought
Vain covertures but when he saw descend
The Son of God to judge them terrified
He fled not hoping to escape but shun
The present fearing guilty what his wrath
Might suddenly inflict that past returned
By night and listening where the hapless pair
Sat in their sad discourse and various plaint
Thence gathered his own doom which understood
Not instant but of future time with joy
And tidings fraught to Hell he now returned
And at the brink of Chaos near the foot
Of this new wonderous pontifice unhoped
Met who to meet him came his offspring dear
Great joy was at their meeting and at sight
Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased
Long he admiring stood till Sin his fair
Enchanting daughter thus the silence broke
O Parent these are thy magnifick deeds
Thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own
Thou art their author and prime architect
For I no sooner in my heart divined
My heart which by a secret harmony
Still moves with thine joined in connexion sweet
That thou on earth hadst prospered which thy looks
Now also evidence but straight I felt
Though distant from thee worlds between yet felt
That I must after thee DOPM PMHV PME XUW
