CORIN	                  Else are they very wretched

ROSALIND	Peace I say Good even to you friend

CORIN	And to you gentle sir and to you all

ROSALIND	I prithee shepherd if that love or gold
	Can in this desert place buy entertainment
	Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
	Heres a young maid with travel much oppressd
	And faints for succor

CORIN	Fair sir I pity her
	And wish for her sake more than for mine own
	My fortunes were more able to relieve her
	But I am shepherd to another man
	And do not shear the fleeces that I graze
	My master is of churlish disposition
	And little recks to find the way to heaven
	By doing deeds of hospitality
	Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
	Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
	By reason of his absence there is nothing
	That you will feed on but what is come see
	And in my voice most welcome shall you be

ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

CORIN	That young swain that you saw here but erewhile
	That little cares for buying any thing

ROSALIND	I pray thee if it stand with honesty
	Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
	And thou shalt have to pay for it of us

CELIA	And we will mend thy wages I like this place
	And willingly WMNFR DELPQ OQ GMHQ UD MG
