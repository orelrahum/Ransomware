    State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist

    strict rule of KIM Ilsong and his son KIM Chongil Economic growth during
    the period  averaged  but output declined by  annually
    during  largely because of disruptions in economic relations with
    the USSR Abundant natural resources and hydropower form the basis of

    coupled with distribution problems have led to chronic food shortages
