One Spirit in them ruled and every eye
Glared lightning and shot forth pernicious fire
Among the accursed that withered all their strength
And of their wonted vigour left them drained
Exhausted spiritless afflicted fallen
Yet half his strength he put not forth but checked
His thunder in mid volley for he meant
Not to destroy but root them out of Heaven
The overthrown he raised and as a herd
Of goats or timorous flock together thronged
Drove them before him thunderstruck pursued
With terrours and with furies to the bounds
And crystal wall of Heaven which opening wide
Rolled inward and a spacious gap disclosed
Into the wasteful deep  The monstrous sight
Struck them with horrour backward but far worse
Urged them behind  Headlong themselves they threw
Down from the verge of Heaven eternal wrath
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit
Hell heard the unsufferable noise Hell saw
Heaven ruining from Heaven and would have fled
Affrighted but strict Fate had cast too deep
Her dark foundations and too fast had bound
Nine days they fell  Confounded Chaos roared
And felt tenfold confusion in their fall
Through his wild anarchy so huge a rout
Incumbered him with ruin  Hell at last
Yawning received them whole and on them closed
Hell their fit habitation fraught with fire
Unquenchable the house of woe and pain
Disburdened Heaven rejoiced and soon repaired
Her mural breach returning whence it rolled
Sole victor from the expulsion of his foes
Messiah his triumphal chariot turned
To meet him all his Saints who silent stood
Eyewitnesses of his almighty acts
With jubilee advanced and as they went
Shaded with branching palm each Order bright
Sung triumph and him sung victorious King
Son Heir and Lord to him dominion given
Worthiest to reign  He celebrated rode
Triumphant through mid Heaven into the courts
And temple of his Mighty Father throned
On high who into glory him received
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss
Thus measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth
At thy request and that thou mayest beware
By what is past to thee I have revealed
What might have else to human race been hid
The discord which befel and war in Heaven
Among the angelick Powers and the deep fall
Of those too high aspiring who rebelled
With Satan he who envies now thy state
Who now is plotting how he may seduce
Thee also from obedience that with him
Bereaved of happiness thou mayest partake
His punishment eternal misery
Which would be all his solace and revenge
As a despite done against the Most High
Thee once to gain companion of his woe
But listen not to his temptations warn
Thy weaker let it profit thee to have heard
By terrible example the reward
Of disobedience firm they might have stood
Yet fell remember and fear to transgress



Book VII


Descend from Heaven Urania by that name
If rightly thou art called whose voice divine
Following above the Olympian hill I soar
Above the flight of Pegasean wing
The meaning not the name I call for thou
Nor of the Muses nine nor on the top
Of old Olympus dwellest but heavenlyborn
Before the hills appeared or fountain flowed
Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse
Wisdom thy sister and with her didst play
In presence of the Almighty Father pleased
With thy celestial song  Up led by thee
Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed
An earthly guest and drawn empyreal air
Thy tempering with like safety guided down
Return me to my native element
Lest from this flying steed unreined as once
Bellerophon though from a lower clime
Dismounted on the Aleian field I fall
Erroneous there to wander and forlorn
Half yet remains unsung but narrower bound
Within the visible diurnal sphere
Standing on earth not rapt above the pole
More safe I sing with mortal voice unchanged
To hoarse or mute though fallen on evil days
On evil days though fallen and evil tongues
In darkness and with dangers compassed round
And solitude yet not alone while thou
Visitest my slumbers nightly or when morn
Purples the east still govern thou my song
Urania and fit audience find though few
But drive far off the barbarous dissonance
Of Bacchus and his revellers the race
Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard
In Rhodope where woods and rocks had ears
To rapture till the savage clamour drowned
Both harp and voice nor could the Muse defend
Her son  So fail not thou who thee implores
For thou art heavenly she an empty dream
Say Goddess what ensued when Raphael
The affable ArchAngel had forewarned
Adam by dire example to beware
Apostasy by what befel in Heaven
To those apostates lest the like befall
In Paradise to Adam or his race
Charged not to touch the interdicted tree
If they transgress and slight that sole command
So easily obeyed amid the choice
Of all tastes else to please their appetite
Though wandering  He with his consorted Eve
The story heard attentive and was filled
With admiration and deep muse to hear
Of things so high and strange things to their thought
So unimaginable as hate in Heaven
And war so near the peace of God in bliss
With such confusion but the evil soon
Driven back redounded as a flood on those
From whom it sprung impossible to mix
With blessedness  Whence Adam soon repealed
The doubts that in his heart arose and now
Led on yet sinless with desire to know
What nearer might concern him how this world
Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began
When and whereof created for what cause
What within Eden or without was done
Before his memory as one whose drouth
Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites
Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest
Great things and full of wonder in our ears
Far differing from this world thou hast revealed
Divine interpreter by favour sent
Down from the empyrean to forewarn
Us timely of what might else have been our loss
Unknown which human knowledge could not reach
For which to the infinitely Good we owe
Immortal thanks and his admonishment
Receive with solemn purpose to observe
Immutably his sovran will the end
Of what we are  But since thou hast vouchsafed
Gently for our instruction to impart
Things above earthly thought which yet concerned
Our knowing as to highest wisdom seemed
Deign to descend now lower and relate
What may no less perhaps avail us known
How first began this Heaven which we behold
Distant so high with moving fires adorned
Innumerable and this which yields or fills
All space the ambient air wide interfused
Embracing round this floried Earth what cause
Moved the Creator in his holy rest
Through all eternity so late to build
In Chaos and the work begun how soon
Absolved if unforbid thou mayest unfold
What we not to explore the secrets ask
Of his eternal empire but the more
To magnify his works the more we know
And the great light of day yet wants to run
Much of his race though steep suspense in Heaven
Held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears
And longer will delay to hear thee tell
His generation and the rising birth
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep
Or if the star of evening and the moon
Haste to thy audience Night with her will bring
Silence and Sleep listening to thee will watch
Or we can bid his absence till thy song
End and dismiss thee ere the morning shine
Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought
And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild
This also thy request with caution asked
Obtain though to recount almighty works
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
Yet what thou canst attain which best may serve
To glorify the Maker and infer
Thee also happier shall not be withheld
Thy hearing such commission from above
I have received to answer thy desire
Of knowledge within bounds beyond abstain
To ask nor let thine own inventions hope
Things not revealed which the invisible King
Only Omniscient hath suppressed in night
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven
Enough is left besides to search and know
But knowledge is as food and needs no less
Her temperance over appetite to know
In measure what the mind may well contain
Oppresses else with surfeit and soon turns
Wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind
Know then that after Lucifer from Heaven
So call him brighter once amidst the host
Of Angels than that star the stars among
Fell with his flaming legions through the deep
Into his place and the great Son returned
Victorious with his Saints the Omnipotent
Eternal Father from his throne beheld
Their multitude and to his Son thus spake
At least our envious Foe hath failed who thought
All like himself rebellious by whose aid
This inaccessible high strength the seat
Of Deity supreme us dispossessed
He trusted to have seised and into fraud
Drew many whom their place knows here no more
Yet far the greater part have kept I see
Their station Heaven yet populous retains
Number sufficient to possess her realms
Though wide and this high temple to frequent
With ministeries due and solemn rites
But lest his heart exalt him in the harm
Already done to have dispeopled Heaven
My damage fondly deemed I can repair
That detriment if such it be to lose
Selflost and in a moment will create
Another world out of one man a race
Of men innumerable there to dwell
Not here till by degrees of merit raised
They open to themselves at length the way
Up hither under long obedience tried
And Earth be changed to Heaven and Heaven to Earth
One kingdom joy and union without end
Mean while inhabit lax ye Powers of Heaven
And thou my Word begotten Son by thee
This I perform speak thou and be it done
My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee
I send along ride forth and bid the Deep
Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth
Boundless the Deep because I Am who fill
Infinitude nor vacuous the space
Though I uncircumscribed myself retire
And put not forth my goodness which is free
To act or not Necessity and Chance
Approach not me and what I will is Fate
So spake the Almighty and to what he spake
His Word the Filial Godhead gave effect
Immediate are the acts of God more swift
Than time or motion but to human ears
Cannot without process of speech be told
So told as earthly notion can receive
Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven
When such was heard declared the Almightys will
Glory they sung to the Most High good will
To future men and in their dwellings peace
Glory to Him whose just avenging ire
Had driven out the ungodly from his sight
And the habitations of the just to Him
Glory and praise whose wisdom had ordained
Good out of evil to create instead
Of Spirits malign a better race to bring
Into their vacant room and thence diffuse
His good to worlds and ages infinite
So sang the Hierarchies  Mean while the Son
On his great expedition now appeared
Girt with Omnipotence with radiance crowned
Of Majesty Divine sapience and love
Immense and all his Father in him shone
About his chariot numberless were poured
Cherub and Seraph Potentates and Thrones
And Virtues winged Spirits and chariots winged
From the armoury of God where stand of old
Myriads between two brazen mountains lodged
Against a solemn day harnessed at hand
Celestial equipage and now came forth
Spontaneous for within them Spirit lived
Attendant on their Lord  Heaven opened wide
Her everduring gates harmonious sound
On golden hinges moving to let forth
The King of Glory in his powerful Word
And Spirit coming to create new worlds
On heavenly ground they stood and from the shore
They viewed the vast immeasurable abyss
Outrageous as a sea dark wasteful wild
Up from the bottom turned by furious winds
And surging waves as mountains to assault
Heavens highth and with the center mix the pole
Silence ye troubled Waves and thou Deep peace
Said then the Omnifick Word your discord end
Nor staid but on the wings of Cherubim
Uplifted in paternal glory rode
Far into Chaos and the world unborn
For Chaos heard his voice  Him all his train
Followed in bright procession to behold
Creation and the wonders of his might
Then staid the fervid wheels and in his hand
He took the golden compasses prepared
In Gods eternal store to circumscribe
This universe and all created things
One foot he centered and the other turned
Round through the vast profundity obscure
And said Thus far extend thus far thy bounds
This be thy just circumference O World
Thus God the Heaven created thus the Earth
Matter unformed and void  Darkness profound
Covered the abyss but on the watery calm
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread
And vital virtue infused and vital warmth
Throughout the fluid mass but downward purged
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs
Adverse to life then founded then conglobed
Like things to like the rest to several place
Disparted and between spun out the air
And Earth selfbalanced on her center hung
Let there be light said God and forthwith Light
Ethereal first of things quintessence pure
Sprung from the deep and from her native east
To journey through the aery gloom began
Sphered in a radiant cloud for yet the sun
Was not she in a cloudy tabernacle
Sojourned the while  God saw the light was good
And light from darkness by the hemisphere
Divided light the Day and darkness Night
He named  Thus was the first day even and morn
Nor past uncelebrated nor unsung
By the celestial quires when orient light
Exhaling first from darkness they beheld
Birthday of Heaven and Earth with joy and shout
The hollow universal orb they filled
And touched their golden harps and hymning praised
God and his works Creator him they sung
Both when first evening was and when first morn
Again God said  Let there be firmament
Amid the waters and let it divide
The waters from the waters and God made
The firmament expanse of liquid pure
Transparent elemental air diffused
In circuit to the uttermost convex
Of this great round partition firm and sure
The waters underneath from those above
Dividing for as earth so he the world
Built on circumfluous waters calm in wide
Crystalline ocean and the loud misrule
Of Chaos far removed lest fierce extremes
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame
And Heaven he named the Firmament  So even
And morning chorus sung the second day
The Earth was formed but in the womb as yet
Of waters embryon immature involved
Appeared not over all the face of Earth
Main ocean flowed not idle but with warm
Prolifick humour softening all her globe
Fermented the great mother to conceive
Satiate with genial moisture when God said
Be gathered now ye waters under Heaven
Into one place and let dry land appear
Immediately the mountains huge appear
Emergent and their broad bare backs upheave
Into the clouds their tops ascend the sky
So high as heaved the tumid hills so low
Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep
Capacious bed of waters  Thither they
Hasted with glad precipitance uprolled
As drops on dust conglobing from the dry
Part rise in crystal wall or ridge direct
For haste such flight the great command impressed
On the swift floods  As armies at the call
Of trumpet for of armies thou hast heard
Troop to their standard so the watery throng
Wave rolling after wave where way they found
If steep with torrent rapture if through plain
Softebbing nor withstood them rock or hill
But they or under ground or circuit wide
With serpent errour wandering found their way
And on the washy oose deep channels wore
Easy ere God had bid the ground be dry
All but within those banks where rivers now
Stream and perpetual draw their humid train
The dry land Earth and the great receptacle
Of congregated waters he called Seas
And saw that it was good and said Let the Earth
Put forth the verdant grass herb yielding seed
And fruittree yielding fruit after her kind
Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth
He scarce had said when the bare Earth till then
Desart and bare unsightly unadorned
Brought forth the tender grass whose verdure clad
Her universal face with pleasant green
Then herbs of every leaf that sudden flowered
Opening their various colours and made gay
Her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown
Forth flourished thick the clustering vine forth crept
The swelling gourd up stood the corny reed
Embattled in her field and the humble shrub
And bush with frizzled hair implicit  Last
Rose as in dance the stately trees and spread
Their branches hung with copious fruit or gemmed
Their blossoms  With high woods the hills were crowned
With tufts the valleys and each fountain side
With borders long the rivers that Earth now
Seemed like to Heaven a seat where Gods might dwell
Or wander with delight and love to haunt
Her sacred shades though God had yet not rained
Upon the Earth and man to till the ground
None was but from the Earth a dewy mist
Went up and watered all the ground and each
Plant of the field which ere it was in the Earth
God made and every herb before it grew
On the green stem  God saw that it was good
So even and morn recorded the third day
Again the Almighty spake Let there be lights
High in the expanse of Heaven to divide
The day from night and let them be for signs
For seasons and for days and circling years
And let them be for lights as I ordain
Their office in the firmament of Heaven
To give light on the Earth and it was so
And God made two great lights great for their use
To Man the greater to have rule by day
The less by night altern and made the stars
And set them in the firmament of Heaven
To illuminate the Earth and rule the day
In their vicissitude and rule the night
And light from darkness to divide  God saw
Surveying his great work that it was good
For of celestial bodies first the sun
A mighty sphere he framed unlightsome first
Though of ethereal mould then formed the moon
Globose and every magnitude of stars
And sowed with stars the Heaven thick as a field
Of light by far the greater part he took
Transplanted from her cloudy shrine and placed
In the suns orb made porous to receive
And drink the liquid light firm to retain
Her gathered beams great palace now of light
Hither as to their fountain other stars
Repairing in their golden urns draw light
And hence the morningplanet gilds her horns
By tincture or reflection they augment
Their small peculiar though from human sight
So far remote with diminution seen
First in his east the glorious lamp was seen
Regent of day and all the horizon round
Invested with bright rays jocund to run
His longitude through Heavens high road the gray
Dawn and the Pleiades before him danced
Shedding sweet influence  Less bright the moon
But opposite in levelled west was set
His mirrour with full face borrowing her light
From him for other light she needed none
In that aspect and still that distance keeps
Till night then in the east her turn she shines
Revolved on Heavens great axle and her reign
With thousand lesser lights dividual holds
With thousand thousand stars that then appeared
Spangling the hemisphere  Then first adorned
With their bright luminaries that set and rose
Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day
And God said Let the waters generate
Reptile with spawn abundant living soul
And let fowl fly above the Earth with wings
Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven
And God created the great whales and each
Soul living each that crept which plenteously
The waters generated by their kinds
And every bird of wing after his kind
And saw that it was good and blessed them saying
Be fruitful multiply and in the seas
And lakes and running streams the waters fill
And let the fowl be multiplied on the Earth
Forthwith the sounds and seas each creek and bay
With fry innumerable swarm and shoals
Of fish that with their fins and shining scales
Glide under the green wave in sculls that oft
Bank the mid sea part single or with mate
Graze the seaweed their pasture and through groves
Of coral stray or sporting with quick glance
Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold
Or in their pearly shells at ease attend
Moist nutriment or under rocks their food
In jointed armour watch on smooth the seal
And bended dolphins play part huge of bulk
Wallowing unwieldy enormous in their gait
Tempest the ocean there leviathan
Hugest of living creatures on the deep
Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims
And seems a moving land and at his gills
Draws in and at his trunk spouts out a sea
Mean while the tepid caves and fens and shores
Their brood as numerous hatch from the egg that soon
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
Their callow young but feathered soon and fledge
They summed their pens and soaring the air sublime
With clang despised the ground under a cloud
In prospect there the eagle and the stork
On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build
Part loosely wing the region part more wise
In common ranged in figure wedge their way
Intelligent of seasons and set forth
Their aery caravan high over seas
Flying and over lands with mutual wing
Easing their flight so steers the prudent crane
Her annual voyage borne on winds the air
Floats as they pass fanned with unnumbered plumes
From branch to branch the smaller birds with song
Solaced the woods and spread their painted wings
Till even nor then the solemn nightingale
Ceased warbling but all night tund her soft lays
Others on silver lakes and rivers bathed
Their downy breast the swan with arched neck
Between her white wings mantling proudly rows
Her state with oary feet yet oft they quit
The dank and rising on stiff pennons tower
The mid aereal sky  Others on ground
Walked firm the crested cock whose clarion sounds
The silent hours and the other whose gay train
Adorns him coloured with the florid hue
Of rainbows and starry eyes  The waters thus
With fish replenished and the air with fowl
Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day
The sixth and of creation last arose
With evening harps and matin when God said
Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind
Cattle and creeping things and beast of the Earth
Each in their kind  The Earth obeyed and straight
Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth
Innumerous living creatures perfect forms
Limbed and full grown  Out of the ground up rose
As from his lair the wild beast where he wons
In forest wild in thicket brake or den
Among the trees in pairs they rose they walked
The cattle in the fields and meadows green
Those rare and solitary these in flocks
Pasturing at once and in broad herds upsprung
The grassy clods now calved now half appeared
The tawny lion pawing to get free
His hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds
And rampant shakes his brinded mane the ounce
The libbard and the tiger as the mole
Rising the crumbled earth above them threw
In hillocks  The swift stag from under ground
Bore up his branching head  Scarce from his mould
Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved
His vastness  Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose
As plants  Ambiguous between sea and land
The riverhorse and scaly crocodile
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground
Insect or worm those waved their limber fans
For wings and smallest lineaments exact
In all the liveries decked of summers pride
With spots of gold and purple azure and green
These as a line their long dimension drew
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace not all
Minims of nature some of serpentkind
Wonderous in length and corpulence involved
Their snaky folds and added wings  First crept
The parsimonious emmet provident
Of future in small room large heart enclosed
Pattern of just equality perhaps
Hereafter joined in her popular tribes
Of commonalty  Swarming next appeared
The female bee that feeds her husband drone
Deliciously and builds her waxen cells
With honey stored  The rest are numberless
And thou their natures knowest and gavest them names
Needless to thee repeated nor unknown
The serpent subtlest beast of all the field
Of huge extent sometimes with brazen eyes
And hairy mane terrifick though to thee
Not noxious but obedient at thy call
Now Heaven in all her glory shone and rolled
Her motions as the great first Movers hand
First wheeled their course  Earth in her rich attire
Consummate lovely smiled air water earth
By fowl fish beast was flown was swum was walked
Frequent and of the sixth day yet remained
There wanted yet the masterwork the end
Of all yet done a creature who not prone
And brute as other creatures but endued
With sanctity of reason might erect
His stature and upright with front serene
Govern the rest selfknowing and from thence
Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
Descends thither with heart and voice and eyes
Directed in devotion to adore
And worship God Supreme who made him chief
Of all his works  therefore the Omnipotent
Eternal Father for where is not he
Present? thus to his Son audibly spake
Let us make now Man in our image Man
In our similitude and let them rule
Over the fish and fowl of sea and air
Beast of the field and over all the Earth
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground
This said he formed thee Adam thee O Man
Dust of the ground and in thy nostrils breathed
The breath of life in his own image he
Created thee in the image of God
Express and thou becamest a living soul
Male he created thee but thy consort
Female for race then blessed mankind and said
Be fruitful multiply and fill the Earth
Subdue it and throughout dominion hold
Over fish of the sea and fowl of the air
And every living thing that moves on the Earth
Wherever thus created for no place
Is yet distinct by name thence as thou knowest
He brought thee into this delicious grove
This garden planted with the trees of God
Delectable both to behold and taste
And freely all their pleasant fruit for food
Gave thee all sorts are here that all the Earth yields
Variety without end but of the tree
Which tasted works knowledge of good and evil
Thou mayest not in the day thou eatest thou diest
Death is the penalty imposed beware
And govern well thy appetite lest Sin
Surprise thee and her black attendant Death
Here finished he and all that he had made
