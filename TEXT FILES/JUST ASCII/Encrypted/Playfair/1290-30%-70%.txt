Ecuador Economy

Overview
    Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas Growth
    has been uneven because of natural disasters for example a major
    earthquake in  fluctuations in global oil prices and government
    policies designed to curb inflation The government has not taken a
    supportive attitude toward either domestic or foreign investment although
    its agreement to enter the Andean free trade zone is an encouraging move As
     ended Ecuador received a standby IMF loan of  million which will
    permit the country to proceed with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt
