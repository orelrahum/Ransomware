  They were learning to draw the Dormouse went on yawning and
rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew
all manner of thingseverything that begins with an M

  Why with an M? said Alice

  Why not? said the March Hare

  Alice was silent

  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going
off into a doze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up
again with a little shriek and went on  that begins with an
M such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchness
you know you say things are "much of a muchness"did you ever
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?

  Really now you ask me said Alice very much confused I
dont think

  Then you shouldnt talk said the Hatter

  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear  she got
up in great disgust and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep
instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her
going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that
they would call after her  the last time she saw them they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot

  At any rate Ill never go THERE again said Alice as she
picked her way through the wood  Its the stupidest teaparty I
ever was at in all my life

  Just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a
door leading right into it  Thats very curious she thought
But everythings curious today  I think I may as well go in at
once  And in she went

  Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the
little glass table  Now Ill manage better this time she
said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and
unlocking the door that led into the garden  Then she went to
work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her
pocked till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the
little passage  and THENshe found herself at last in the
beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool
fountains

                   The Queens CroquetGround


  A large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden  the
roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at
it busily painting them red  Alice thought this a very curious
thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up
to them she heard one of them say Look out now Five  Dont go
splashing paint over me like that

  I couldnt help it said Five in a sulky tone Seven jogged
my elbow

  On which Seven looked up and said Thats right Five  Always
lay the blame on others

  YOUD better not talk said Five  I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded

  What for? said the one who had spoken first

  Thats none of YOUR business Two said Seven

  Yes it IS his business said Five and Ill tell himit
was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions

  Seven flung down his brush and had just begun Well of all
the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as
she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly  the
others looked round also and all oZ FRSC TWYKR XUY
