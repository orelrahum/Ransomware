	will rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a
	poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster

DUKE SENIOR	By my faith he is very swift and sententious

TOUCHSTONE	According to the fools bolt sir and such dulcet diseases

JAQUES	But for the seventh cause how did you find the
	quarrel on the seventh cause?

TOUCHSTONE	Upon a lie seven times removedbear your body more
	seeming Audreyas thus sir I did dislike the
	cut of a certain courtiers beard he sent me word
	if I said his beard was not cut well he was in the
	mind it was this is called the Retort Courteous
	If I sent him word again it was not well cut he
	would send me word he cut it to please himself
	this is called the Quip Modest If again it was
	not well cut he disabled my judgment this is
	called the Reply Churlish If again it was not
	well cut he would answer I spake not true this
	is called the Reproof Valiant If again it was not
	well cut he would say I lied this is called the
	Countercheque Quarrelsome and so to the Lie
	Circumstantial and the Lie Direct

JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial
	nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct and so we
	measured swords and parted

JAQUES	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?

TOUCHSTONE	O sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have
	books for good manners I will name you the degrees
	The first the Retort Courteous the second the
	Quip Modest the third the Reply Churlish the
	fourth the Reproof Valiant the fifth the
	Countercheque Quarrelsome the sixth the Lie with
	Circumstance the seventh the Lie Direct All
	these you may avoid but the Lie Direct and you may
	avoid that too with an If I knew when seven
	justices could not take up a quarrel but when the
	parties were met themselves one of them thought but
	of an If as If you said so then I said so and
	they shook hands and swore brothers Your If is the
	only peacemaker much virtue in If

JAQUES	Is not this a rare fellow my lord? hes as good at
	any thing and yet a fool

DUKE SENIOR	He uses his folly like a stalkinghorse and under
	the presentation of that he shoots his wit

	Enter HYMEN ROSALIND and CELIA

	Still Music

HYMEN	        Then is there mirth in heaven
	When earthly things made even
	Atone together
	Good duke receive thy daughter
	Hymen from heaven brought her
	Yea brought her hither
	That thou mightst join her hand with his
	Whose heart within his bosom is

ROSALIND	To DUKE SENIOR  To you I give myself for I am yours

	To ORLANDO

	To you I give myself for I am yours

DUKE SENIOR	If there be truth in sight you are my daughter

ORLANDO	If there be truth in sight you are my Rosalind

PHEBE	If sight and shape be true
	Why then my love adieu

ROSALIND	Ill have no father if you be not he
	Ill have no husband if you be not he
	Nor neer wed woman if you be not she

HYMEN	        Peace ho I bar confusion
	Tis I must make conclusion
	Of these most strange events
	Heres eight that must take hands
	To join in Hymens bands
	If truth holds true contents
	You and you no cross shall part
	You and you are heart in heart
	You to his love must accord
	Or have a woman to your lord
	You and you are sure together
	As the winter to foul weather
	Whiles a wedlockhymn we sing
	Feed yourselves with questioning
	That reason wonder may diminish
	How thus we met and these things finish

	SONG
	Wedding is great Junos crown
	O blessed bond of board and bed
	Tis Hymen peoples every town
	High wedlock then be honoured
	Honour high honour and renown
	To Hymen god of every town

DUKE SENIOR	O my dear niece welcome thou art to me
	Even daughter welcome in no less degree

PHEBE	I will not eat my word now thou art mine
	Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine

	Enter JAQUES DE BOYS

JAQUES DE BOYS	Let me have audience for a word or two
	I am the second son of old Sir Rowland
	That bring these tidings to this fair assembly
	Duke Frederick hearing how that every day
	Men of great worth resorted to this forest
	Addressd a mighty power which were on foot
	In his own conduct purposely to take
	His brother here and put him to the sword
	And to the skirts of this wild wood he came
	Where meeting with an old religious man
	After some question with him was converted
	Both from his enterprise and from the world
	His crown bequeathing to his banishd brother
	And all their lands restored to them again
	That were with him exiled This to be true
	I do engage my life
