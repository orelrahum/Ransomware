Rather how hast thou yielded to transgress
The strict forbiddance how to violate
The sacred fruit forbidden  Some cursed fraud
Of enemy hath beguiled thee yet unknown
And me with thee hath ruined for with thee
Certain my resolution is to die
How can I live without thee how forego
Thy sweet converse and love so dearly joined
To live again in these wild woods forlorn
Should God create another Eve and I
Another rib afford yet loss of thee
Would never from my heart no noI feel
The link of Nature draw me flesh of flesh
Bone of my bone thou art and from thy state
Mine never shall be parted bliss or woe
So having said as one from sad dismay
Recomforted and after thoughts disturbed
Submitting to what seemed remediless
Thus in calm mood his words to Eve he turned
Bold deed thou hast presumed adventurous Eve
And peril great provoked who thus hast dared
Had it been only coveting to eye
That sacred fruit sacred to abstinence
Much more to taste it under ban to touch
But past who can recall or done undo?
Not God Omnipotent nor Fate yet so
Perhaps thou shalt not die perhaps the fact
Is not so heinous now foretasted fruit
Profaned first by the serpent by him first
Made common and unhallowed ere our taste
Nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives
Lives as thou saidst and gains to live as Man
Higher degree of life inducement strong
To us as likely tasting to attain
Proportional ascent which cannot be
But to be Gods or Angels demiGods
Nor can I think that God Creator wise
Though threatening will in earnest so destroy
Us his prime creatures dignified so high
Set over all his works which in our fall
For us created needs with us must fail
Dependant made so God shall uncreate
Be frustrate do undo and labour lose
Not well conceived of God who though his power
Creation could repeat yet would be loth
Us to abolish lest the Adversary
Triumph and say "Fickle their state whom God
"Most favours who can please him long? Me first
"He ruined now Mankind whom will he next?"
Matter of scorn not to be given the Foe
However I with thee have fixed my lot
Certain to undergo like doom  If death
Consort with thee death is to me as life
So forcible within my heart I feel
