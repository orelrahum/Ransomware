Paradise Lost by John Milton

The oldest etext known to Project Gutenberg ca 
If you know of any older ones please let us know


Introduction  one page

This etext was originally created in  according to Dr
Joseph Raben of Queens College NY to whom it is attributed by
Project Gutenberg  We had heard of this etext for years but it
was not until  that we actually managed to track it down to
a specific location and then it took months to convince people
to let us have a copy then more months for them actually to do
the copying and get it to us  Then another month to convert to
something we could massage with our favorite  in DOS  After
that is was only a matter of days to get it into this shape you
will see below  The original was of course in CAPS only and
so were all the other etexts of the s and early s  Dont
let anyone fool you into thinking any etext with both upper and
lower case is an original all those original Project Gutenberg
etexts were also in upper case and were translated or rewritten
many times to get them into their current condition  They have
been worked on by many people throughout the world

In the course of our searches for Professor Raben and his etext
we were never able to determine where copies were or which of a
variety of editions he may have used as a source  We did get a
little information here and there but even after we received a
copy of the etext we were unwilling to release it without first
determining that it was in fact Public Domain and finding Raben
to verify this and get his permission  Interested enough in a
totally unrelated action to our searches for him the professor
subscribed to the Project Gutenberg listserver and we happened
by accident to notice his name We dont really look at every
subscription request as the computers usually handle them The
etext was then properly identified copyright analyzed and the
current edition prepared

To give you an estimation of the difference in the original and
what we have today  the original was probably entered on cards
commonly known at the time as "IBM cards" Do Not Fold Spindle
or Mutilate and probably took in excess of  of them  A
single card could hold  characters hence  characters is an
accepted standard for so many computer margins and the entire
original edition we received in all caps was over  chars
in length including line enumeration symbols for caps and the
punctuation marks etc since they were not available keyboard
characters at the time probably the keyboards operated at baud
rates of around  meaning the typists had to type slowly for
the keyboard to keep up

This is the second version of Paradise Lost released by Project
Gutenberg  The first was released as our October  etext





Paradise Lost




Book I


Of Mans first disobedience and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
Brought death into the World and all our woe
With loss of Eden till one greater Man
Restore us and regain the blissful seat
Sing Heavenly Muse that on the secret top
Of Oreb or of Sinai didst inspire
That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
In the beginning how the heavens and earth
Rose out of Chaos or if Sion hill
Delight thee more and Siloas brook that flowed
Fast by the oracle of God I thence
Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song
That with no middle flight intends to soar
Above th Aonian mount while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme
And chiefly thou O Spirit that dost prefer
Before all temples th upright heart and pure
Instruct me for thou knowst thou from the first
Wast present and with mighty wings outspread
Dovelike satst brooding on the vast Abyss
And madst it pregnant what in me is dark
Illumine what is low raise and support
That to the height of this great argument
I may assert Eternal Providence
And justify the ways of God to men
  Say firstfor Heaven hides nothing from thy view
Nor the deep tract of Hellsay first what cause
Moved our grand parents in that happy state
Favoured of Heaven so highly to fall off
From their Creator and transgress his will
For one restraint lords of the World besides
Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?
  Th infernal Serpent he it was whose guile
Stirred up with envy and revenge deceived
The mother of mankind what time his pride
Had cast him out from Heaven with all his host
Of rebel Angels by whose aid aspiring
To set himself in glory above his peers
He trusted to have equalled the Most High
If he opposed and with ambitious aim
Against the throne and monarchy of God
Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud
With vain attempt Him the Almighty Power
Hurled headlong flaming from th ethereal sky
With hideous ruin and combustion down
To bottomless perdition there to dwell
In adamantine chains and penal fire
Who durst defy th Omnipotent to arms
  Nine times the space that measures day and night
To mortal men he with his horrid crew
Lay vanquished rolling in the fiery gulf
Confounded though immortal But his doom
Reserved him to more wrath for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate
At once as far as Angels ken he views
The dismal situation waste and wild
A dungeon horrible on all sides round
As one great furnace flamed yet from those flames
No light but rather darkness visible
Served only to discover sights of woe
Regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace
And rest can never dwell hope never comes
That comes to all but torture without end
Still urges and a fiery deluge fed
With everburning sulphur unconsumed
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared
For those rebellious here their prison ordained
In utter darkness and their portion set
As far removed from God and light of Heaven
As from the centre thrice to th utmost pole
Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell
There the companions of his fall oerwhelmed
With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire
He soon discerns and weltering by his side
One next himself in power and next in crime
Long after known in Palestine and named
Beelzebub To whom th ArchEnemy
And thence in Heaven called Satan with bold words
Breaking the horrid silence thus began
  "If thou beest hebut O how fallen how changed
From him who in the happy realms of light
Clothed with transcendent brightness didst outshine
Myriads though brightif he whom mutual league
United thoughts and counsels equal hope
And hazard in the glorious enterprise
Joined with me once now misery hath joined
In equal ruin into what pit thou seest
From what height fallen so much the stronger proved
He with his thunder and till then who knew
The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those
Nor what the potent Victor in his rage
Can else inflict do I repent or change
Though changed in outward lustre that fixed mind
And high disdain from sense of injured merit
That with the Mightiest raised me to contend
And to the fierce contentions brought along
Innumerable force of Spirits armed
That durst dislike his reign and me preferring
His utmost power with adverse power opposed
In dubious battle on the plains of Heaven
And shook his throne What though the field be lost?
All is not lostthe unconquerable will
And study of revenge immortal hate
And courage never to submit or yield
And what is else not to be overcome?
That glory never shall his wrath or might
Extort from me To bow and sue for grace
With suppliant knee and deify his power
Who from the terror of this arm so late
Doubted his empirethat were low indeed
That were an ignominy and shame beneath
This downfall since by fate the strength of Gods
And this empyreal sybstance cannot fail
Since through experience of this great event
In arms not worse in foresight much advanced
We may with more successful hope resolve
To wage by force or guile eternal war
Irreconcilable to our grand Foe
Who now triumphs and in th excess of joy
Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven"
  So spake th apostate Angel though in pain
Vaunting aloud but racked with deep despair
And him thus answered soon his bold compeer
  "O Prince O Chief of many throned Powers
That led th embattled Seraphim to war
Under thy conduct and in dreadful deeds
Fearless endangered Heavens perpetual King
And put to proof his high supremacy
Whether upheld by strength or chance or fate
Too well I see and rue the dire event
That with sad overthrow and foul defeat
Hath lost us Heaven and all this mighty host
In horrible destruction laid thus low
As far as Gods and heavenly Essences
Can perish for the mind and spirit remains
Invincible and vigour soon returns
Though all our glory extinct and happy state
Here swallowed up in endless misery
But what if he our Conqueror whom I now
Of force believe almighty since no less
Than such could have oerpowered such force as ours
Have left us this our spirit and BPESDFPM ARGMES
