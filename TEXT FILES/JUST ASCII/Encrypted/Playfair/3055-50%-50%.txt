The prison of his ryranny who reigns
By our delay? No let us rather choose
Armed with Hellflames and fury all at once
Oer Heavens high towers to force resistless way
Turning our tortures into horrid arms
Against the Torturer when to meet the noise
Of his almighty engine he shall hear
Infernal thunder and for lightning see
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
Among his Angels and his throne itself
Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire
His own invented torments But perhaps
The way seems difficult and steep to scale
With upright wing against a higher foe
Let such bethink them if the sleepy drench
Of that forgetful lake benumb not still
That in our porper motion we ascend
Up to our native seat descent and fall
To us is adverse Who but felt of late
When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
Insulting and pursued us through the Deep
