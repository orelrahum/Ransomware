To mingle and involve done all to spite
The great Creator? But their spite still serves
His glory to augment The bold design
Pleased highly those infernal States and joy
Sparkled in all their eyes with full assent
They vote whereat his speech he thus renews
"Well have ye judged well ended long debate
Synod of Gods and like to what ye are
Great things resolved which from the lowest deep
Will once more lift us up in spite of fate
Nearer our ancient seatperhaps in view
Of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms
And opportune excursion we may chance
Reenter Heaven or else in some mild zone
Dwell not unvisited of Heavens fair light
Secure and at the brightening orient beam
Purge off this gloom the soft delicious air
To heal the scar of these corrosive fires
Shall breathe her balm But first whom shall we send
In search of this new World? whom shall we find
Sufficient? who shall tempt with wandering feet
The dark unbottomed infinite Abyss
And through the palpable obscure find out
His uncouth way or spread his airy flight
Upborne with indefatigable wings
Over the vast abrupt ere he arrive
The happy Isle? What strength what art can then
Suffice or what evasion bear him safe
Through the strict senteries and stations thick
Of Angels watching round? Here he had need
All circumspection and we now no less
Choice in our suffrage for on whom we send
The weight of all and our last hope relies"
  This said he sat and expectation held
His look suspense awaiting who appeared
To second or oppose or undertake
The perilous attempt But all sat mute
Pondering the danger with deep thoughts and each
In others countenance read his own dismay
Astonished None among the choice and prime
Of those Heavenwarring champions could be found
So hardy as to proffer or accept
Alone the dreadful voyage till at last
Satan whom now transcendent glory raised
Above his fellows with monarchal pride
Conscious of highest worth unmoved thus spake
  "O Progeny of Heaven Empyreal Thrones
With reason hath deep silence and demur
Seized us though undismayed Long is the way
And hard that out of Hell leads up to light
Our prison strong this huge convex of fire
Outrageous to devour immures us round
Ninefold and gates of burning adamant
Barred over us prohibit all egress
These passed if any pass the void profound
Of unessential Night receives him next
Widegaping and with utter loss of being
Threatens him plunged in that abortive gulf
If thence he scape into whatever world
Or unknown region what remains him less
Than unknown dangers and as hard escape?
But I should ill become this throne O Peers
And this imperial sovereignty adorned
With splendour armed with power if aught proposed
And judged of public moment in the shape
Of difficulty or danger could deter
Me from attempting Wherefore do I assume
These royalties and not refuse to reign
Refusing to accept as great a share
Of hazard as of honour due alike
To him who reigns and so much to him due
Of hazard more as he above the rest
High honoured sits? Go therefore mighty Powers
Terror of Heaven though fallen intend at home
While here shall be our home what best may ease
The present misery and render Hell
More tolerable if there be cure or charm
To respite or deceive or slack the pain
Of this ill mansion intermit no watch
Against a wakeful foe while I abroad
Through all the coasts of dark destruction seek
Deliverance for us all This enterprise
None shall partake with me" Thus saying rose
The Monarch and prevented all reply
Prudent lest from his resolution raised
Others among the chief might offer now
Certain to be refused what erst they feared
And so refused might in opinion stand
His rivals winning cheap the high repute
Which he through hazard huge must earn But they
Dreaded not more th adventure than his voice
Forbidding and at once with him they rose
Their rising all at once was as the sound
Of thunder heard remote Towards him they bend
With awful reverence prone and as a God
Extol him equal to the Highest in Heaven
Nor failed they to express how much they praised
That for the general safety he despised
His own for neither do the Spirits damned
Lose all their virtue lest bad men should boast
Their specious deeds on earth which glory excites
Or close ambition varnished oer with zeal
  Thus they their doubtful consultations dark
Ended rejoicing in their matchless Chief
As when from mountaintops the dusky clouds
Ascending while the north wind sleeps oerspread
Heavens cheerful face the louring element
Scowls oer the darkened landscape snow or shower
If chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet
Extend his evening beam the fields revive
The birds their notes renew and bleating herds
Attest their joy that hill and valley rings
O shame to men Devil with devil damned
Firm concord holds men only disagree
Of creatures rational though under hope
Of heavenly grace and God proclaiming peace
Yet live in hatred enmity and strife
Among themselves and levy cruel wars
Wasting the earth each other to destroy
As if which might induce us to accord
Man had not hellish foes enow besides
That day and night for his destruction wait
  The Stygian council thus dissolved and forth
In order came the grand infernal Peers
Midst came their mighty Paramount and seemed
Alone th antagonist of Heaven nor less
Than Hells dread Emperor with pomp supreme
And godlike imitated state him round
A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed
With bright emblazonry and horrent arms
Then of their session ended they bid cry
With trumpets regal sound the great result
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy
By heralds voice explained the hollow Abyss
Heard far adn wide and all the host of Hell
With deafening shout returned them loud acclaim
Thence more at ease their minds and somewhat raised
By false presumptuous hope the ranged Powers
Disband and wandering each his several way
Pursues as inclination or sad choice
Leads him perplexed where he may likeliest find
Truce to his restless thoughts and entertain
The irksome hours till his great Chief return
Part on the plain or in the air sublime
Upon the wing or in swift race contend
As at th Olympian games or Pythian fields
Part curb their fiery steeds or shun the goal
With rapid wheels or fronted brigades form
As when to warn proud cities war appears
Waged in the troubled sky and armies rush
To battle in the clouds before each van
Prick forth the airy knights and couch their spears
Till thickest legions close with feats of arms
From either end of heaven the welkin burns
Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell
Rend up both rocks and hills and ride the air
In whirlwind Hell scarce holds the wild uproar
As when Alcides from Oechalia crowned
With conquest felt th envenomed robe and tore
Through pain up by the roots Thessalian pines
And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw
Into th Euboic sea Others more mild
Retreated in a silent valley sing
With notes angelical to many a harp
Their own heroic deeds and hapless fall
By doom of battle and complain that Fate
Free Virtue should enthrall to Force or Chance
Their song was partial but the harmony
What could it less when Spirits immortal sing?
Suspended Hell and took with ravishment
The thronging audience In discourse more sweet
For Eloquence the Soul Song charms the Sense
Others apart sat on a hill retired
In thoughts more elevate and reasoned high
Of Providence Foreknowledge Will and Fate
Fixed fate free will foreknowledge absolute
And found no end in wandering mazes lost
Of good and evil much they argued then
Of happiness and final misery
Passion and apathy and glory and shame
Vain wisdom all and false philosophy
Yet with a pleasing sorcery could charm
Pain for a while or anguish and excite
Fallacious hope or arm th obdured breast
With stubborn patience as with triple steel
Another part in squadrons and gross bands
On bold adventure to discover wide
That dismal world if any clime perhaps
Might yield them easier habitation bend
Four ways their flying march along the banks
Of four infernal rivers that disgorge
Into the burning lake their baleful streams
Abhorred Styx the flood of deadly hate
Sad Acheron of sorrow black and deep
Cocytus named of lamentation loud
Heard on the rueful stream fierce Phlegeton
Whose waves of torrent fire inflame with rage
Far off from these a slow and silent stream
Lethe the river of oblivion rolls
Her watery labyrinth whereof who drinks
Forthwith his former state and being forgets
Forgets both joy and grief pleasure and pain
Beyond this flood a frozen continent
Lies dark and wild beat with perpetual storms
Of whirlwind and dire hail which on firm land
Thaws not but gathers heap and ruin seems
Of ancient pile all else deep snow and ice
A gulf profound as that Serbonian bog
Betwixt Damiata and Mount Casius old
Where armies whole have sunk the parching air
Burns frore and cold performs th effect of fire
Thither by harpyfooted Furies haled
At certain revolutions all the damned
Are brought and feel by turns the bitter change
Of fierce extremes extremes by change more fierce
From beds of raging fire to starve in ice
Their soft ethereal warmth and there to pine
Immovable infixed and frozen round
Periods of timethence hurried back to fire
They ferry over this Lethean sound
Both to and fro their sorrow to augment
And wish and struggle as they pass to reach
The tempting stream with one small drop to lose
In sweet forgetfulness all pain and woe
All in one moment and so near the brink
But Fate withstands and to oppose th attempt
Medusa with Gorgonian terror guards
The ford and of itself the water flies
All taste of living wight as once it fled
The lip of Tantalus Thus roving on
In confused march forlorn th adventurous bands
With shuddering horror pale and eyes aghast
Viewed first their lamentable lot and found
No rest Through many a dark and dreary vale
They passed and many a region dolorous
Oer many a frozen many a fiery alp
Rocks caves lakes fens bogs dens and shades of death
A universe of death which God by curse
Created evil for evil only good
Where all life dies death lives and Nature breeds
Perverse all monstrous all prodigious things
Obominable inutterable and worse
Than fables yet have feigned or fear conceived
Gorgons and Hydras and Chimeras dire
  Meanwhile the Adversary of God and Man
Satan with thoughts inflamed of highest design
Puts on swift wings and toward the gates of Hell
Explores his solitary flight sometimes
He scours the right hand coast sometimes the left
Now shaves with level wing the deep then soars
Up to the fiery concave towering high
As when far off at sea a fleet descried
Hangs in the clouds by equinoctial winds
Close sailing from Bengala or the isles
Of Ternate and Tidore whence merchants bring
Their spicy drugs they on the trading flood
Through the wide Ethiopian to the Cape
Ply stemming nightly toward the pole so seemed
Far off the flying Fiend At last appear
Hellbounds high reaching to the horrid roof
And thrice threefold the gates three folds were brass
Three iron three of adamantine rock
Impenetrable impaled with circling fire
Yet unconsumed Before the gates there sat
On either side a formidable Shape
The one seemed woman to the waist and fair
But ended foul in many a scaly fold
Voluminous and vasta serpent armed
With mortal sting About her middle round
A cry of Hellhounds neverceasing barked
With wide Cerberean mouths full loud and rung
A hideous peal yet when they list would creep
If aught disturbed their noise into her womb
And kennel there yet there still barked and howled
Within unseen Far less abhorred than these
Vexed Scylla bathing in the sea that parts
Calabria from the hoarse Trinacrian shore
Nor uglier follow the nighthag when called
In secret riding through the air she comes
Lured with the smell of infant blood to dance
With Lapland witches while the labouring moon
Eclipses at their charms The other Shape
If shape it might be called that shape had none
Distinguishable in member joint or limb
Or substance might be called that shadow seemed
For each seemed eitherblack it stood as Night
Fierce as ten Furies terrible as Hell
And shook a dreadful dart what seemed his head
The likeness of a kingly crown had on
Satan was now at hand and from his seat
The monster moving onward came as fast
With horrid strides Hell trembled as he strode
Th undaunted Fiend what this might be admired
Admired not feared God and his Son except
Created thing naught valued he nor shunned
And with disdainful look thus first began
  "Whence and what art thou execrable Shape
That darst though grim and terrible advance
Thy miscreated front athwart my way
To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass
That be assured without leave asked of thee
Retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof
Hellborn not to contend with Spirits of Heaven"
  To whom the Goblin full of wrath replied
"Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he
Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith till then
Unbroken and in proud rebellious arms
Drew after him the third part of Heavens sons
Conjured against the Highestfor which both thou
And they outcast from God are here condemned
To waste eternal days in woe and pain?
And reckonst thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven
Helldoomed and breathst defiance here and scorn
Where I reign king and to enrage thee more
Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment
False fugitive and to thy speed add wings
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue
Thy lingering or with one stroke of this dart
Strange horror seize thee and pangs unfelt before"
  So spake the grisly Terror and in shape
So speaking and so threatening grew tenfold
More dreadful and deform On th other side
Incensed with indignation Satan stood
Unterrified and like a comet burned
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
In th arctic sky and from his horrid hair
Shakes pestilence and war Each at the head
Levelled his deadly aim their fatal hands
No second stroke intend and such a frown
Each cast at th other as when two black clouds
