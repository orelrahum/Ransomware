Note
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June  ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Sinai and the Golan
    Heights As stated in the  Camp David accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bushs post  Gulf crisis peace initiative the final status of
    the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors
    and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined In the US view the term West Bank describes all
    of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before
    the  ArabIsraeli war With respect to negotiations envisaged in the
    framework agreement however it is US policy that a distinction must be
    made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys
    special status and circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for the
    final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the
    rest of the West Bank
    The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military authorities and
    Israeli civil administration it is US policy that the final status of the
    Gaza Strip will be determined by negotiations among the concerned parties
    these negotiations will determine how this area is to be governed

Gaza Strip Economy

Overview

    remittances accounting for about onethird of GNP The construction
    agricultural and industrial sectors account for about   and  of
    GNP respectively Gaza depends upon Israel for some  of its external
    trade Unrest in the territory in  intifadah has raised
    unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of Gazans The
    Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza
    since August  Worker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged
    unemployment has increased and exports have fallen dramatically The areas

Georgia Economy

Overview
    Among the former Soviet republics Georgia is noted for its Black Sea
    tourist industry its large output of citrus fruits and tea and the amazing
    diversity of an industrial sector that accounted however for less than 
    of the USSRs output Another salient characteristic of the economy has been
    a flourishing private sector compared with the other republics Almost 
    of the labor force is employed in agriculture and  in industry Mineral
    resources consist of manganese and copper and to a lesser extent
    molybdenum arsenic tungsten and mercury Except for very small quantities
    of domestic oil gas and coal fuel must be imported from neighboring
    republics Oil and its products are delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to
    the port of Batumi for export and local refining Gas is supplied in
    pipelines from Krasnodar and Stavropol Georgia is nearly selfsufficient
    in electric power thanks to abundant hydropower stations as well as some
    thermal power stations The dismantling of central economic controls is
    being delayed by political factionalism marked by armed struggles between
    the elected government and the opposition and industrial output seems to
    have fallen more steeply in Georgia in  than in any other of the former
    Soviet republics To prevent further economic decline Georgia must
    establish domestic peace and must maintain economic ties to the other former
    Soviet republics while developing new links to the West

Germany Economy

Overview
    The Federal Republic of Germany is making substantial progress in
    integrating and modernizing eastern Germany but at a heavy economic cost
    Western Germanys growth in  slowed to   the lowest rate since 
     because of slack world growth and higher interest rates and taxes required
    by the unification process While western Germanys economy was in recession
    in the last half of  eastern Germanys economy bottomed out after a
    nearly twoyear freefall and shows signs of recovery particularly in the
    construction transportation and service sectors Eastern Germany could
    begin a fragile recovery later concentrated in  in construction
    transportation and services The two regions remain vastly different
    however despite eastern Germanys progress Western Germany has an advanced
    market economy and is a world leader in exports It has a highly urbanized
    and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards abundant
    leisure time and comprehensive social welfare benefits Western Germany is
    relatively poor in natural resources coal being the most important mineral
    Western Germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically advanced
    goods The regions economy is mature services and manufacturing account
    for the dominant share of economic activity and raw materials and
    semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports In recent
    years manufacturing has accounted for about  of GDP with other sectors
    contributing lesser amounts Gross fixed investment in  accounted for
    about  of GDP In  GDP in the western region was an estimated
     per capita In contrast eastern Germanys economy is shedding the
    obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the Communist
    era Eastern Germanys share of allGerman GDP is only about  and eastern
    productivity is just  that of the west The privatization agency for
    eastern Germany the Treuhand is rapidly selling many of the  firms
    under its control The pace of private investment is starting to pick up
    but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain
    Eastern Germany has one of the worlds largest reserves of lowgrade lignite
    coal but little else in the way of mineral resources The quality of
    statistics from eastern Germany is improving yet many gaps remain the
    federal government began producing allGerman data for select economic
    statistics at the start of  The most challenging economic problem is
    promoting eastern Germanys economic reconstruction  specifically finding
    the right mix of fiscal monetary regulatory and tax policies that will
    spur investment in eastern Germany  without destabilizing western Germanys
    economy or damaging relations with West European partners The biggest
    danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could
    fuel inflation and prompt the German Central Bank the Bundesbank to keep a
    tight monetary policy to choke off a wageprice spiral Meanwhile the FRG
    has been providing billions of dollars to help the former Soviet republics
    and the reformist economies of Eastern Europe
