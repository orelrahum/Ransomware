disadvantage of working with overseas keyers is that they are much less
likely to telephone with questions especially on the coding with the
result that they develop their own rules as they encounter new
situations

Government contracting procedures and time frames posed a major challenge
to performing the conversion  Many service bureaus are not accustomed to
retaining the image even if they perform OCR  Thus questions of image
format and storage media were somewhat novel to many of them  ERWAY also
remarked other problems in dealing with service bureaus for example
their inability to perform text conversion from the kind of microfilm
that LC uses for preservation purposes

But quality control in ERWAYs experience was the most timeconsuming
aspect of contracting out conversion  AM has been attempting to perform
a percent quality review looking at either every tenth document or
every tenth page to make certain that the service bureaus are maintaining
 percent accuracy  But even if they are complying with the
requirement for accuracy finding errors produces a desire to correct
them and in turn to clean up the whole collection which defeats the
purpose to some extent  Even a double entry requires a
characterbycharacter comparison to the original to meet the accuracy
requirement  LC is not accustomed to publish imperfect texts which
makes attempting to deal with the industry standard an emotionally
fraught issue for AM  As was mentioned in the previous days discussion
going from  to  percent accuracy usually doubles costs and
means a third keying or another complete runthrough of the text

Although AM has learned much from its experiences with various collections
and various service bureaus ERWAY concluded pessimistically that no
breakthrough has been achieved   Incremental improvements have occurred
in some of the OCR technology some of the processes and some of the
standards acceptances which though they may lead to somewhat lower costs
do not offer much encouragement to many people who are anxiously awaiting
the day that the entire contents of LC are available online

                                 


ZIDAR  Several answers to why one attempts to perform fulltext
conversion  Per page cost of performing OCR  Typical problems
encountered during editing  Editing poor copy OCR vs rekeying 


Judith ZIDAR coordinator National Agricultural Text Digitizing Program
NATDP National Agricultural Library NAL offered several answers to
the question of why one attempts to perform fulltext conversion  
Text in an image can be read by a human but not by a computer so of
course it is not searchable and there is not much one can do with it  
Some material simply requires wordlevel access  For instance the legal
profession insists on fulltext access to its material with taxonomic or
geographic material which entails numerous names one virtually requires
wordlevel access   Full text permits rapid browsing and searching
something that cannot be achieved in an image with todays technology
 Text stored as ASCII and delivered in ASCII is standardized and highly
portable   People just want fulltext searching even those who do not
know how to do it  NAL for the most part is performing OCR at an
actual cost per averagesize page of approximately   NAL scans the
page to create the electronic image and passes it through the OCR device

ZIDAR next rehearsed several typical problems encountered during editing
Praising the celerity of her student workers ZIDAR observed that editing
requires approximately five to ten minutes per page assuming that there
are no large tables to audit  Confusion among the three characters I 
and l constitutes perhaps the most common problem encountered  Zeroes
and  Os also are  frequently confused  Double Ms create a particular
problem even on clean pages  They are so wide in most fonts that they
touch and the system simply cannot tell where one letter ends and the
other begins  Complex page formats occasionally fail to columnate
properly which entails rescanning as though one were working with a
single column entering the ASCII and decolumnating for better
searching  With proportionally spaced text OCR can have difficulty
discerning what is a space and what are merely spaces between letters as
opposed to spaces between words and therefore will merge text or break
up words where it should not

ZIDAR said that it can often take longer to edit a poorcopy OCR than to
key it from scratch  NAL has also experimented with partial editing of
text whereby project workers go into and clean up the format removing
stray characters but not running a spellcheck  NAL corrects typos in
the title and authors names which provides a foothold for searching and
browsing  Even extremely poorquality OCR eg percent accuracy
can still be searched because numerous words are correct while the
important words are probably repeated often enough that they are likely
to be found correct somewhere  Librarians however cannot tolerate this
situation though end users seem more willing to use this text for
searching provided that NAL indicates that it is unedited  ZIDAR
concluded that rekeying of text may be the best route to take in spite
of numerous problems with quality control and cost

                                 


DISCUSSION  Modifying an image before performing OCR  NALs costs per
page AMs costs per page and experience with Federal Prison Industries 
Elements comprising NATDPs costs per page  OCR and structured markup 
Distinction between the structure of a document and its representation
when put on the screen or printed 


HOOTON prefaced the lengthy discussion that followed with several
comments about modifying an image before one reaches the point of
performing OCR  For example in regard to an application containing a
significant amount of redundant data such as formtype data numerous
companies today are working on various kinds of form renewal prior to
going through a recognition process by using dropout colors  Thus
acquiring access to form design or using electronic means are worth
considering  HOOTON also noted that conversion usually makes or breaks
ones imaging system  It is extremely important extremely costly in
terms of either capital investment or service and determines the quality
of the remainder of ones system because it determines the character of
the raw material used by the system

Concerning the four projects undertaken by NAL two inside and two
performed by outside contractors ZIDAR revealed that an inhouse service
bureau executed the first at a cost between  and  per page for
everything including building of the database  The project undertaken
by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research CGIAR
cost approximately  per page for the conversion plus some expenses
for the software and building of the database  The Acid Rain Projecta
twodisk set produced by the University of Vermont consisting of
Canadian publications on acid raincost  per page for everything
including keying of the text which was double keyed scanning of the
images and building of the database  The inhouse project offered
considerable ease of convenience and greater control of the process  On
the other hand the service bureaus know their job and perform it
expeditiously because they have more people

As a useful comparison ERWAY revealed AMs costs as follows  
cents to  cents per thousand characters with an average page
containing  characters  Requirements for coding and imaging
increase the costs  Thus conversion of the text including the coding
costs approximately  per page  This figure does not include the
imaging and databasebuilding included in the NAL costs  AM also
enjoyed a happy experience with Federal Prison Industries which
precluded the necessity of going through the requestforproposal process
to award a contract because it is another government agency  The
prisoners performed AMs rekeying just as well as other service bureaus
and proved handy as well  AM shipped them the books which they would
photocopy on a bookedge scanner  They would perform the markup on
photocopies return the books as soon as they were done with them
perform the keying and return the material to AM on WORM disks

ZIDAR detailed the elements that constitute the previously noted cost of
approximately  per page  Most significant is the editing correction
of errors and spellcheckings which though they may sound easy to
perform require in fact a great deal of time  Reformatting text also
takes a while but a significant amount of NALs expenses are for equipment
which was extremely expensive when purchased because it was one of the few
systems on the market  The costs of equipment are being amortized over
five years but are still quite high nearly  per month

HOCKEY raised a general question concerning OCR and the amount of editing
required substantial in her experience to generate the kind of
structured markup necessary for manipulating the text on the computer or
loading it into any retrieval system  She wondered if the speakers could
extend the previous question about the costbenefit of adding or exerting
structured markup  ERWAY noted that several OCR systems retain italics
bolding and other spatial formatting  While the material may not be in
the format desired these systems possess the ability to remove the
original materials quickly from the hands of the people performing the
conversion as well as to retain that information so that users can work
with it  HOCKEY rejoined that the current thinking on markup is that one
should not say that something is italic or bold so much as why it is that
way  To be sure one needs to know that something was italicized but
how can one get from one to the other?  One can map from the structure to
the typographic representation

FLEISCHHAUER suggested that given the  million items the Library
holds it may not be possible for LC to do more than report that a thing
was in italics as opposed to why it was italics although that may be
desirable in some contexts  Promising to talk a bit during the afternoon
session about several experiments OCLC performed on automatic recognition
of document elements and which they hoped to extend WEIBEL said that in
fact one can recognize the major elements of a document with a fairly
high degree of reliability at least as good as OCR  STEVENS drew a
useful distinction between standard generalized markup ie defining
for a documenttype definition the structure of the document and what
he termed a style sheet which had to do with italics bolding and other
forms of emphasis  Thus two different components are at work one being
the structure of the document itself its logic and the other being its
representation when it is put on the screen or printed

                                 

SESSION V  APPROACHES TO PREPARING ELECTRONIC TEXTS


HOCKEY  Text in ASCII and the representation of electronic text versus
an image  The need to look at ways of using markup to assist retrieval 
The need for an encoding format that will be reusable and multifunctional


Susan HOCKEY director Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities
CETH Rutgers and Princeton Universities announced that one talk
WEIBELs was moved into this session from the morning and that David
Packard was unable to attend  The session would attempt to focus more on
what one can do with a text in ASCII and the representation of electronic
text rather than just an image what one can do with a computer that
cannot be done with a book or an image  It would be argued that one can
do much more than just read a text and from that starting point one can
use markup and methods of preparing the text to take full advantage of
the capability of the computer  That would lead to a discussion of what
the European Community calls REUSABILITY what may better be termed
DURABILITY that is how to prepare or make a text that will last a long
time and that can be used for as many applications as possible which
would lead to issues of improving intellectual access

HOCKEY urged the need to look at ways of using markup to facilitate retrieval
not just for referencing or to help locate an item that is retrieved but also to put markup tags in
a text to help retrieve the thing sought either with linguistic tagging or
interpretation  HOCKEY also argued that little advancement had occurred in
the software tools currently available for retrieving and searching text
She pressed the desideratum of going beyond Boolean searches and performing
more sophisticated searching which the insertion of more markup in the text
would facilitate  Thinking about electronic texts as opposed to images means
considering material that will never appear in print form or print will not
be its primary form that is material which only appears in electronic form
HOCKEY alluded to the history and the need for markup and tagging and
electronic text which was developed through the use of computers in the
humanities as MICHELSON had observed Father Busa had started in 
to prepare the firstever text on the computer

HOCKEY remarked several large projects particularly in Europe for the
compilation of dictionaries language studies and language analysis in
which people have built up archives of text and have begun to recognize
the need for an encoding format that will be reusable and multifunctional
that can be used not just to print the text which may be assumed to be a
byproduct of what one wants to do but to structure it inside the computer
so that it can be searched built into a Hypertext system etc

                                 


WEIBEL  OCLCs approach to preparing electronic text  retroconversion
keying of texts more automated ways of developing data  Project ADAPT
and the CORE Project  Intelligent character recognition does not exist 
Advantages of SGML  Data should be free of procedural markup
descriptive markup strongly advocated  OCLCs interface illustrated 
Storage requirements and costs for putting a lot of information on line 


Stuart WEIBEL senior research scientist Online Computer Library Center
Inc OCLC described OCLCs approach to preparing electronic text  He
argued that the electronic world into which we are moving must
accommodate not only the future but the past as well and to some degree
even the present  Thus starting out at one end with retroconversion and
keying of texts one would like to move toward much more automated ways
of developing data

For example Project ADAPT had to do with automatically converting
document images into a structured document database with OCR text as
indexing and also a little bit of automatic formatting and tagging of
that text  The CORE project hosted by Cornell University Bellcore
OCLC the American Chemical Society and Chemical Abstracts constitutes
WEIBELs principal concern at the moment  This project is an example of
converting text for which one already has a machinereadable version into
a format more suitable for electronic delivery and database searching
Since Michael LESK had previously described CORE WEIBEL would say
little concerning it  Borrowing a chemical phrase de novo synthesis
WEIBEL cited the Online Journal of Current Clinical Trials as an example
of de novo electronic publishing that is a form in which the primary
form of the information is electronic

Project ADAPT then which OCLC completed a couple of years ago and in
fact is about to resume is a model in which one takes page images either
in paper or microfilm and converts them automatically to a searchable
electronic database either online or local  The operating assumption
is that accepting some blemishes in the data especially for
retroconversion of materials will make it possible to accomplish more
Not enough money is available to support perfect conversion

WEIBEL related several steps taken to perform image preprocessing
processing on the image before performing optical character
recognition as well as image postprocessing  He denied the existence
of intelligent character recognition and asserted that what is wanted is
page recognition which is a long way off  OCLC has experimented with
merging of multiple optical character recognition systems that will
reduce errors from an unacceptable rate of  characters out of every
l to an unacceptable rate of  characters out of every l but it
is not good enough  It will never be perfect

Concerning the CORE Project WEIBEL observed that Bellcore is taking the
topography files extracting the page images and converting those
topography files to SGML markup  LESK hands that data off to OCLC which
builds that data into a Newton database the same system that underlies
the online system in virtually all of the reference products at OCLC
The longterm goal is to make the systems interoperable so that not just
Bellcores system and OCLCs system can access this data but other
systems can as well and the key to that is the Z common command
language and the fulltext extension  Z is fine for MARC records
but is not enough to do it for full text that is make full texts
interoperable

WEIBEL next outlined the critical role of SGML for a variety of purposes
for example as noted by HOCKEY in the world of extremely large
databases using highly structured data to perform field searches
WEIBEL argued that by building the structure of the data in ie the
structure of the data originally on a printed page it becomes easy to
look at a journal article even if one cannot read the characters and know
where the title or author is or what the sections of that document would be
OCLC wants to make that structure explicit in the database because it will
be important for retrieval purposes

The second big advantage of SGML is that it gives one the ability to
build structure into the database that can be used for display purposes
without contaminating the data with instructions about how to format
things  The distinction lies between procedural markup which tells one
where to put dots on the page and descriptive markup which describes
the elements of a document

WEIBEL believes that there should be no procedural markup in the data at
all that the data should be completely unsullied by information about
italics or boldness  That should be left up to the display device
whether that display device is a page printer or a screen display device
By keeping ones database free of that kind of contamination one can
make decisions down the road for example reorganize the data in ways
that are not cramped by builtin notions of what should be italic and
what should be bold  WEIBEL strongly advocated descriptive markup  As
an example he illustrated the index structure in the CORE data  With
subsequent illustrated examples of markup WEIBEL acknowledged the common
complaint that SGML is hard to read in its native form although markup
decreases considerably once one gets into the body  Without the markup
however one would not have the structure in the data  One can pass
markup through a LaTeX processor and convert it relatively easily to a
printed version of the document

WEIBEL next illustrated an extremely cluttered screen dump of OCLCs
system in order to show as much as possible the inherent capability on
the screen  He noted parenthetically that he had become a supporter of
XWindows as a result of the progress of the CORE Project  WEIBEL also
illustrated the two major parts of the interface  l a control box that
allows one to generate lists of items which resembles a small table of
contents based on key words one wishes to search and  a document
viewer which is a separate process in and of itself  He demonstrated
how to follow links through the electronic database simply by selecting
the appropriate button and bringing them up  He also noted problems that
remain to be accommodated in the interface eg as pointed out by LESK
what happens when users do not click on the icon for the figure

Given the constraints of time WEIBEL omitted a large number of ancillary
items in order to say a few words concerning storage requirements and
what will be required to put a lot of things on line  Since it is
extremely expensive to reconvert all of this data especially if it is
just in paper form and even if it is in electronic form in typesetting
tapes he advocated building journals electronically from the start  In
that case if one only has text graphics and indexing which is all that
one needs with de novo electronic publishing because there is no need to
go back and look at bitmaps of pages one can get  journals of
full text or almost  million pages per year  These pages can be put in
approximately  gigabytes of storage which is not all that much
WEIBEL said  For twenty years something less than three terabytes would
be required  WEIBEL calculated the costs of storing this information as
follows  If a gigabyte costs approximately  then a terabyte costs
approximately  million to buy in terms of hardware  One also needs a
building to put it in and a staff like OCLC to handle that information
So to support a terabyte multiply by five which gives  million per
year for a supported terabyte of data

                                 


DISCUSSION  Tapes saved by ACS are the typography files originally
supporting publication of the journal  Cost of building tagged text into
the database 


During the questionandanswer period that followed WEIBELs
presentation these clarifications emerged  The tapes saved by the
American Chemical Society are the typography files that originally
supported the publication of the journal  Although they are not tagged
in SGML they are tagged in very fine detail  Every single sentence is
marked all the registry numbers all the publications issues dates and
volumes  No cost figures on tagging material on a permegabyte basis
were available  Because ACSs typesetting system runs from tagged text
there is no extra cost per article  It was unknown what it costs ACS to
keyboard the tagged text rather than just keyboard the text in the
cheapest process  In other words since one intends to publish things
and will need to build tagged text into a typography system in any case
if one does that in such a way that it can drive not only typography but
an electronic system which is what ACS intends to domove to SGML
publishing the marginal cost is zero  The marginal cost represents the
cost of building tagged text into the database which is small

                                 


SPERBERGMcQUEEN  Distinction between texts and computers  Implications
of recognizing that all representation is encoding  Dealing with
complicated representations of text entails the need for a grammar of
documents  Variety of forms of formal grammars  Text as a bitmapped
image does not represent a serious attempt to represent text in
electronic form  SGML the TEI documenttype declarations and the
reusability and longevity of data  TEI conformance explicitly allows
extension or modification of the TEI tag set  Administrative background
of the TEI  Several design goals for the TEI tag set  An absolutely
fixed requirement of the TEI Guidelines  Challenges the TEI has
attempted to face  Good texts not beyond economic feasibility  The
issue of reproducibility or processability  The issue of mages as
simulacra for the text redux  Ones model of text determines what ones
software can do with a text and has economic consequences 


Prior to speaking about SGML and markup Michael SPERBERGMcQUEEN editor
Text Encoding Initiative TEI University of IllinoisChicago first drew
a distinction between texts and computers  Texts are abstract cultural
and linguistic objects while computers are complicated physical devices
he said  Abstract objects cannot be placed inside physical devices with
computers one can only represent text and act upon those representations

The recognition that all representation is encoding SPERBERGMcQUEEN
argued leads to the recognition of two things   The topic description
for this session is slightly misleading because there can be no discussion
of pros and cons of textcoding unless what one means is pros and cons of
working with text with computers   No text can be represented in a
computer without some sort of encoding images are one way of encoding text
ASCII is another SGML yet another  There is no encoding without some
information loss that is there is no perfect reproduction of a text that
allows one to do away with the original  Thus the question becomes
What is the most useful representation of text for a serious work?
This depends on what kind of serious work one is talking about

The projects demonstrated the previous day all involved highly complex
information and fairly complex manipulation of the textual material
In order to use that complicated information one has to calculate it
slowly or manually and store the result  It needs to be stored therefore
as part of ones representation of the text  Thus one needs to store the
structure in the text  To deal with complicated representations of text
one needs somehow to control the complexity of the representation of a text
that means one needs a way of finding out whether a document and an
electronic representation of a document is legal or not and that
means one needs a grammar of documents

SPERBERGMcQUEEN discussed the variety of forms of formal grammars
implicit and explicit as applied to text and their capabilities  He
argued that these grammars correspond to different models of text that
different developers have  For example one implicit model of the text
is that there is no internal structure but just one thing after another
a few characters and then perhaps a starttitle command and then a few
more characters and an endtitle command  SPERBERGMcQUEEN also
distinguished several kinds of text that have a sort of hierarchical
structure that is not very well defined which typically corresponds
to grammars that are not very well defined as well as hierarchies that
are very well defined eg the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae and extremely
complicated things such as SGML which handle strictly hierarchical data
very nicely

SPERBERGMcQUEEN conceded that one other model not illustrated on his two
displays was the model of text as a bitmapped image an image of a page
and confessed to having been converted to a limited extent by the
Workshop to the view that electronic images constitute a promising
probably superior alternative to microfilming  But he was not convinced
that electronic images represent a serious attempt to represent text in
electronic form  Many of their problems stem from the fact that they are
not direct attempts to represent the text but attempts to represent the
page thus making them representations of representations

In this situation of increasingly complicated textual information and the
need to control that complexity in a useful way which begs the question
of the need for good textual grammars one has the introduction of SGML
With SGML one can develop specific documenttype declarations
for specific text types or as with the TEI attempts to generate
general documenttype declarations that can handle all sorts of text
The TEI is an attempt to develop formats for text representation that
will ensure the kind of reusability and longevity of data discussed earlier
It offers a way to stay alive in the state of permanent technological
revolution

It has been a continuing challenge in the TEI to create document grammars
that do some work in controlling the complexity of the textual object but
also allowing one to represent the real text that one will find
Fundamental to the notion of the TEI is that TEI conformance allows one
the ability to extend or modify the TEI tag set so that it fits the text
that one is attempting to represent

SPERBERGMcQUEEN next outlined the administrative background of the TEI
The TEI is an international project to develop and disseminate guidelines
for the encoding and interchange of machinereadable text  It is
sponsored by the Association for Computers in the Humanities the
Association for Computational Linguistics and the Association for
Literary and Linguistic Computing  Representatives of numeroOX HPMSE
