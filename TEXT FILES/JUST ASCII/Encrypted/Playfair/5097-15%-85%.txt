Ukraine Economy

Overview
    Because of its size geographic location Slavic population and rich
    resources the loss of Ukraine was the final and most bitter blow to the
    Soviet leaders wishing to preserve some semblance of the old political
    military and economic power of the USSR After Russia the Ukrainian
    republic was far and away the most important economic component of the
    former Soviet Union producing more than three times the output of the
    nextranking republic Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth
    of Soviet agricultural output and its farms provided substantial quantities
    of meat milk grain and vegetables to other republics Likewise its
    welldeveloped and diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw
    materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the USSR In
    early  the continued wholesale disruption of economic ties and the lack
    of an institutional structure necessary to formulate and implement economic
    reforms preclude a nearterm recovery of output

    transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to
    a modern state with a high standard of living At present levels of
    production crude oil reserves should last for over  years
