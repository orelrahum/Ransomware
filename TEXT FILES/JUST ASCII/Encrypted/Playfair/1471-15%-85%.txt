Overview
    Almost  of GDP comes from the agricultural sector coffee and tea make up
     of total exports The amount of fertile land is limited however and
    deforestation and soil erosion have created problems The industrial sector
    in Rwanda is small contributing only  to GDP Manufacturing focuses
    mainly on the processing of agricultural products The Rwandan economy
    remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid Weak international
    prices since  have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
    decline A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
    October  An outbreak of insurgency also in October has dampened any
    prospects for economic improvement
