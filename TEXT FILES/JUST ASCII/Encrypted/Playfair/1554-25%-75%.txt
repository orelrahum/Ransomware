Colombia Economy

Overview
    Economic development has slowed gradually since  but growth rates
    remain high by Latin American standards Conservative economic policies have
    kept inflation and unemployment near  and  respectively The rapid
    development of oil coal and other nontraditional industries over the past
    four years has helped to offset the decline in coffee prices  Colombias
    major export The collapse of the International Coffee Agreement in the
    summer of  a troublesome rural insurgency and drugrelated violence
    have dampened growth but significant economic reforms are likely to
    facilitate a resurgent economy in the medium term These reforms center on
    fiscal restraint trade liberalization and privatization of state utilities

    that have poor transportation links a young and rapidly increasing
    population and few natural resources The low educational level of the

    unemployment and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical
    assistance Agriculture including fishing hunting and forestry is the
    leading sector of the economy It contributes about  to GDP employs 
    of the labor force and provides most of the exports The country is not
    selfsufficient in food production and rice the main staple accounts for
     of imports During the period  the industrial sector grew at an
    annual average rate of  but its contribution to GDP was only  in
     Despite major investment in the tourist industry which accounts for
    about  of GDP growth has stagnated since  A sluggish growth rate of
     during  has led to large budget deficits declining incomes and
    balanceofpayments difficulties Preliminary estimates for  show a
    moderate increase in the growth rate based on increased exports tourism

Congo Economy

Overview
    Congos economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts a
    beginning industrial sector based largely on oil supporting services and a
    government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing A reform
    program supported by the IMF and World Bank ran into difficulties in
     because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and
    a heavy debtservicing burden Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay
    of the economy providing about twothirds of government revenues and
    exports In the early s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to
    finance largescale development projects with growth averaging  annually
    one of the highest rates in Africa During the period  however
    growth has slowed to an average of roughly  annually only half the
    population growth rate

Cook Islands Economy

Overview
    Agriculture provides the economic base The major export earners are fruit
    copra and clothing Manufacturing activities are limited to a
    fruitprocessing plant and several clothing factories Economic development
    is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack
    of natural resources and good transportation links A large trade deficit is
    annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid
    Current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
    and expanding the fishing industry
