standardized format  He wondered if a similar movement was taking place
in the humanities  Although the National Library of Medicine found only
a few publishers to cooperate in a like venture two or three years ago a
new effort might generate a much larger number willing to cooperate

KIMBALL recounted his units MachineReadable Collections Reading Room
troubles with the commercial publishers of electronic media in acquiring
materials for LCs collections in particular the publishers fear that
they would not be able to cover their costs and would lose control of
their products that LC would give them away or sell them and make
profits from them  He doubted that the publishing industry was prepared
to move into this area at the moment given its resistance to allowing LC
to use its machinereadable materials as the Library would like

The copyright law now addresses compact disk as a medium and LC can
request one copy of that or two copies if it is the only version and
can request copies of software but that fails to address magazines or
books or anything like that which is in machinereadable form

GIFFORD acknowledged the thorny nature of this issue which he illustrated
with the example of the cumbersome process involved in putting a copy of a
scientific database on a LAN in LCs science reading room  He also
acknowledged that LC needs help and could enlist the energies and talents
of Workshop participants in thinking through a number of these problems

GIFFORD returned the discussion to getting the image and text people to
think through together where they want to go in the long term  MYLONAS
conceded that her experience at the Pierce Symposium the previous week at
Georgetown University and this week at LC had forced her to reevaluate
her perspective on the usefulness of text as images  MYLONAS framed the
issues in a series of questions  How do we acquire machinereadable
text?  Do we take pictures of it and perform OCR on it later?  Is it
important to obtain very highquality images and text etc?
FLEISCHHAUER agreed with MYLONASs framing of strategic questions adding
that a large institution such as LC probably has to do all of those
things at different times  Thus the trick is to exercise judgment  The
Workshop had added to his and AMs considerations in making those
judgments  Concerning future meetings or discussions MYLONAS suggested
that screening priorities would be helpful

WEIBEL opined that the diversity reflected in this group was a sign both
of the health and of the immaturity of the field and more time would
have to pass before we convince one another concerning standards

An exchange between MYLONAS and BATTIN clarified the point that the
driving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects was
the preservation of knowledge for the future not simply for particular
research use  In the case of Perseus MYLONAS said the assumption was
that the texts would not be entered again into electronically readable
form  SPERBERGMcQUEEN added that a scanned image would not serve as an
archival copy for purposes of preservation in the case of say the Bill
of Rights in the sense that the scanned images are effectively the
archival copies for the Cornell mathematics books

SESSION I

Avra MICHELSON           Forecasting the Use of Electronic Texts by
                         Social Sciences and Humanities Scholars

This presentation explores the ways in which electronic texts are likely
to be used by the nonscientific scholarly community  Many of the
remarks are drawn from a report the speaker coauthored with Jeff
Rothenberg a computer scientist at The RAND Corporation

The speaker assesses  current scholarly use of information technology
and  the key trends in information technology most relevant to the
research process in order to predict how social sciences and humanities
scholars are apt to use electronic texts  In introducing the topic
current use of electronic texts is explored broadly within the context of
scholarly communication  From the perspective of scholarly
communication the work of humanities and social sciences scholars
involves five processes   identification of sources  communication
with colleagues  interpretation and analysis of data  dissemination
of research findings and  curriculum development and instruction  The
extent to which computation currently permeates aspects of scholarly
communication represents a viable indicator of the prospects for
electronic texts

The discussion of current practice is balanced by an analysis of key
trends in the scholarly use of information technology  These include the
trends toward enduser computing and connectivity which provide a
framework for forecasting the use of electronic texts through this
millennium  The presentation concludes with a summary of the ways in
which the nonscientific scholarly community can be expected to use
electronic texts and the implications of that use for information
providers

Susan VECCIA and Joanne FREEMAN    Electronic Archives for the Public
                                   Use of American Memory in Public and
                                   School Libraries

This joint discussion focuses on nonscholarly applications of electronic
library materials specifically addressing use of the Library of Congress
American Memory AM program in a small number of public and school
libraries throughout the United States  AM consists of selected Library
of Congress primary archival materials stored on optical media
CDROMvideodisc and presented with little or no editing  Many
collections are accompanied by electronic introductions and users guides
offering background information and historical context  Collections
represent a variety of formats including photographs graphic arts
motion pictures recorded sound music broadsides and manuscripts
books and pamphlets

In  the Library of Congress began a nationwide evaluation of AM in
different types of institutions  Test sites include public libraries
elementary and secondary school libraries college and university
libraries state libraries and special libraries  Susan VECCIA and
Joanne FREEMAN will discuss their observations on the use of AM by the
nonscholarly community using evidence gleaned from this ongoing
evaluation effort

VECCIA will comment on the overall goals of the evaluation project and
the types of public and school libraries included in this study  Her
comments on nonscholarly use of AM will focus on the public library as a
cultural and community institution often bridging the gap between formal
and informal education  FREEMAN will discuss the use of AM in school
libraries  Use by students and teachers has revealed some broad
questions about the use of electronic resources as well as definite
benefits gained by the "nonscholar"  Topics will include the problem of
grasping content and context in an electronic environment the stumbling
blocks created by "new" technologies and the unique skills and interests
awakened through use of electronic resources

SESSION II

Elli MYLONAS             The Perseus Project  Interactive Sources and
                         Studies in Classical Greece

The Perseus Project  has just released Perseus  the first publicly
available version of its hypertextual database of multimedia materials on
classical Greece  Perseus is designed to be used by a wide audience
comprised of readers at the student and scholar levels  As such it must
be able to locate information using different strategies and it must
contain enough detail to serve the different needs of its users  In
addition it must be delivered so that it is affordable to its target
audience  These problems and the solutions we chose are described in
Mylonas "An Interface to Classical Greek Civilization" JASIS 
March 

In order to achieve its objective the project staff decided to make a
conscious separation between selecting and converting textual database
and image data on the one hand and putting it into a delivery system on
the other  That way it is possible to create the electronic data
without thinking about the restrictions of the delivery system  We have
made a great effort to choose systemindependent formats for our data
and to put as much thought and work as possible into structuring it so
that the translation from paper to electronic form will enhance the value
of the data A discussion of these solutions as of two years ago is in
Elli Mylonas Gregory Crane Kenneth Morrell and D Neel Smith "The
Perseus Project  Data in the Electronic Age" in Accessing Antiquity
The Computerization of Classical Databases J Solomon and T Worthen
eds  University of Arizona Press in press

Much of the work on Perseus is focused on collecting and converting the
data on which the project is based  At the same time it is necessary to
provide means of access to the information in order to make it usable
and them to investigate how it is used  As we learn more about what
students and scholars from different backgrounds do with Perseus we can
adjust our data collection and also modify the system to accommodate
them  In creating a delivery system for general use we have tried to
avoid favoring any one type of use by allowing multiple forms of access
to and navigation through the system

The way text is handled exemplifies some of these principles  All text
in Perseus is tagged using SGML following the guidelines of the Text
Encoding Initiative TEI  This markup is used to index the text and
process it so that it can be imported into HyperCard  No SGML markup
remains in the text that reaches the user because currently it would be
too expensive to create a system that acts on SGML in real time
However the regularity provided by SGML is essential for verifying the
content of the texts and greatly speeds all the processing performed on
them  The fact that the texts exist in SGML ensures that they will be
relatively easy to port to different hardware and software and so will
outlast the current delivery platform  Finally the SGML markup
incorporates existing canonical reference systems chapter verse line
etc indexing and navigation are based on these features  This ensures
that the same canonical reference will always resolve to the same point
within a text and that all versions of our texts regardless of delivery
platform even paper printouts will function the same way

In order to provide tools for users the text is processed by a
morphological analyzer and the results are stored in a database
Together with the index the GreekEnglish Lexicon and the index of all
the English words in the definitions of the lexicon the morphological
analyses comprise a set of linguistic tools that allow users of all
levels to work with the textual information and to accomplish different
tasks  For example students who read no Greek may explore a concept as
it appears in Greek texts by using the EnglishGreek index and then
looking up works in the texts and translations or scholars may do
detailed morphological studies of word use by using the morphological
analyses of the texts  Because these tools were not designed for any one
use the same tools and the same data can be used by both students and
scholars

NOTES
       Perseus is based at Harvard University with collaborators at
     several other universities  The project has been funded primarily
     by the AnnenbergCPB Project as well as by Harvard University
     Apple Computer and others  It is published by Yale University
     Press  Perseus runs on Macintosh computers under the HyperCard
     program

Eric CALALUCA

ChadwyckHealey embarked last year on two distinct yet related fulltext
humanities database projects

The English Poetry FullText Database and the Patrologia Latina Database
represent new approaches to linguistic research resources  The size and
complexity of the projects present problems for electronic publishers
but surmountable ones if they remain abreast of the latest possibilities
in data capture and retrieval software techniques

The issues which required address prior to the commencement of the
projects were legion

        Editorial selection or exclusion of materials in each
          database

        Deciding whether or not to incorporate a normative encoding
          structure into the databases?
               A  If one is selected should it be SGML?
               B  If SGML then the TEI?

        Deliver as CDROM magnetic tape or both?

        Can one produce retrieval software advanced enough for the
          postdoctoral linguist yet accessible enough for unattended
          general use?  Should one try?

        Re fair and liberal networking policies what are the risks to
          an electronic publisher?

        How does the emergence of national and international education
          networks affect the use and viability of research projects
          requiring high investment?  Do the new European Community
          directives concerning database protection necessitate two
          distinct publishing projects one for North America and one for
          overseas?

From new notions of "scholarly fair use" to the future of optical media
virtually every issue related to electronic publishing was aired  The
result is two projects which have been constructed to provide the quality
research resources with the fewest encumbrances to use by teachers and
private scholars

Dorothy TWOHIG

In spring  the editors of the papers of George Washington John
Adams Thomas Jefferson James Madison and Benjamin Franklin were
approached by classics scholar David Packard on behalf of the Packard
Humanities Foundation with a proposal to produce a CDROM edition of the
complete papers of each of the Founding Fathers  This electronic edition
will supplement the published volumes making the documents widely
available to students and researchers at reasonable cost  We estimate
that our CDROM edition of Washingtons Papers will be substantially
completed within the next two years and ready for publication  Within
the next ten years or so similar CDROM editions of the Franklin Adams
Jefferson and Madison papers also will be available  At the Library of
Congresss session on technology I would like to discuss not only the
experience of the Washington Papers in producing the CDROM edition but
the impact technology has had on these major editorial projects
Already we are editing our volumes with an eye to the material that will
be readily available in the CDROM edition  The completed electronic
edition will provide immense possibilities for the searching of documents
for information in a way never possible before  The kind of technical
innovations that are currently available and on the drawing board will
soon revolutionize historical research and the production of historical
documents  Unfortunately much of this new technology is not being used
in the planning stages of historical projects simply because many
historians are aware only in the vaguest way of its existence  At least
two major new historical editing projects are considering microfilm
editions simply because they are not aware of the possibilities of
electronic alternatives and the advantages of the new technology in terms
of flexibility and research potential compared to microfilm  In fact
too many of us in history and literature are still at the stage of
struggling with our PCs  There are many historical editorial projects in
progress presently and an equal number of literary projects  While the
two fields have somewhat different approaches to textual editing there
are ways in which electronic technology can be of service to both

Since few of the editors involved in the Founding Fathers CDROM editions
are technical experts in any sense I hope to point out in my discussion
of our experience how many of these electronic innovations can be used
successfully by scholars who are novices in the world of new technology
One of the major concerns of the sponsors of the multitude of new
scholarly editions is the limited audience reached by the published
volumes  Most of these editions are being published in small quantities
and the publishers price for them puts them out of the reach not only of
individual scholars but of most public libraries and all but the largest
educational institutions  However little attention is being given to
ways in which technology can bypass conventional publication to make
historical and literary documents more widely available

What attracted us most to the CDROM edition of The Papers of George
Washington was the fact that David Packards aim was to make a complete
edition of all of the  documents we have collected available in an
inexpensive format that would be placed in public libraries small
colleges and even high schools  This would provide an audience far
beyond our present copy  published edition  Since the CDROM
edition will carry none of the explanatory annotation that appears in the
published volumes we also feel that the use of the CDROM will lead many
researchers to seek out the published volumes

In addition to ignorance of new technical advances I have found that too
many editorsand historians and literary scholarsare resistant and
even hostile to suggestions that electronic technology may enhance their
work  I intend to discuss some of the arguments traditionalists are
advancing to resist technology ranging from distrust of the speed with
which it changes we are already wondering what is out there that is
better than CDROM to suspicion of the technical language used to
describe electronic developments

Cornell University Library Cornell Information Technologies and Xerox
Corporation with the support of the Commission on Preservation and
Access and Sun Microsystems Inc have been collaborating in a project
to test a prototype system for recording brittle books as digital images
and producing on demand highquality archival paper replacements  The
project goes beyond that however to investigate some of the issues
surrounding scanning storing retrieving and providing access to
digital images in a network environment

The Joint Study in Digital Preservation began in January   Xerox
provided the College Library Access and Storage System CLASS software
a prototype dotsperinch dpi scanner and the hardware necessary
to support network printing on the DocuTech printer housed in Cornells
Computing and Communications Center CCC

The Cornell staff using the hardware and software became an integral part
of the development and testing process for enhancements to the CLASS
software system  The collaborative nature of this relationship is
resulting in a system that is specifically tailored to the preservation
application

A digital library of  volumes or approximately  images has
been created and is stored on an optical jukebox that resides in CCC
The library includes a collection of select mathematics monographs that
provides mathematics faculty with an opportunity to use the electronic
library  The remaining volumes were chosen for the library to test the
various capabilities of the scanning system

One project objective is to provide users of the Cornell library and the
library staff with the ability to request facsimiles of digitized images
or to retrieve the actual electronic image for browsing  A prototype
viewing workstation has been created by Xerox with input into the design
by a committee of Cornell librarians and computer professionals  This
will allow us to experiment with patron access to the images that make up
the digital library  The viewing station provides search retrieval and
ultimately printing functions with enhancements to facilitate
navigation through multiple documents

Cornell currently is working to extend access to the digital library to
readers using workstations from their offices  This year is devoted to
the development of a network resident image conversion and delivery
server and client software that will support readers who use Apple
Macintosh computers IBM windows platforms and Sun workstations
Equipment for this development was provided by Sun Microsystems with
support from the Commission on Preservation and Access

During the showandtell session of the Workshop on Electronic Texts a
prototype view station will be demonstrated  In addition a display of
original library books that have been digitized will be available for
review with associated printed copies for comparison  The fifteenminute
overview of the project will include a slide presentation that
constitutes a "tour" of the preservation digitizing process

The final networkconnected version of the viewing station will provide
library users with another mechanism for accessing the digital library
and will also provide the capability of viewing images directly  This
will not require special software although a powerful computer with good
graphics will be needed

The Joint Study in Digital Preservation has generated a great deal of
interest in the library community  Unfortunately or perhaps
fortunately this project serves to raise a vast number of other issues
surrounding the use of digital technology for the preservation and use of
deteriorating library materials which subsequent projects will need to
examine  Much work remains

SESSION III

Howard BESSER                      Networking Multimedia Databases

What do we have to consider in building and distributing databases of
visual materials in a multiuser environment?  This presentation examines
a variety of concerns that need to be addressed before a multimedia
database can be set up in a networked environment

In the past it has not been feasible to implement databases of visual
materials in shareduser environments because of technological barriers
Each of the two basic models for multiuser multimedia databases has
posed its own problem  The analog multimedia storage model represented
by Project Athenas parallel analog and digital networks has required an
incredibly complex and expensive infrastructure  The economies HZ
