before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child
for I never was so small as this before never  And I declare
its too bad that it is

moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water  He first
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that
case I can go back by railway she said to herself  Alice had
been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general
