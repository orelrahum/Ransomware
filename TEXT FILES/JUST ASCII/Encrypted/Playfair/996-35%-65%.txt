Overview
    The mainstay of Andorras economy is tourism An estimated  million

    of arable land and most food has to be imported The principal livestock
    activity is sheep raising Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes
    cigars and furniture The rapid pace of European economic integration is a
    potential threat to Andorras advantages from its dutyfree status
