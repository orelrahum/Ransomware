Afghanistan Economy

Overview
    Fundamentally Afghanistan is an extremely poor landlocked country highly
    dependent on farming wheat especially and livestock raising sheep and

    the nearly year Soviet military occupation which ended  February
     Over the past decade onethird of the population fled the country
    with Pakistan sheltering more than  million refugees and Iran about 
    million Another  million probably moved into and around urban areas within
    Afghanistan Although reliable data are unavailable gross domestic product
    is lower than  years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the
