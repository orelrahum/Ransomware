          And mentioned me to him
        She gave me a good character
          But said I could not swim

        He sent them word I had not gone
          We know it to be true
        If she should push the matter on
          What would become of you?

        I gave her one they gave him two
          You gave us three or more
        They all returned from him to you
          Though they were mine before

        If I or she should chance to be
          Involved in this affair
        He trusts to you to set them free
          Exactly as we were

        My notion was that you had been
          Before she had this fit
        An obstacle that came between
          Him and ourselves and it

        Dont let him know she liked them best
          For this must ever be
        A secret kept from all the rest
          Between yourself and me

  Thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet
said the King rubbing his hands so now let the jury

  If any one of them can explain it said Alice she had
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit
afraid of interrupting him Ill give him sixpence  I dont
believe theres an atom of meaning in it

  The jury all wrote down on their slates SHE doesnt believe
theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to
explain the paper

  If theres no meaning in it said the King that saves a
world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any  And
yet I dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his
knee and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some
meaning in them after all  "SAID I COULD NOT SWIM" you
cant swim can you? he added turning to the Knave

  The Knave shook his head sadly  Do I look like it? he said
Which he certainly did NOT being made entirely of cardboard

  All right so far said the King and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself  "WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE" thats
the jury of course "I GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO" why
that must be what he did with the tarts you know

  But it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU" said
Alice

  Why there they are said the King triumphantly pointing to
the tarts on the table  Nothing can be clearer than THAT
Then again"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT"  you never had fits my
dear I think? he said to the Queen

  Never said the Queen furiously throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke  The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger as he found it made no
mark but he now hastily began again using the ink that was
trickling down his face as long as it lasted

  Then the words dont FIT you said the King looking round
the court with a smile  There was a dead silence

  Its a pun the King added in an offended tone and
everybody laughed Let the jury consider their verdict the
King said for about the twentieth time that day

  No no said the Queen  Sentence firstverdict afterwards

  Stuff and nonsense said Alice loudly  The idea of having
the sentence first

  Hold your tongue said the Queen turning purple

  I wont said Alice

  Off with her head the Queen shouted at the top of her voice
Nobody moved

  Who cares for you? said Alice she had grown to her full
size by this time  Youre nothing but a pack of cards

  At this the whole pack rose up into the air and came flying
down upon her  she gave a little scream half of fright and half
of anger and tried to beat them off and found herself lying on
the bank with her head in the lap of her sister who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face

  Wake up Alice dear said her sister Why what a long
sleep youve had

  Oh Ive had such a curious dream said Alice and she told
her sister as well as she could remember them all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and
when she had finished her sister kissed her and said It WAS a
curious dream dear certainly  but nUD CNA UD ZM XWHN PQK UPB
