To idols foul Thammuz came next behind
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate
In amorous ditties all a summers day
While smooth Adonis from his native rock
Ran purple to the sea supposed with blood
Of Thammuz yearly wounded the lovetale
Infected Sions daughters with like heat
Whose wanton passions in the sacred proch
Ezekiel saw when by the vision led
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries
Of alienated Judah Next came one
Who mourned in earnest when the captive ark
Maimed his brute image head and hands lopt off
In his own temple on the grunseledge
Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers
Dagon his name seamonsterupward man
And downward fish yet had his temple high
Reared in Azotus dreaded through the coast
Of Palestine in Gath and Ascalon
And Accaron and Gazas frontier bounds
Him followed Rimmon whose delightful seat
Was fair Damascus on the fertile banks
Of Abbana and Pharphar lucid streams
He also against the house of God was bold
A leper once he lost and gained a king
Ahaz his sottish conqueror whom he drew
Gods altar to disparage and displace
For one of Syrian mode whereon to burn
His odious offerings and adore the gods
Whom he had vanquished After these appeared
A crew who under names of old renown
Osiris Isis Orus and their train
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
Rather than human Nor did Israel scape
Th infection when their borrowed gold composed
The calf in Oreb and the rebel king
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox
Jehovah who in one night when he passed
From Egypt marching equalled with one stroke
Both her firstborn and all her bleating gods
Belial came last than whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven or more gross to love
Vice for itself To him no temple stood
Or altar smoked yet who more oft than he
In temples and at altars when the priest
Turns atheist as did Elis sons who filled
With lust and violence the house of God?
In courts and palaces he also reigns
And in luxurious cities where the noise
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers
And injury and outrage and when night
Darkens the streets then wander forth the sons
Of Belial flown with insolence and wine
Witness the streets of Sodom and that night
In Gibeah when the hospitable door
Exposed a matron to avoid worse rape
  These were the prime in order and in might
The rest were long to tell though far renowned
Th Ionian godsof Javans issue held
Gods yet confessed later than Heaven and Earth
Their boasted parentsTitan Heavens firstborn
With his enormous brood and birthright seized
By younger Saturn he from mightier Jove
His own and Rheas son like measure found
So Jove usurping reigned These first in Crete
And Ida known thence on the snowy top
Of cold Olympus ruled the middle air
Their highest heaven or on the Delphian cliff
Or in Dodona and through all the bounds
Of Doric land or who with Saturn old
Fled over Adria to th Hesperian fields
And oer the Celtic roamed the utmost Isles
  All these and more came flocking but with looks
Downcast and damp yet such wherein appeared
Obscure some glimpse of joy to have found their Chief
Not in despair to have found themselves not lost
In loss itself which on his countenance cast
Like doubtful hue But he his wonted pride
Soon recollecting with high words that bore
Semblance of worth not substance gently raised
Their fainting courage and dispelled their fears
Then straight commands that at the warlike sound
Of trumpets loud and clarions be upreared
His mighty standard That proud honour claimed
Azazel as his right a Cherub tall
Who forthwith from the glittering staff unfurled
Th imperial ensign which full high advanced
Shone like a meteor streaming to the wind
With gems and golden lustre rich emblazed
Seraphic arms and trophies all the while
Sonorous metal blowing martial sounds
At which the universal host upsent
A shout that tore Hells concave and beyond
Frighted the reign of Chaos and old Night
All in a moment through the gloom were seen
Ten thousand banners rise into the air
With orient colours waving with them rose
A forest huge of spears and thronging helms
Appeared and serried shields in thick array
Of depth immeasurable Anon they move
In perfect phalanx to the Dorian mood
Of flutes and soft recorderssuch as raised
To height of noblest temper heroes old
Arming to battle and instead of rage
Deliberate valour breathed firm and unmoved
With dread of death to flight or foul retreat
Nor wanting power to mitigate and swage
With solemn touches troubled thoughts and chase
Anguish and doubt and fear and sorrow and pain
From mortal or immortal minds Thus they
Breathing united force with fixed thought
Moved on in silence to soft pipes that charmed
Their painful steps oer the burnt soil And now
Advanced in view they standa horrid front
Of dreadful length and dazzling arms in guise
Of warriors old with ordered spear and shield
Awaiting what command their mighty Chief
Had to impose He through the armed files
Darts his experienced eye and soon traverse
The whole battalion viewstheir order due
Their visages and stature as of gods
Their number last he sums And now his heart
Distends with pride and hardening in his strength
Glories for never since created Man
Met such embodied force as named with these
Could merit more than that small infantry
Warred on by cranesthough all the giant brood
Of Phlegra with th heroic race were joined
That fought at Thebes and Ilium on each side
Mixed with auxiliar gods and what resounds
In fable or romance of Uthers son
Begirt with British and Armoric knights
And all who since baptized or infidel
Jousted in Aspramont or Montalban
Damasco or Marocco or Trebisond
Or whom Biserta sent from Afric shore
When Charlemain with all his peerage fell
By Fontarabbia Thus far these beyond
Compare of mortal prowess yet observed
Their dread Commander He above the rest
In shape and gesture proudly eminent
Stood like a tower His form had yet not lost
All her original brightness nor appeared
Less than Archangel ruined and th excess
Of glory obscured as when the sun newrisen
Looks through the horizontal misty air
Shorn of his beams or from behind the moon
In dim eclipse disastrous twilight sheds
On half the nations and with fear of change
Perplexes monarchs Darkened so yet shone
Above them all th Archangel but his face
Deep scars of thunder had intrenched and care
Sat on his faded cheek but under brows
Of dauntless courage and considerate pride
Waiting revenge Cruel his eye but cast
Signs of remorse and passion to behold
The fellows of his crime the followers rather
Far other once beheld in bliss condemned
For ever now to have their lot in pain
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced
Of Heaven and from eteranl splendours flung
For his revoltyet faithful how they stood
Their glory withered as when heavens fire
Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines
With singed top their stately growth though bare
Stands on the blasted heath He now prepared
To speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend
From wing to wing and half enclose him round
With all his peers attention held them mute
Thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn
Tears such as Angels weep burst forth at last
Words interwove with sighs found out their way
  "O myriads of immortal Spirits O Powers
Matchless but with th Almighthand that strife
Was not inglorious though th event was dire
As this place testifies and this dire change
Hateful to utter But what power of mind
Forseeing or presaging from the depth
Of knowledge past or present could have feared
How such united force of gods how such
As stood like these could ever know repulse?
For who can yet believe though after loss
That all these puissant legions whose exile
Hath emptied Heaven shall fail to reascend
Selfraised and repossess their native seat?
For me be witness all the host of Heaven
If counsels different or danger shunned
By me have lost our hopes But he who reigns
Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure
Sat on his throne upheld by old repute
Consent or custom and his regal state
Put forth at full but still his strength concealed
Which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall
Henceforth his might we know and know our own
So as not either to provoke or dread
New war provoked our better part remains
To work in close design by fraud or guile
What force effected not that he no less
At length from us may find who overcomes
By force hath overcome but half his foe
Space may produce new Worlds whereof so rife
There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long
Intended to create and therein plant
A generation whom his choice regard
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven
Thither if but to pry shall be perhaps
Our first eruptionthither or elsewhere
For this infernal pit shall never hold
Celestial Spirits in bondage nor th Abyss
Long under darkness cover But these thoughts
Full counsel must mature Peace is despaired
For who can think submission? War then war
Open or understood must be resolved"
  He spake and to confirm his words outflew
Millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs
Of mighty Cherubim the sudden blaze
Far round illumined Hell Highly they raged
Against the Highest and fierce with grasped arms
Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven
  There stood a hill not far whose grisly top
Belched fire and rolling smoke the rest entire
Shone with a glossy scurfundoubted sign
That in his womb was hid metallic ore
The work of sulphur Thither winged with speed
A numerous brigade hastened as when bands
Of pioneers with spade and pickaxe armed
Forerun the royal camp to trench a field
Or cast a rampart Mammon led them on
Mammon the least erected Spirit that fell
From Heaven for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts
Were always downward bent admiring more
The riches of heavens pavement trodden gold
Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed
In vision beatific By him first
Men also and by his suggestion taught
Ransacked the centre and with impious hands
Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth
For treasures better hid Soon had his crew
Opened into the hill a spacious wound
And digged out ribs of gold Let none admire
That riches grow in Hell that soil may best
Deserve the precious bane And here let those
Who boast in mortal things and wondering tell
Of Babel and the works of Memphian kings
Learn how their greatest monuments of fame
And strength and art are easily outdone
By Spirits reprobate and in an hour
What in an age they with incessant toil
And hands innumerable scarce perform
Nigh on the plain in many cells prepared
That underneath had veins of liquid fire
Sluiced from the lake a second multitude
With wondrous art founded the massy ore
Severing each kind and scummed the bulliondross
A third as soon had formed within the ground
A various mould and from the boiling cells
By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook
As in an organ from one blast of wind
To many a row of pipes the soundboard breathes
Anon out of the earth a fabric huge
Rose like an exhalation with the sound
Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet
Built like a temple where pilasters round
Were set and Doric pillars overlaid
With golden architrave nor did there want
Cornice or frieze with bossy sculptures graven
The roof was fretted gold Not Babylon
Nor great Alcairo such magnificence
Equalled in all their glories to enshrine
Belus or Serapis their gods or seat
Their kings when Egypt with Assyria strove
In wealth and luxury Th ascending pile
Stood fixed her stately height and straight the doors
Opening their brazen folds discover wide
Within her ample spaces oer the smooth
And level pavement from the arched roof
Pendent by subtle magic many a row
Of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed
With naptha and asphaltus yielded light
As from a sky The hasty multitude
Admiring entered and the work some praise
And some the architect His hand was known
In Heaven by many a towered structure high
Where sceptred Angels held their residence
And sat as Princes whom the supreme King
Exalted to such power and gave to rule
Each in his Hierarchy the Orders bright
Nor was his name unheard or unadored
In ancient Greece and in Ausonian land
Men called him Mulciber and how he fell
From Heaven they fabled thrown by angry Jove
Sheer oer the crystal battlements from morn
To noon he fell from noon to dewy eve
A summers day and with the setting sun
Dropt from the zenith like a falling star
On Lemnos th Aegaean isle Thus they relate
Erring for he with this rebellious rout
Fell long before nor aught aviled him now
To have built in Heaven high towers nor did he scape
By all his engines but was headlong sent
With his industrious crew to build in Hell
  Meanwhile the winged Heralds by command
Of sovereign power with awful ceremony
And trumpets sound throughout the host proclaim
A solemn council forthwith to be held
At Pandemonium the high capital
Of Satan and his peers Their summons called
From every band and squared regiment
By place or choice the worthiest they anon
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came
Attended All access was thronged the gates
And porches wide but chief the spacious hall
Though like a covered field where champions bold
Wont ride in armed and at the Soldans chair
Defied the best of Paynim chivalry
To mortal combat or career with lance
Thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air
Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings As bees
In springtime when the Sun with Taurus rides
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
In clusters they among fresh dews and flowers
Fly to and fro or on the smoothed plank
The suburb of their strawbuilt citadel
New rubbed with balm expatiate and confer
Their stateaffairs so thick the airy crowd
Swarmed and were straitened till the signal given
Behold a wonder They but now who seemed
In bigness to surpass Earths giant sons
Now less than smallest dwarfs in narrow room
Throng numberlesslike that pygmean race
Beyond the Indian mount or faery elves
Whose midnight revels by a forestside
Or fountain some belated peasant sees
Or dreams he sees while overhead the Moon
Sits arbitress and nearer to the Earth
Wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance
Intent with jocund music charm his ear
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms
Reduced their shapes immense and were at large
Though without number still amidst the hall
Of that infernal court But far within
And in their own dimensions like themselves
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim
In close recess and secret conclave sat
A thousand demigods on golden seats
Frequent and full After short silence then
And summons read the great consult began



Book II


High on a throne of royal state which far
Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold
Satan exalted sat by merit raised
To that bad eminence and from despair
Thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires
Beyond thus high insatiate to pursue
Vain war with Heaven and by success untaught
His proud imaginations thus displayed
  "Powers and Dominions Deities of Heaven
For since no deep within her gulf can hold
Immortal vigour though oppressed and fallen
I give not Heaven for lost from this descent
Celestial Virtues rising will appear
More glorious and more dread than from no fall
And trust themselves to fear no second fate
Me though just right and the fixed laws of Heaven
Did first create your leadernext free choice
With what besides in council or in fight
Hath been achieved of merityet this loss
Thus far at least recovered hath much more
Established in a safe unenvied throne
Yielded with full consent The happier state
In Heaven which follows dignity might draw
Envy from each inferior but who here
Will envy whom the highest place exposes
Foremost to stand against the Thunderers aim
Your bulwark and condemns to greatest share
Of endless pain? Where there is then no good
For which to strive no strife can grow up there
From faction for none sure will claim in Hell
Precedence none whose portion is so small
Of present pain that with ambitious mind
Will covet more With this advantage then
To union and firm faith and firm accord
More than can be in Heaven we now return
To claim our just inheritance of old
Surer to prosper than prosperity
Could have assured us and by what best way
Whether of open war or covert guile
We now debate Who can advise may speak"
  He ceased and next him Moloch sceptred king
Stood upthe strongest and the fiercest Spirit
That fought in Heaven now fiercer by despair
His trust was with th Eternal to be deemed
Equal in strength and rather than be less
Cared not to be at all with that care lost
Went all his fear of God or Hell or worse
He recked not and these words thereafter spake
  "My sentence is for open war Of wiles
More unexpert I boast not them let those
Contrive who need or when they need not now
For while they sit contriving shall the rest
Millions that stand in arms and longing wait
The signal to ascendsit lingering here
Heavens fugitives and for their dwellingplace
Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame
The prison of his ryranny who reigns
By our delay? No let us rather choose
Armed with Hellflames and fury all at once
Oer Heavens high towers to force resistless way
Turning our tortures into horrid arms
Against the Torturer when to meet the noise
Of his almighty engine he shall hear
Infernal thunder and for lightning see
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
Among his Angels and his throne itself
Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire
His own invented torments But perhaps
The way seems difficult and steep to scale
With upright wing against a higher foe
Let such bethink them if the sleepy drench
Of that forgetful lake benumb not still
That in our porper motion we ascend
Up to our native seat descent and fall
To us is adverse Who but felt of late
When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
Insulting and pursued us through the Deep
With what compulsion and laborious flight
We sunk thus low? Th ascent is easy then
Th event is feared Should we again provoke
Our stronger some worse way his wrath may find
To our destruction if there be in Hell
Fear to be worse destroyed What can be worse
Than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned
In this abhorred deep to utter woe
