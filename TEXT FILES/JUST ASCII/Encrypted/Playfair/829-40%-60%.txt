Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood
As gods and by their own recovered strength
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power
  "Is this the region this the soil the clime"
Said then the lost Archangel "this the seat
That we must change for Heaven?this mournful gloom
For that celestial light? Be it so since he
Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid
What shall be right farthest from him is best
Whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme
Above his equals Farewell happy fields
Where joy for ever dwells Hail horrors hail
Infernal world and thou profoundest Hell
Receive thy new possessorone who brings
A mind not to be changed by place or time
The mind is its own place and in itself
Can make a Heaven of Hell a Hell of Heaven
What matter where if I be still the same
And what I should be all but less than he
Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least
We shall be free th Almighty hath not built
Here for his envy will not drive us hence
Here we may reigh secure and in my choice
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends
Th associates and copartners of our loss
Lie thus astonished on th oblivious pool
And call them not to share with us their part
In this unhappy mansion or once more
With rallied arms to try what may be yet
Regained in Heaven or what more lost in Hell?"
  So Satan spake and him Beelzebub
Thus answered"Leader of those armies bright
Which but th Omnipotent none could have foiled
If once they hear that voice their liveliest pledge
Of hope in fears and dangersheard so oft
In worst extremes and on the perilous edge
Of battle when it raged in all assaults
Their surest signalthey will soon resume
New courage and revive though now they lie
Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire
As we erewhile astounded and amazed
No wonder fallen such a pernicious height"
  He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend
Was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield
Ethereal temper massy large and round
Behind him cast The broad circumference
Hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb
Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views
At evening from the top of Fesole
Or in Valdarno to descry new lands
Rivers or mountains in her spotty globe
His spearto equal which the tallest pine
Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast
Of some great ammiral were but a wand
He walked with to support uneasy steps
Over the burning marl not like those steps
On Heavens azure and the torrid clime
Smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire
Nathless he so endured till on the beach
Of that inflamed sea he stood and called
His legionsAngel Forms who lay entranced
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
In Vallombrosa where th Etrurian shades
High overarched embower or scattered sedge
Afloat when with fierce winds Orion armed
Hath vexed the RedSea coast whose waves oerthrew
Busiris and his Memphian chivalry
While with perfidious hatred they pursued
The sojourners of Goshen who beheld
From the safe shore their floating carcases
And broken chariotwheels So thick bestrown
Abject and lost lay these covering the flood
Under amazement of their hideous change
He called so loud that all the hollow deep
Of Hell resounded"Princes Potentates
Warriors the Flower of Heavenonce yours now lost
If such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal Spirits Or have ye chosen this place
After the toil of battle to repose
Your wearied virtue for the ease you find
To slumber here as in the vales of Heaven?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conqueror who now beholds
Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood
With scattered arms and ensigns till anon
His swift pursuers from Heavengates discern
Th advantage and descending treaN IV RWYW
