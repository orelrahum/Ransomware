Nor after resurrection shall he stay
Longer on earth than certain times to appear
To his disciples men who in his life
Still followed him to them shall leave in charge
To teach all nations what of him they learned
And his salvation them who shall believe
Baptizing in the profluent stream the sign
Of washing them from guilt of sin to life
Pure and in mind prepared if so befall
For death like that which the Redeemer died
All nations they shall teach for from that day
Not only to the sons of Abrahams loins
Salvation shall be preached but to the sons
Of Abrahams faith wherever through the world
So in his seed all nations shall be blest
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend
With victory triumphing through the air
Over his foes and thine there shall surprise
The Serpent prince of air and drag in chains
Through all his realm and there confounded leave
Then enter into glory and resume
His seat at Gods right hand exalted high
Above all names in Heaven and thence shall come
When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe
With glory and power to judge both quick and dead
To judge the unfaithful dead but to reward
His faithful and receive them into bliss
Whether in Heaven or Earth for then the Earth
Shall all be Paradise far happier place
Than this of Eden and far happier days
So spake the ArchAngel Michael then paused
As at the worlds great period and our sire
Replete with joy and wonder thus replied
O Goodness infinite Goodness immense
That all this good of evil shall produce
And evil turn to good more wonderful
Than that which by creation first brought forth
Light out of darkness  Full of doubt I stand
Whether I should repent me now of sin
By me done and occasioned or rejoice
Much more that much more good thereof shall spring
To God more glory more goodwill to Men
From God and over wrath grace shall abound
But say if our Deliverer up to Heaven
Must reascend what will betide the few
His faithful left among the unfaithful herd
The enemies of truth?  Who then shall guide
His people who defend?  Will they not deal
Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?
Be sure they will said the Angel but from Heaven
He to his own a Comforter will send
The promise of the Father who shall dwell
His Spirit within them and the law of faith
Working through love upon their hearts shall write
To guide them in all truth and also arm
With spiritual armour able to resist
Satans assaults and quench his fiery darts
What man can do against them not afraid
Though to the death against such cruelties
With inward consolations recompensed
And oft supported so as shall amaze
Their proudest persecutors  For the Spirit
Poured first on his Apostles whom he sends
To evangelize the nations then on all
Baptized shall them with wonderous gifts endue
To speak all tongues and do all miracles
As did their Lord before them  Thus they win
Great numbers of each nation to receive
With joy the tidings brought from Heaven  At length
Their ministry performed and race well run
Their doctrine and their story written left
They die but in their room as they forewarn
Wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven
To their own vile advantages shall turn
Of lucre and ambition and the truth
With superstitions and traditions taint
Left only in those written records pure
Though not but by the Spirit understood
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names
Places and titles and with these to join
Secular power though feigning still to act
By spiritual to themselves appropriating
The Spirit of God promised alike and given
To all believers and from that pretence
Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force
On every conscience laws which none shall find
Left them inrolled or what the Spirit within
Shall on the heart engrave  What will they then
But force the Spirit of Grace itself and bind
His consort Liberty? what but unbuild
His living temples built by faith to stand
Their own faith not anothers? for on earth
Who against faith and conscience can be heard
Infallible? yet many will presume
Whence heavy persecution shall arise
On all who in the worship persevere
Of spirit and truth the rest far greater part
Will deem in outward rites and specious forms
Religion satisfied Truth shall retire
Bestuck with slanderous darts and works of faith
Rarely be found  So shall the world go on
To good malignant to bad men benign
Under her own weight groaning till the day
Appear of respiration to the just
And vengeance to the wicked at return
Of him so lately promised to thy aid
The Womans Seed obscurely then foretold
Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord
Last in the clouds from Heaven to be revealed
In glory of the Father to dissolve
Satan with his perverted world then raise
From the conflagrant mass purged and refined
New Heavens new Earth ages of endless date
Founded in righteousness and peace and love
To bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss
He ended and thus Adam last replied
How soon hath thy prediction Seer blest
Measured this transient world the race of time
Till time stand fixed  Beyond is all abyss
Eternity whose end no eye can reach
Greatlyinstructed I shall hence depart
Greatly in peace of thought and have my fill
Of knowledge what this vessel can contain
Beyond which was my folly to aspire
Henceforth I learn that to obey is best
And love with fear the only God to walk
As in his presence ever to observe
His providence and on him sole depend
Merciful over all his works with good
Still overcoming evil and by small
Accomplishing great things by things deemed weak
Subverting worldly strong and worldly wise
By simply meek that suffering for truths sake
Is fortitude to highest victory
And to the faithful death the gate of life
Taught this by his example whom I now
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest
To whom thus also the Angel last replied
This having learned thou hast attained the sum
Of wisdom hope no higher though all the stars
Thou knewest by name and all the ethereal powers
All secrets of the deep all Natures works
Or works of God in Heaven air earth or sea
And all the riches of this world enjoyedst
And all the rule one empire only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith
Add virtue patience temperance add love
By name to come called charity the soul
Of all the rest then wilt thou not be loth
To leave this Paradise but shalt possess
A Paradise within thee happier far
Let us descend now therefore from this top
Of speculation for the hour precise
Exacts our parting hence and seethe guards
By me encamped on yonder hill expect
Their motion at whose front a flaming sword
In signal of remove waves fiercely round
We may no longer stay go waken Eve
Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed
Portending good and all her spirits composed
To meek submission thou at season fit
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard
Chiefly what may concern her faith to know
The great deliverance by her seed to come
For by the Womans seed on all mankind
That ye may live which will be many days
Both in one faith unanimous though sad
With cause for evils past yet much more cheered
With meditation on the happy end
He ended and they both descend the hill
Descended Adam to the bower where Eve
Lay sleeping ran before but found her waked
And thus with words not sad she him received
Whence thou returnest and whither wentest I know
For God is also in sleep and dreams advise
Which he hath sent propitious some great good
Presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress
Wearied I fell asleep  But now lead on
In me is no delay with thee to go
Is to stay here without thee here to stay
Is to go hence unwilling thou to me
