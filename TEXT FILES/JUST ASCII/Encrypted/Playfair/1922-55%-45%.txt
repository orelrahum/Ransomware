ROSALIND	O my dear Orlando how it grieves me to see thee
	wear thy heart in a scarf

ORLANDO	It is my arm

ROSALIND	I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
	of a lion

ORLANDO	Wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady

ROSALIND	Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
	swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?

ORLANDO	Ay and greater wonders than that

ROSALIND	O I know where you are nay tis true there was
	never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
	and Caesars thrasonical brag of I came saw and
	overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner
	met but they looked no sooner looked but they
	loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner
	sighed but they asked one another the reason no
	sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy
	and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
	to marriage which they will climb incontinent or
	else be incontinent before marriage they are in
	the very wrath of love and they will together clubs
	cannot part them

ORLANDO	They shall be married tomorrow and I will bid the
	duke to the nuptial But O how bitter a thing it
	is to look into happiness through another mans
	eyes By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at
	the height of heartheaviness by how much I shall
	think my brother happy in having what he wishes for

ROSALIND	Why then tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I can live no longer by thinking

ROSALIND	I will weary you then no longer with idle talking
	Know of me then for now I speak to some purpose
	that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit I
	speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
	of my knowledge insomuch I say I know you are
	neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
	some little measure draw a belief from you to do
	yourself good and not to grace me Believe then if
	you please that I can do strange things I have
	since I was three year old conversed with a
	magician most profound in his art and yet not
	damnable If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
	as your gesture cries it out when your brother
	marries Aliena shall you marry her I know into
	what straits of fortune she is driven and it is
	not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient
	to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
	as she is and without any danger

ORLANDO	Speakest thou in sober meanings?

ROSALIND	By my life I do which I tender dearly though I
	say I am a magician Therefore put you in your
	best array bid your friends for if you will be
	married tomorrow you shall and to Rosalind if you will

	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	How that a life was but a flower
	In spring time c

	And therefore take the present time
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	For love is crowned with the prime
	In spring time c

	Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

DUKE SENIOR	I do remember in this shepherd boy
	Some lively touches of my daughters favour

ORLANDO	My lord the first time that I ever saw him
	Methought he was a brother to your daughter
	But my good lord this boy is forestborn
	And hath been tutord in the rudiments
	Of many desperate studies by his uncle
	Whom he reports to be a great magician
	Obscured in the circle of this forest

	Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

JAQUES	There is sure another flood toward and these
	couples are coming to the ark Here comes a pair of
	very strange beasts which in all tongues are called fools

TOUCHSTONE	Salutation and greeting to you all

JAQUES	Good my lord bid him welcome this is the
	motleyminded gentleman that I have so often met in
	the forest he hath been a courtier he swears

TOUCHSTONE	If any man doubt that let him put me to my
	purgation I have trod a measure I have flattered
	a lady I have been politic with my friend smooth
	with mine enemy I have undone three tailors I have
	had four quarrels and like to have fought one

JAQUES	And how was that taen up?

TOUCHSTONE	Faith we met and found the quarrel was upon the
	seventh cause

JAQUES	How seventh cause? Good my lord like this fellow

DUKE SENIOR	I like him very well

TOUCHSTONE	God ild you sir I desire you of the like I
	press in here sir amongst the rest of the country
	copulatives to swear and to forswear according as
	marriage binds and blood breaks a poor virgin
	sir an illfavoured thing sir but mine own a poor
	humour of mine sir to take that that no man else
	will rich honesty dwells like a miser sir in a
	poor house as your pearl in your foul oyster

DUKE SENIOR	By my faith he is very swift and sententious

TOUCHSTONE	According to the fools bolt sir and such dulcet diseases

JAQUES	But for the seventh cause how did you find the
	quarrel on the seventh cause?

TOUCHSTONE	Upon a lie seven times removedbear your body more
	seeming Audreyas thus sir I did dislike the
	cut of a certain courtiers beard he sent me word
	if I said his beard was not cut well he was in the
	mind it was this is called the Retort Courteous
	If I sent him word again it was not well cut he
	would send me word he cut it to please himself
	this is called the Quip Modest If again it was
	not well cut he disabled my judgment this is
	called the Reply Churlish If again it was not
	well cut he would answer I spake not true this
	is called the Reproof Valiant If again it was not
	well cut he would say I lied this is called the
	Countercheque Quarrelsome and so to the Lie
	Circumstantial and the Lie Direct

JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?

TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial
	nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct and so we
	measured swords and parted

JAQUES	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?

TOUCHSTONE	O sir we quarrel in print by the book as you have
	books for good manners I will name you the degrees
	The first the Retort Courteous the second the
	Quip Modest the third the Reply Churlish the
	fourth the Reproof Valiant the fifth the
	Countercheque Quarrelsome the sixth the Lie with
	Circumstance the seventh the Lie Direct All
	these you may avoid but the Lie Direct and you may
	avoid that too with an If I knew when seven
	justices could not take up a quarrel but when the
	parties were met themselves one of them thought but
	of an If as If you said so then I said so and
	they shook hands and swore brothers Your If is the
	only peacemaker much virtue in If

JAQUES	Is not this a rare fellow my lord? hes as good at
	any thing and yet a fool

	the presentation of that he shoots his wit

	Addressd a mighty power which were on foot
	In his own conduct purposely to take
	His brother here and put him to the sword
	And to the skirts of this wild wood he came
	Where meeting with an old religious man
	After some question with him was converted
	Both from his enterprise and from the world
	His crown bequeathing to his banishd brother
	And all their lands restored to them again
	That were with him exiled This to be true
	I do engage my life

	To one his lands withheld and to the other
	A land itself at large a potent dukedom

	That here were well begun and well begot
	And after every of this happy number
	That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
	Shall share the good of our returned fortune
	According to the measure of their states
	Meantime forget this newfalln dignity
	And fall into our rustic revelry
	Play music And you brides and bridegrooms all
	With measure heapd in joy to the measures fall

JAQUES	Sir by your patience If I heard you rightly
	The duke hath put on a religious life
	And thrown into neglect the pompous court?

JAQUES DE BOYS	He hath

JAQUES	To him will I  out of these convertites
	There is much matter to be heard and learnd

	Ill stay to know at your abandond cave

	Exit
