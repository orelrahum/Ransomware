    economy has adjusted smoothly to the great changes in output and trade
    patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust to the challenges of the s
    particularly to the further economic integration of Western Europe and the
    amazingly rapid changes in East European political and economic prospects

    because monetary policy was tightened to combat inflation and because of the
    weak international economy In the second half of  however Switzerland
    is expected to resume growth despite inflation and unemployment problems

     and the trade deficit will continue to decline after dropping by over
     to  billion due to increased exports to Germany Unemployment
