  Curiouser and curiouser cried Alice she was so much
surprised that for the moment she quite forgot how to speak good
English now Im opening out like the largest telescope that
ever was  Goodbye feet for when she looked down at her
feet they seemed to be almost out of sight they were getting so
far off  Oh my poor little feet I wonder who will put on
your shoes and stockings for you now dears?  Im sure I shant
be able  I shall be a great deal too far off to trouble myself
about you  you must manage the best way you can but I must be
kind to them thought Alice or perhaps they wont walk the
way I want to go  Let me see  Ill give them a new pair of
boots every Christmas

  And she went on planning to herself how she would manage it
They must go by the carrier she thought and how funny itll
seem sending presents to ones own feet  And how odd the
directions will look

            ALICES RIGHT FOOT ESQ
                HEARTHRUG
                    NEAR THE FENDER
                        WITH ALICES LOVE

Oh dear what nonsense Im talking

  Just then her head struck against the roof of the hall  in
fact she was now more than nine feet high and she at once took
up the little golden key and hurried off to the garden door

  Poor Alice  It was as much as she could do lying down on one
side to look through into the garden with one eye but to get
through was more hopeless than ever  she sat down and began to
cry again

  You ought to be ashamed of yourself said Alice a great
girl like you she might well say this to go on crying in
this way  Stop this moment I tell you  But she went on all
the same shedding gallons of tears until there was a large pool
all round her about four inches deep and reaching half down the
hall

  After a time she heard a little pattering of feet in the
distance and she hastily dried her eyes to see what was coming
It was the White Rabbit returning splendidly dressed with a
pair of white kid gloves in one hand and a large fan in the
other  he came trotting along in a great hurry muttering to
himself as he came Oh the Duchess the Duchess Oh wont she
be savage if Ive kept her waiting  Alice felt so desperate
that she was ready to ask help of any one so when the Rabbit
came near her she began in a low timid voice If you please
sir  The Rabbit started violently dropped the white kid
gloves and the fan and skurried away into the darkness as hard
as he could go

  Alice took up the fan and gloves and as the hall was very
hot she kept fanning herself all the time she went on talking
Dear dear  How queer everything is today  And yesterday
things went on just as usual  I wonder if Ive been changed in
the night?  Let me think  was I the same when I got up this
morning?  I almost think I can remember feeling a little
different  But if Im not the same the next question is Who in
the world am I?  Ah THATS the great puzzle  And she began
thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
as herself to see if she could have been changed for any of
them

  Im sure Im not Ada she said for her hair goes in such
long ringlets and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and Im
sure I cant be Mabel for I know all sorts of things and she
oh she knows such a very little  Besides SHES she and Im I
andoh dear how puzzling it all is  Ill try if I know all the
things I used to know  Let me see  four times five is twelve
and four times six is thirteen and four times seven isoh dear
I shall never get to twenty at that rate  However the
Multiplication Table doesnt signify  lets try Geography
London is the capital of Paris and Paris is the capital of Rome
and Romeno THATS all wrong Im certain  I must have been
changed for Mabel  Ill try and say "How doth the little"
and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons
and began to repeat it but her voice sounded hoarse and
strange and the words did not come the same as they used to do

            How doth the little crocodile
              Improve his shining tail
            And pour the waters of the Nile
              On every golden scale

            How cheerfully he seems to grin
              How neatly spread his claws
            And welcome little fishes in
              With gently smiling jaws

  Im sure those are not the right words said poor Alice and
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on I must be Mabel
after all and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
house and have next to no toys to play with and oh ever so
many lessons to learn  No Ive made up my mind about it if Im
Mabel Ill stay down here  Itll be no use their putting their
heads down and saying "Come up again dear"  I shall only look
up and say "Who am I then?  Tell me that first and then if I
like being that person Ill come up  if not Ill stay down
here till Im somebody else"but oh dear cried Alice with a
sudden burst of tears I do wish they WOULD put their heads
down  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here

  As she said this she looked down at her hands and was
surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbits little
white kid gloves while she was talking  How CAN I have done
that? she thought  I must be growing small again  She got up
and went to the table to measure herself by it and found that
as nearly as she could guess she was now about two feet high
and was going on shrinking rapidly  she soon found out that the
cause of this was the fan she was holding and she dropped it
hastily just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether

That WAS a narrow escape said Alice a good deal frightened at
the sudden change but very glad to find herself still in
existence and now for the garden and she ran with all speed
back to the little door  but alas the little door was shut
again and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
before and things are worse than ever thought the poor child
for I never was so small as this before never  And I declare
its too bad that it is

  As she said these words her foot slipped and in another
moment splash she was up to her chin in salt water  He first
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea and in that
case I can go back by railway she said to herself  Alice had
been to the seaside once in her life and had come to the general
conclusion that wherever you go to on the English coast you find
a number of bathing machines in the sea some children digging in
the sand with wooden spades then a row of lodging houses and
behind them a railway station  However she soon made out that
she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine
feet high

  I wish I hadnt cried so much said Alice as she swam about
trying to find her way out  I shall be punished for it now I
suppose by being drowned in my own tears  That WILL be a queer
thing to be sure  However everything is queer today

  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a
little way off and she swam nearer to make out what it was  at
first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus but then
she remembered how small she was now and she soon made out that
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself

  Would it be of any use now thought Alice to speak to this
mouse?  Everything is so outoftheway down here that I should
think very likely it can talk  at any rate theres no harm in
trying  So she began  O Mouse do you know the way out of
this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here O Mouse
Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse
she had never done such a thing before but she remembered having
seen in her brothers Latin Grammar A mouseof a mouseto a
mousea mouseO mouse  The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
eyes but it said nothing

  Perhaps it doesnt understand English thought Alice I
daresay its a French mouse come over with William the
Conqueror  For with all her knowledge of history Alice had
no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened  So she
began again  Ou est ma chatte? which was the first sentence in
her French lessonbook  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the
water and seemed to quiver all over with fright  Oh I beg
your pardon cried Alice hastily afraid that she had hurt the
poor animals feelings  I quite forgot you didnt like cats

  Not like cats cried the Mouse in a shrill passionate
voice  Would YOU like cats if you were me?

  Well perhaps not said Alice in a soothing tone  dont be
angry about it  And yet I wish I could show you our cat Dinah
I think youd take a fancy to cats if you could only see her
She is such a dear quiet thing Alice went on half to herself
as she swam lazily about in the pool and she sits purring so
nicely by the fire licking her paws and washing her faceand
she is such a nice soft thing to nurseand shes such a capital
one for catching miceoh I beg your pardon cried Alice again
for this time the Mouse was bristling all over and she felt
certain it must be really offended  We wont talk about her any
more if youd rather not

  We indeed cried the Mouse who was trembling down to the end
of his tail  As if I would talk on such a subject  Our family
always HATED cats  nasty low vulgar things  Dont let me hear
the name again

  I wont indeed said Alice in a great hurry to change the
subject of conversation  Are youare you fondofof dogs?
The Mouse did not answer so Alice went on eagerly  There is
such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you
A little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly
brown hair  And itll fetch things when you throw them and
itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsI
cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer you
know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds
He says it kills all the rats andoh dear cried Alice in a
sorrowful tone Im afraid Ive offended it again  For the
Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go and
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went

  So she called softly after it Mouse dear  Do come back
again and we wont talk about cats or dogs either if you dont
like them  When the Mouse heard this it turned round and swam
slowly back to her  its face was quite pale with passion Alice
thought and it said in a low trembling voice Let us get to
the shore and then Ill tell you my history and youll
understand why it is I hate cats and dogs

  It was high time to go for the pool was getting quite crowded
with the birds and animals that had fallen into it  there were a
Duck and a Dodo a Lory and an Eaglet and several other curious
creatures  Alice led the way and the whole party swam to the
shore



                           CHAPTER III

                  A CaucusRace and a Long Tale


  They were indeed a queerlooking party that assembled on the
bankthe birds with draggled feathers the animals with their
fur clinging close to them and all dripping wet cross and
uncomfortable

  The first question of course was how to get dry again  they
had a consultation about this and after a few minutes it seemed
quite natural to Alice to find herself talking familiarly with
them as if she had known them all her life  Indeed she had
quite a long argument with the Lory who at last turned sulky
and would only say I am older than you and must know better
and this Alice would not allow without knowing how old it was
and as the Lory positively refused to tell its age there was no
more to be said

  At last the Mouse who seemed to be a person of authority among
them called out Sit down all of you and listen to me  ILL
soon make you dry enough  They all sat down at once in a large
ring with the Mouse in the middle  Alice kept her eyes
anxiously fixed on it for she felt sure she would catch a bad
cold if she did not get dry very soon

  Ahem said the Mouse with an important air are you all ready?
This is the driest thing I know  Silence all round if you please
"William the Conqueror whose cause was favoured by the pope was
soon submitted to by the English who wanted leaders and had been
of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest  Edwin and
Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria"

  Ugh said the Lory with a shiver

  I beg your pardon said the Mouse frowning but very
politely  Did you speak?

  Not I said the Lory hastily

  I thought you did said the Mouse  I proceed  "Edwin and
Morcar the earls of Mercia and Northumbria declared for him
and even Stigand the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury found
it advisable"

  Found WHAT? said the Duck

  Found IT the Mouse replied rather crossly  of course you
know what "it" means

  I know what "it" means well enough when I find a thing said
the Duck  its generally a frog or a worm  The question is
what did the archbishop find?

  The Mouse did not notice this question but hurriedly went on
"found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William
and offer him the crown  Williams conduct at first was
moderate  But the insolence of his Normans"  How are you
getting on now my dear? it continued turning to Alice as it
spoke

  As wet as ever said Alice in a melancholy tone  it doesnt
seem to dry me at all

  In that case said the Dodo solemnly rising to its feet I
move that the meeting adjourn for the immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies

  Speak English said the Eaglet  I dont know the meaning of
half those long words and whats more I dont believe you do
either  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile
some of the other birds tittered audibly

  What I was going to say said the Dodo in an offended tone
was that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucusrace

  What IS a Caucusrace? said Alice not that she wanted much
to know but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
ought to speak and no one else seemed inclined to say anything

  Why said the Dodo the best way to explain it is to do it
And as you might like to try the thing yourself some winter
day I will tell you how the Dodo managed it

  First it marked out a racecourse in a sort of circle the
exact shape doesnt matter it said and then all the party
were placed along the course here and there  There was no One
two three and away but they began running when they liked
and left off when they liked so that it was not easy to know
when the race was over  However when they had been running half
an hour or so and were quite dry again the Dodo suddenly called
out The race is over and they all crowded round it panting
and asking But who has won?

  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare
in the pictures of him while the rest waited in silence  At
last the Dodo said EVERYBODY has won and all must have
prizes

  But who is to give the prizes? quite a chorus of voices
asked

  Why SHE of course said the Dodo pointing to Alice with
one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her
calling out in a confused way Prizes Prizes

  Alice had no idea what to do and in despair she put her hand
in her pocket and pulled out a box of comfits luckily the salt
water had not got into it and handed them round as prizes
There was exactly one apiece all round

  But she must have a prize herself you know said the Mouse

  Of course the Dodo replied very gravely  What else have
you got in your pocket? he went on turning to Alice

  Only a thimble said Alice sadly

  Hand it over here said the Dodo

  Then they all crowded round her once more while the Dodo
solemnly presented the thimble saying We beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble and when it had finished this short
speech they all cheered

  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd but they all looked
so grave that she did not dare to laugh and as she could not
think of anything to say she simply bowed and took the thimble
looking as solemn as she could

  The next thing was to eat the comfits  this caused some noise
and confusion as the large birds complained that they could not
taste theirs and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
the back  However it was over at last and they sat down again
in a ring and begged the Mouse to tell them something more

  You promised to tell me your history you know said Alice
and why it is you hateC and D she added in a whisper half
afraid that it would be offended again

  Mine is a long and a sad tale said the Mouse turning to
Alice and sighing

  It IS a long tail certainly said Alice looking down with
wonder at the Mouses tail but wOK WW XIO NQXV MG LEN?  KWR
