Couched and now filled with pasture gazing sat
Or bedward ruminating for the sun
Declined was hasting now with prone career
To the ocean isles and in the ascending scale
Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose
When Satan still in gaze as first he stood
Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad
O Hell what do mine eyes with grief behold
Into our room of bliss thus high advanced
Creatures of other mould earthborn perhaps
Not Spirits yet to heavenly Spirits bright
Little inferiour whom my thoughts pursue
With wonder and could love so lively shines
In them divine resemblance and such grace
The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured
Ah gentle pair ye little think how nigh
Your change approaches when all these delights
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe
More woe the more your taste is now of joy
Happy but for so happy ill secured
Long to continue and this high seat your Heaven
Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe
As now is entered yet no purposed foe
To you whom I could pity thus forlorn
Though I unpitied  League with you I seek
And mutual amity so strait so close
That I with you must dwell or you with me
Henceforth my dwelling haply may not please
Like this fair Paradise your sense yet such
Accept your Makers work he gave it me
Which I as freely give  Hell shall unfold
To entertain you two her widest gates
And send forth all her kings there will be room
Not like these narrow limits to receive
Your numerous offspring if no better place
Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge
On you who wrong me not for him who wronged
And should I at your harmless innocence
Melt as I do yet publick reason just
Honour and empire with revenge enlarged
By conquering this new world compels me now
To do what else though damned I should abhor
So spake the Fiend and with necessity
The tyrants plea excused his devilish deeds
Then from his lofty stand on that high tree
Down he alights among the sportful herd
Of those fourfooted kinds himself now one
Now other as their shape served best his end
Nearer to view his prey and unespied
To mark what of their state he more might learn
By word or action marked About them round
A lion now he stalks with fiery glare
Then as a tiger who by chance hath spied
In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play
Straight couches close then rising changes oft
His couchant watch as one who chose his ground
Whence rushing he might surest seize them both
Griped in each paw when Adam first of men
To first of women Eve thus moving speech
Turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow
Sole partner and sole part of all these joys
Dearer thyself than all needs must the Power
That made us and for us this ample world
Be infinitely good and of his good
As liberal and free as infinite
That raised us from the dust and placed us here
In all this happiness who at his hand
Have nothing merited nor can perform
Aught whereof he hath need he who requires
From us no other service than to keep
This one this easy charge of all the trees
In Paradise that bear delicious fruit
So various not to taste that only tree
Of knowledge planted by the tree of life
So near grows death to life whateer death is
Some dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowest
God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree
The only sign of our obedience left
Among so many signs of power and rule
Conferred upon us and dominion given
Over all other creatures that possess
Earth air and sea  Then let us not think hard
One easy prohibition who enjoy
Free leave so large to all things else and choice
Unlimited of manifold delights
But let us ever praise him and extol
His bounty following our delightful task
To prune these growing plants and tend these flowers
Which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet
To whom thus Eve replied  O thou for whom
And from whom I was formed flesh of thy flesh
And without whom am to no end my guide
And head what thou hast said is just and right
For we to him indeed all praises owe
And daily thanks I chiefly who enjoy
So far the happier lot enjoying thee
Preeminent by so much odds while thou
Like consort to thyself canst no where find
That day I oft remember when from sleep
I first awaked and found myself reposed
Under a shade on flowers much wondering where
And what I was whence thither brought and how
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
Of waters issued from a cave and spread
Into a liquid plain then stood unmoved
Pure as the expanse of Heaven I thither went
With unexperienced thought and laid me down
On the green bank to look into the clear
Smooth lake that to me seemed another sky
As I bent down to look just opposite
A shape within the watery gleam appeared
Bending to look on me  I started back
It started back but pleased I soon returned
Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
Of sympathy and love  There I had fixed
Mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire
Had not a voice thus warned me  What thou seest
What there thou seest fair Creature is thyself
With thee it came and goes but follow me
And I will bring thee where no shadow stays
Thy coming and thy soft embraces he
Whose image thou art him thou shalt enjoy
Inseparably thine to him shalt bear
Multitudes like thyself and thence be called
Mother of human race  What could I do
But follow straight invisibly thus led?
Till I espied thee fair indeed and tall
Under a platane yet methought less fair
Less winning soft less amiably mild
Than that smooth watery image  Back I turned
Thou following cryedst aloud Return fair Eve
Whom flyest thou?  whom thou flyest of him thou art
His flesh his bone to give thee being I lent
Out of my side to thee nearest my heart
Substantial life to have thee by my side
Henceforth an individual solace dear
Part of my soul I seek thee and thee claim
My other half  With that thy gentle hand
Seised mine  I yieldedand from that time see
How beauty is excelled by manly grace
And wisdom which alone is truly fair
So spake our general mother and with eyes
Of conjugal attraction unreproved
And meek surrender halfembracing leaned
On our first father half her swelling breast
Naked met his under the flowing gold
Of her loose tresses hid he in delight
Both of her beauty and submissive charms
Smiled with superiour love as Jupiter
On Juno smiles when he impregns the clouds
That shed Mayflowers and pressed her matron lip
With kisses pure  Aside the Devil turned
For envy yet with jealous leer malign
Eyed them askance and to himself thus plained
Sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two
Imparadised in one anothers arms
The happier Eden shall enjoy their fill
Of bliss on bliss while I to Hell am thrust
Where neither joy nor love but fierce desire
Among our other torments not the least
Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines
Yet let me not forget what I have gained
From their own mouths  All is not theirs it seems
One fatal tree there stands of knowledge called
Forbidden them to taste  Knowledge forbidden
Suspicious reasonless  Why should their Lord
Envy them that?  Can it be sin to know?
Can it be death?  And do they only stand
By ignorance?  Is that their happy state
The proof of their obedience and their faith?
O fair foundation laid whereon to build
Their ruin hence I will excite their minds
With more desire to know and to reject
Envious commands invented with design
To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
Equal with Gods aspiring to be such
They taste and die  What likelier can ensue
But first with narrow search I must walk round
This garden and no corner leave unspied
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side
Or in thick shade retired from him to draw
What further would be learned  Live while ye may
Yet happy pair enjoy till I return
Short pleasures for long woes are to succeed
So saying his proud step he scornful turned
But with sly circumspection and began
Through wood through waste oer hill oer dale his roam
Mean while in utmost longitude where Heaven
With earth and ocean meets the setting sun
Slowly descended and with right aspect
Against the eastern gate of Paradise
Levelled his evening rays  It was a rock
Of alabaster piled up to the clouds
Conspicuous far winding with one ascent
Accessible from earth one entrance high
The rest was craggy cliff that overhung
Still as it rose impossible to climb
Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat
Chief of the angelick guards awaiting night
About him exercised heroick games
The unarmed youth of Heaven but nigh at hand
Celestial armoury shields helms and spears
Hung high with diamond flaming and with gold
Thither came Uriel gliding through the even
On a sunbeam swift as a shooting star
In autumn thwarts the night when vapours fired
Impress the air and shows the mariner
From what point of his compass to beware
Impetuous winds  He thus began in haste
Gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given
Charge and strict watch that to this happy place
No evil thing approach or enter in
This day at highth of noon came to my sphere
A Spirit zealous as he seemed to know
More of the Almightys works and chiefly Man
Gods latest image  I described his way
Bent all on speed and marked his aery gait
But in the mount that lies from Eden north
Where he first lighted soon discerned his looks
Alien from Heaven with passions foul obscured
Mine eye pursued him still but under shade
Lost sight of him  One of the banished crew
I fear hath ventured from the deep to raise
New troubles him thy care must be to find
To whom the winged warriour thus returned
Uriel no wonder if thy perfect sight
Amid the suns bright circle where thou sitst
See far and wide  In at this gate none pass
The vigilance here placed but such as come
Well known from Heaven and since meridian hour
No creature thence  If Spirit of other sort
So minded have oerleaped these earthly bounds
On purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude
Spiritual substance with corporeal bar
But if within the circuit of these walks
In whatsoever shape he lurk of whom
Thou tellest by morrow dawning I shall know
So promised he and Uriel to his charge
Returned on that bright beam whose point now raised
Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
Beneath the Azores whether the prime orb
Incredible how swift had thither rolled
Diurnal or this less volubil earth
By shorter flight to the east had left him there
Arraying with reflected purple and gold
The clouds that on his western throne attend
Now came still Evening on and Twilight gray
Had in her sober livery all things clad
Silence accompanied for beast and bird
