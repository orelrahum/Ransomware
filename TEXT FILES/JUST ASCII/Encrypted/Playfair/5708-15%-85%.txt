Bulgaria Economy

Overview
    Growth in the lackluster Bulgarian economy fell to the  annual level in
    the s By  Sofias foreign debt had skyrocketed to over  billion
     giving a debtservice ratio of more than  of hard currency earnings and
    leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments
    The postCommunist government faces major problems of renovating an aging
    industrial plant coping with worsening energy food and consumer goods
    shortages keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments
    investing in additional energy capacity the portion of electric power from
    nuclear energy reached over onethird in  and motivating workers in
    part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises Bulgarias
    new government led by Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov is strongly committed
    to economic reform The previous government even though dominated by former
    Communists had taken the first steps toward dismantling the central
    planning system bringing the economy back into balance and reducing
    inflationary pressures The program produced some encouraging early results
    including eased restrictions on foreign investment increased support from
    international financial institutions and liberalized currency trading
    Small entrepreneurs have begun to emerge and some privatization of small
    enterprises has taken place The government has passed bills to privatize
    large stateowned enterprises and reform the banking system Negotiations on

Burma Economy

Overview
    Burma is a poor Asian country with a per capita GDP of about  The
    nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export
    earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity exports
    For rice traditionally the most important export the drop in world prices
    has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales In
     teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this
    position The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector which
    generates about  of GDP and provides employment for  of the work
    force Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces
    and has been trying to encourage foreign investment so far with little
    success

Burundi Economy

Overview
    A landlocked resourcepoor country in an early stage of economic
    development Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
    industries Its economic health depends on the coffee crop which accounts
    for an average  of foreign exchange earnings each year The ability to
    pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
    climate and the international coffee market As part of its economic reform
    agenda launched in February  with IMF and World Bank support Burundi
    is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability and attract foreign
    investment in industry Several stateowned coffee companies were privatized
    via public auction in September
