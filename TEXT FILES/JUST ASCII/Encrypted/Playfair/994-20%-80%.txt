Our lingering parents and to the eastern gate
Led them direct and down the cliff as fast
To the subjected plain then disappeared
They looking back all the eastern side beheld
Of Paradise so late their happy seat
Waved over by that flaming brand the gate
With dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms
Some natural tears they dropt but wiped them soon
The world was all before them where to choose
Their place of rest and Providence their guide
They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow
Through Eden took their solitary way

Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about one million dollars for each hour we work  One
hundred hours is a conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce a
million dollars per hour next year we will have to do four text
files per month thus upping our productivity to two millionhr
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December     x Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers
