Her office holds of all external things
Which the five watchful senses represent
She forms imaginations aery shapes
Which Reason joining or disjoining frames
All what we affirm or what deny and call
Our knowledge or opinion then retires
Into her private cell when nature rests
Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes
To imitate her but misjoining shapes
Wild work produces oft and most in dreams
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late
Some such resemblances methinks I find
Of our last evenings talk in this thy dream
But with addition strange yet be not sad
Evil into the mind of God or Man
May come and go so unreproved and leave
No spot or blame behind  Which gives me hope
That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream
Waking thou never will consent to do
Be not disheartened then nor cloud those looks
That wont to be more cheerful and serene
Than when fair morning first smiles on the world
And let us to our fresh employments rise
Among the groves the fountains and the flowers
That open now their choisest bosomed smells
Reserved from night and kept for thee in store
So cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered
But silently a gentle tear let fall
From either eye and wiped them with her hair
Two other precious drops that ready stood
Each in their crystal sluice he ere they fell
Kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
And pious awe that feared to have offended
So all was cleared and to the field they haste
But first from under shady arborous roof
Soon as they forth were come to open sight
Of dayspring and the sun who scarce uprisen
With wheels yet hovering oer the oceanbrim
Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray
Discovering in wide landskip all the east
Of Paradise and Edens happy plains
Lowly they bowed adoring and began
Their orisons each morning duly paid
In various style for neither various style
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
Their Maker in fit strains pronounced or sung
Unmeditated such prompt eloquence
Flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse
More tuneable than needed lute or harp
To add more sweetness and they thus began
These are thy glorious works Parent of good
Almighty  Thine this universal frame
Thus wonderous fair  Thyself how wonderous then
Unspeakable who sitst above these heavens
To us invisible or dimly seen
In these thy lowest works yet these declare
Thy goodness beyond thought and power divine
Speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light
Angels for ye behold him and with songs
And choral symphonies day without night
Circle his throne rejoicing ye in Heaven
On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol
Him first him last him midst and without end
Fairest of stars last in the train of night
If better thou belong not to the dawn
Sure pledge of day that crownest the smiling morn
With thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere
While day arises that sweet hour of prime
Thou Sun of this great world both eye and soul
Acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise
In thy eternal course both when thou climbest
And when high noon hast gained and when thou fallest
Moon that now meetest the orient sun now flyest
With the fixed Stars fixed in their orb that flies
And ye five other wandering Fires that move
In mystick dance not without song resound
His praise who out of darkness called up light
Air and ye Elements the eldest birth
Of Natures womb that in quaternion run
Perpetual circle multiform and mix
And nourish all things let your ceaseless change
Vary to our great Maker still new praise
Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise
From hill or steaming lake dusky or gray
Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold
In honour to the worlds great Author rise
Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers
Rising or falling still advance his praise
His praise ye Winds that from four quarters blow
Breathe soft or loud and wave your tops ye Pines
With every plant in sign of worship wave
Fountains and ye that warble as ye flow
Melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise
Join voices all ye living Souls  Ye Birds
That singing up to Heavengate ascend
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praise
Ye that in waters glide and ye that walk
The earth and stately tread or lowly creep
Witness if I be silent morn or even
To hill or valley fountain or fresh shade
Made vocal by my song and taught his praise
Hail universal Lord be bounteous still
To give us only good and if the night
Have gathered aught of evil or concealed
Disperse it as now light dispels the dark
So prayed they innocent and to their thoughts
Firm peace recovered soon and wonted calm
On to their mornings rural work they haste
Among sweet dews and flowers where any row
Of fruittrees overwoody reached too far
Their pampered boughs and needed hands to check
Fruitless embraces or they led the vine
To wed her elm she spoused about him twines
Her marriageable arms and with him brings
Her dower the adopted clusters to adorn
His barren leaves  Them thus employed beheld
With pity Heavens high King and to him called
Raphael the sociable Spirit that deigned
To travel with Tobias and secured
His marriage with the seventimeswedded maid
Raphael said he thou hearest what stir on Earth
Satan from Hell scaped through the darksome gulf
Hath raised in Paradise and how disturbed
This night the human pair how he designs
In them at once to ruin all mankind
Go therefore half this day as friend with friend
Converse with Adam in what bower or shade
Thou findest him from the heat of noon retired
To respite his daylabour with repast
Or with repose and such discourse bring on
As may advise him of his happy state
Happiness in his power left free to will
Left to his own free will his will though free
Yet mutable whence warn him to beware
He swerve not too secure  Tell him withal
His danger and from whom what enemy
Late fallen himself from Heaven is plotting now
The fall of others from like state of bliss
By violence? no for that shall be withstood
But by deceit and lies  This let him know
Lest wilfully transgressing he pretend
Surprisal unadmonished unforewarned
So spake the Eternal Father and fulfilled
All justice  Nor delayed the winged Saint
After his charge received but from among
Thousand celestial Ardours where he stood
Veiled with his gorgeous wings up springing light
Flew through the midst of Heaven the angelick quires
On each hand parting to his speed gave way
Through all the empyreal road till at the gate
Of Heaven arrived the gate selfopened wide
On golden hinges turning as by work
Divine the sovran Architect had framed
From hence no cloud or to obstruct his sight
Star interposed however small he sees
Not unconformed to other shining globes
Earth and the garden of God with cedars crowned
Above all hills  As when by night the glass
Of Galileo less assured observes
Imagined lands and regions in the moon
Or pilot from amidst the Cyclades
Delos or Samos first appearing kens
A cloudy spot  Down thither prone in flight
He speeds and through the vast ethereal sky
Sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing
Now on the polar winds then with quick fan
Winnows the buxom air till within soar
Of towering eagles to all the fowls he seems
A phoenix gazed by all as that sole bird
When to enshrine his reliques in the Suns
Bright temple to Egyptian Thebes he flies
At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise
He lights and to his proper shape returns
A Seraph winged  Six wings he wore to shade
His lineaments divine the pair that clad
Each shoulder broad came mantling oer his breast
With regal ornament the middle pair
Girt like a starry zone his waist and round
Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold
And colours dipt in Heaven the third his feet
Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail
Skytinctured grain  Like Maias son he stood
And shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled
The circuit wide  Straight knew him all the bands
Of Angels under watch and to his state
And to his message high in honour rise
For on some message high they guessed him bound
Their glittering tents he passed and now is come
Into the blissful field through groves of myrrh
And flowering odours cassia nard and balm
A wilderness of sweets for Nature here
Wantoned as in her prime and played at will
Her virgin fancies pouring forth more sweet
Wild above rule or art enormous bliss
Him through the spicy forest onward come
Adam discerned as in the door he sat
Of his cool bower while now the mounted sun
Shot down direct his fervid rays to warm
Earths inmost womb more warmth than Adam needs
And Eve within due at her hour prepared
For dinner savoury fruits of taste to please
True appetite and not disrelish thirst
Of nectarous draughts between from milky stream
Berry or grape  To whom thus Adam called
Haste hither Eve and worth thy sight behold
Eastward among those trees what glorious shape
Comes this way moving seems another morn
Risen on midnoon some great behest from Heaven
To us perhaps he brings and will vouchsafe
This day to be our guest  But go with speed
And what thy stores contain bring forth and pour
Abundance fit to honour and receive
Our heavenly stranger  Well we may afford
Our givers their own gifts and large bestow
From large bestowed where Nature multiplies
Her fertile growth and by disburthening grows
More fruitful which instructs us not to spare
To whom thus Eve  Adam earths hallowed mould
Of God inspired small store will serve where store
All seasons ripe for use hangs on the stalk
Save what by frugal storing firmness gains
To nourish and superfluous moist consumes
But I will haste and from each bough and brake
Each plant and juciest gourd will pluck such choice
To entertain our Angelguest as he
Beholding shall confess that here on Earth
God hath dispensed his bounties as in Heaven
So saying with dispatchful looks in haste
She turns on hospitable thoughts intent
What choice to choose for delicacy best
What order so contrived as not to mix
Tastes not well joined inelegant but bring
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change
Bestirs her then and from each tender stalk
Whatever Earth allbearing mother yields
In India East or West or middle shore
In Pontus or the Punick coast or where
Alcinous reigned fruit of all kinds in coat
Rough or smooth rind or bearded husk or shell
She gathers tribute large and on the board
Heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape
She crushes inoffensive must and meaths
From many a berry and from sweet kernels pressed
She tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold
Wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground
With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed
Mean while our primitive great sire to meet
His Godlike guest walks forth without more train
Accompanied than with his own complete
Perfections in himself was all his state
More solemn than the tedious pomp that waits
On princes when their rich retinue long
Of horses led and grooms besmeared with gold
Dazzles the croud and sets them all agape
Nearer his presence Adam though not awed
Yet with submiss approach and reverence meek
As to a superiour nature bowing low
Thus said  Native of Heaven for other place
None can than Heaven such glorious shape contain
Since by descending from the thrones above
Those happy places thou hast deigned a while
To want and honour these vouchsafe with us
Two only who yet by sovran gift possess
This spacious ground in yonder shady bower
To rest and what the garden choicest bears
To sit and taste till this meridian heat
Be over and the sun more cool decline
Whom thus the angelick Virtue answered mild
Adam I therefore came nor art thou such
Created or such place hast here to dwell
As may not oft invite though Spirits of Heaven
To visit thee lead on then where thy bower
Oershades for these midhours till evening rise
I have at will  So to the sylvan lodge
They came that like Pomonas arbour smiled
With flowerets decked and fragrant smells but Eve
Undecked save with herself more lovely fair
Than WoodNymph or the fairest Goddess feigned
Of three that in mount Ida naked strove
Stood to entertain her guest from Heaven no veil
She needed virtueproof no thought infirm
Altered her cheek  On whom the Angel Hail
Bestowed the holy salutation used
Long after to blest Mary second Eve
Hail Mother of Mankind whose fruitful womb
Shall fill the world more numerous with thy sons
Than with these various fruits the trees of God
Have heaped this tableRaised of grassy turf
Their table was and mossy seats had round
And on her ample square from side to side
All autumn piled though spring and autumn here
Danced hand in hand  A while discourse they hold
No fear lest dinner cool when thus began
Our author  Heavenly stranger please to taste
These bounties which our Nourisher from whom
All perfect good unmeasured out descends
To us for food and for delight hath caused
The earth to yield unsavoury food perhaps
To spiritual natures only this I know
That one celestial Father gives to all
To whom the Angel  Therefore what he gives
Whose praise be ever sung to Man in part
Spiritual may of purest Spirits be found
No ingrateful food  And food alike those pure
Intelligential substances require
As doth your rational and both contain
Within them every lower faculty
Of sense whereby they hear see smell touch taste
Tasting concoct digest assimilate
And corporeal to incorporeal turn
For know whatever was created needs
To be sustained and fed  Of elements
The grosser feeds the purer earth the sea
Earth and the sea feed air the air those fires
Ethereal and as lowest first the moon
Whence in her visage round those spots unpurged
Vapours not yet into her substance turned
Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale
From her moist continent to higher orbs
The sun that light imparts to all receives
From all his alimental recompence
In humid exhalations and at even
Sups with the ocean  Though in Heaven the trees
Of life ambrosial fruitage bear and vines
Yield nectar though from off the boughs each morn
We brush mellifluous dews and find the ground
Covered with pearly grain  Yet God hath here
Varied his bounty so with new delights
As may compare with Heaven and to taste
Think not I shall be nice  So down they sat
And to their viands fell nor seemingly
The Angel nor in mist the common gloss
Of Theologians but with keen dispatch
Of real hunger and concoctive heat
To transubstantiate  What redounds transpires
Through Spirits with ease nor wonderif by fire
Of sooty coal the empirick alchemist
Can turn or holds it possible to turn
Metals of drossiest ore to perfect gold
As from the mine  Mean while at table Eve
Ministered naked and their flowing cups
With pleasant liquours crowned  O innocence
Deserving Paradise if ever then
Then had the sons of God excuse to have been
Enamoured at that sight but in those hearts
Love unlibidinous reigned nor jealousy
Was understood the injured lovers hell
Thus when with meats and drinks they had sufficed
Not burdened nature sudden mind arose
In Adam not to let the occasion pass
Given him by this great conference to know
Of things above his world and of their being
Who dwell in Heaven whose excellence RS PYN
