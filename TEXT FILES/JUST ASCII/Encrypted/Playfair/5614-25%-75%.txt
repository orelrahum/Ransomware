Morocco Economy

Overview
    The economy had recovered moderately in  because of the resolution of a
    trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales a rebound in textile
    sales to the EC lower prices for food imports a sharp increase in worker
    remittances increased Arab donor aid and generous debt rescheduling
    agreements Economic performance in  was mixed A record harvest helped
    real GDP advance by  although nonagricultural output grew by less than
     Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial policies triggered
    rapid credit and monetary growth Despite recovery of domestic demand
    import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely affected by
    phosphate marketing difficulties In January  Morocco reached a new
    month standby arrangement for  million with the IMF In February
     the Paris Club rescheduled  billion of Moroccos commercial debt
    This is thought to be Moroccos last rescheduling By  the Moroccan
    authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service obligations
    without additional rescheduling Servicing this large debt high
    unemployment and Moroccos vulnerability to external economic forces remain
    severe longterm problems
