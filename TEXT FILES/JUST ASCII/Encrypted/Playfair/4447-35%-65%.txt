Opprobrious with his robe of righteousness
Arraying covered from his Fathers sight
To him with swift ascent he up returned
Into his blissful bosom reassumed
In glory as of old to him appeased
All though allknowing what had passed with Man
Recounted mixing intercession sweet
Mean while ere thus was sinned and judged on Earth
Within the gates of Hell sat Sin and Death
In counterview within the gates that now
Stood open wide belching outrageous flame
Far into Chaos since the Fiend passed through
Sin opening who thus now to Death began
O Son why sit we here each other viewing
Idly while Satan our great author thrives
In other worlds and happier seat provides
For us his offspring dear?  It cannot be
But that success attends him if mishap
Ere this he had returned with fury driven
By his avengers since no place like this
Can fit his punishment or their revenge
Methinks I feel new strength within me rise
Wings growing and dominion given me large
Beyond this deep whatever draws me on
Or sympathy or some connatural force
Powerful at greatest distance to unite
With secret amity things of like kind
By secretest conveyance  Thou my shade
Inseparable must with me along
For Death from Sin no power can separate
But lest the difficulty of passing back
Stay his return perhaps over this gulf
Impassable impervious let us try
Adventurous work yet to thy power and mine
Not unagreeable to found a path
Over this main from Hell to that new world
Where Satan now prevails a monument
Of merit high to all the infernal host
Easing their passage hence for intercourse
Or transmigration as their lot shall lead
Nor can I miss the way so strongly drawn
By this newfelt attraction and instinct
Whom thus the meager Shadow answered soon
Go whither Fate and inclination strong
Leads thee I shall not lag behind nor err
The way thou leading such a scent I draw
Of carnage prey innumerable and taste
The savour of death from all things there that live
Nor shall I to the work thou enterprisest
Be wanting but afford thee equal aid
So saying with delight he snuffed the smell
Of mortal change on earth  As when a flock
Of ravenous fowl though many a league remote
Against the day of battle to a field
Where armies lie encamped come flying lured
With scent of living carcasses designed
For death the following day in bloody fight
So scented the grim Feature and upturned
His nostril wide into the murky air
Sagacious of his quarry from so far
Then both from out Hellgates into the waste
Wide anarchy of Chaos damp and dark
Flew diverse and with power their power was great
Hovering upon the waters what they met
Solid or slimy as in raging sea
Tost up and down together crouded drove
From each side shoaling towards the mouth of Hell
As when two polar winds blowing adverse
Upon the Cronian sea together drive
Mountains of ice that stop the imagined way
Beyond Petsora eastward to the rich
Cathaian coast  The aggregated soil
Death with his mace petrifick cold and dry
As with a trident smote and fixed as firm
As Delos floating once the rest his look
Bound with Gorgonian rigour not to move
And with Asphaltick slime broad as the gate
Deep to the roots of Hell the gathered beach
They fastened and the mole immense wrought on
Over the foaming deep higharched a bridge
Of length prodigious joining to the wall
Immoveable of this now fenceless world
Forfeit to Death from hence a passage broad
Smooth easy inoffensive down to Hell
So if great things to small may be compared
Xerxes the liberty of Greece to yoke
From Susa his Memnonian palace high
Came to the sea and over Hellespont
Bridging his way Europe with Asia joined
And scourged with many a stroke the indignant waves
Now had they brought the work by wonderous art
Pontifical a ridge of pendant rock
Over the vexed abyss following the track
Of Satan to the selfsame place where he
First lighted from his wing and landed safe
From out of Chaos to the outside bare
Of this round world  With pins of adamant
And chains they made all fast too fast they made
And durable  And now in little space
The confines met of empyrean Heaven
And of this World and on the left hand Hell
With long reach interposed three several ways
In sight to each of these three places led
And now their way to Earth they had descried
To Paradise first tending when behold
Satan in likeness of an Angel bright
Betwixt the Centaur and the Scorpion steering
His zenith while the sun in Aries rose
Disguised he came but those his children dear
Their parent soon discerned though in disguise
He after Eve seduced unminded slunk
Into the wood fast by and changing shape
To observe the sequel saw his guileful act
By Eve though all unweeting seconded
Upon her husband saw their shame that sought
Vain covertures but when he saw descend
The Son of God to judge them terrified
He fled not hoping to escape but shun
The present fearing guilty what his wrath
Might suddenly inflict that past returned
By night and listening where the hapless pair
Sat in their sad discourse and various plaint
Thence gathered his own doom which understood
Not instant but of future time with joy
And tidings fraught to Hell he now returned
And at the brink of Chaos near the foot
Of this new wonderous pontifice unhoped
Met who to meet him came his offspring dear
Great joy was at their meeting and at sight
Of that stupendious bridge his joy encreased
Long he admiring stood till Sin his fair
Enchanting daughter thus the silence broke
O Parent these are thy magnifick deeds
Thy trophies which thou viewest as not thine own
Thou art their author and prime architect
For I no sooner in my heart divined
My heart which by a secret harmony
Still moves with thine joined in connexion sweet
That thou on earth hadst prospered which thy looks
Now also evidence but straight I felt
Though distant from thee worlds between yet felt
That I must after thee with this thy son
Such fatal consequence unites us three
Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds
Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure
Detain from following thy illustrious track
Thou hast achieved our liberty confined
Within Hellgates till now thou us impowered
To fortify thus far and overlay
With this portentous bridge the dark abyss
Thine now is all this world thy virtue hath won
What thy hands builded not thy wisdom gained
With odds what war hath lost and fully avenged
Our foil in Heaven here thou shalt monarch reign
There didst not there let him still victor sway
As battle hath adjudged from this new world
Retiring by his own doom alienated
And henceforth monarchy with thee divide
Of all things parted by the empyreal bounds
His quadrature from thy orbicular world
Or try thee now more dangerous to his throne
Whom thus the Prince of darkness answered glad
Fair Daughter and thou Son and Grandchild both
High proof ye now have given to be the race
Of Satan for I glory in the name
Antagonist of Heavens Almighty King
Amply have merited of me of all
The infernal empire that so near Heavens door
Triumphal with triumphal act have met
Mine with this glorious work and made one realm
Hell and this world one realm one continent
Of easy thoroughfare  Therefore while I
Descend through darkness on your road with ease
To my associate Powers them to acquaint
With these successes and with them rejoice
