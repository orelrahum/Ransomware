began

  Youre a very poor speaker said the King

  Here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately
suppressed by the officers of the court  As that is rather a
hard word I will just explain to you how it was done  They had
a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings
into this they slipped the guineapig head first and then sat
upon it

  Im glad Ive seen that done thought Alice  Ive so often
read in the newspapers at the end of trials "There was some
attempts at applause which was immediately suppressed by the
officers of the court" and I never understood what it meant
till now

  If thats all you know about it you may stand down
continued the King

  I cant go no lower said the Hatter  Im on the floor as
it is

  Then you may SIT down the King replied

  Here the other guineapig cheered and was suppressed

  Come that finished the guineapigs thought Alice  Now we
shall get on better

  Id rather finish my tea said the Hatter with an anxious
look at the Queen who was reading the list of singers

  You may go said the King and the Hatter hurriedly left the
court without even waiting to put his shoes on

  and just take his head off outside the Queen added to one
of the officers  but the Hatter was out of sight before the
officer could get to the door

  Call the next witness said the King

  The next witness was the Duchesss cook  She carried the
pepperbox in her hand and Alice guessed who it was even before
she got into the court by the way the people near the door began
sneezing all at once

  Give your evidence said the King

  Shant said the cook

  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit who said in a
low voice Your Majesty must crossexamine THIS witness

  Well if I must I must the King said with a melancholy
air and after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till
his eyes were nearly out of sight he said in a deep voice What
are tarts made of?

  Pepper mostly said the cook

  Treacle said a sleepy voice behind her

  Collar that Dormouse the Queen shrieked out  Behead that
Dormouse  Turn that Dormouse out of court  Suppress him  Pinch
him  Off with his whiskers

  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion getting the
Dormouse turned out and by the time they had settled down
again the cook had disappeared

  Never mind said the King with an air of great relief
Call the next witness  And he added in an undertone to the
Queen Really my dear YOU must crossexamine the next witness
It quite makes my forehead ache

  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like
for they havent got much evidence YET she said to herself
Imagine her surprise when the White Rabbit read out at the top
of his shrill little voice the name Alice



                           CHAPTER XII

                        Alices Evidence


  Here cried Alice quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with
the edge of her skirt upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below and there they lay sprawling about reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
the week before

  Oh I BEG your pardon she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay and began picking them up again as quickly as she could
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head and
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
and put back into the jurybox or they would die

  The trial cannot proceed said the King in a very grave
voice until all the jurymen are back in their proper places
ALL he repeated with great emphasis looking hard at Alice as
he said do

  Alice looked at the jurybox and saw that in her haste she
had put the Lizard in head downwards and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way being quite unable
to move  She soon got it out again and put it right not that
it signifies much she said to herself I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other

  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
being upset and their slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them they set to work very diligently to write
out a history of the accident all except the Lizard who seemed
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open
gazing up into the roof of the court

  What do you know about this business? the King said to
Alice

  Nothing said Alice

  Nothing WHATEVER? persisted the King

  Nothing whatever said Alice

  Thats very important the King said turning to the jury
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates when
the White Rabbit interrupted  UNimportant your Majesty means
of course he said in a very respectful tone but frowning and
making faces at him as he spoke

  UNimportant of course I meant the King hastily said and
went on to himself in an undertone importantunimportant
unimportantimportant as if he were trying which word
sounded best

  Some of the jury wrote it down important and some
unimportant  Alice could see this as she was near enough to
look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit she
thought to herself

  At this moment the King who had been for some time busily
writing in his notebook cackled out Silence and read out
from his book Rule Fortytwo  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT

  Everybody looked at Alice

  IM not a mile high said Alice

  You are said the King

  Nearly two miles high added the Queen

  Well I shant go at any rate said Alice  besides
thats not a regular rule  you invented it just now

  Its the oldest rule in the book said the King

  Then it ought to be Number One said Alice

  The King turned pale and shut his notebook hastily
Consider your verdict he said to the jury in a low trembling
voice

  Theres more evidence to come yet please your Majesty said
the White Rabbit jumping up in a great hurry this paper has
just been picked up

  Whats in it? said the Queen

  I havent opened it yet said the White Rabbit but it seems
to be a letter written by the prisoner toto somebody

  It must have been that said the King unless it was
written to nobody which isnt usual you know

  Who is it directed to? said one of the jurymen

  It isnt directed at all said the White Rabbit in fact
theres nothing written on the OUTSIDE  He unfolded the paper
as he spoke and added It isnt a letter after all  its a set
of verses

  Are they in the prisoners handwriting? asked another of
they jurymen

  No theyre not said the White Rabbit and thats the
queerest thing about it  The jury all looked puzzled

  He must have imitated somebody elses hand said the King
The jury all brightened up again

  Please your Majesty said the Knave I didnt write it and
they cant prove I did  theres no name signed at the end

  If you didnt sign it said the King that only makes the
matter worse  You MUST have meant some mischief or else youd
have signed your name like an honest man

  There was a general clapping of hands at this  it was the
first really clever thing the King had said that day

  That PROVES his guilt said the Queen

  It proves nothing of the sort said Alice  Why you dont
even know what theyre about

  Read them said the King

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles  Where shall I begin
please your Majesty? he asked

  Begin at the beginning the King said gravely and go on
till you come to the end  then stop

  These were the verses the White Rabbit read

        They told me you had been to her
          And mentioned me to him
        She gave me a good character
          But said I could not swim

        He sent them word I had not gone
          We know it to be true
        If she should push the matter on
          What would become of you?

        I gave her one they gave him two
          You gave us three or more
        They all returned from him to you
          Though they were mine before

        If I or she should chance to be
          Involved in this affair
        He trusts to you to set them free
          Exactly as we were

        My notion was that you had been
          Before she had this fit
        An obstacle that came between
          Him and ourselves and it

        Dont let him know she liked them best
          For this must ever be
        A secret kept from all the rest
          Between yourself and me

  Thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet
said the King rubbing his hands so now let the jury

  If any one of them can explain it said Alice she had
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit
afraid of interrupting him Ill give him sixpence  I dont
believe theres an atom of meaning in it

  The jury all wrote down on their slates SHE doesnt believe
theres an atom of meaning in it but none of them attempted to
explain the paper

  If theres no meaning in it said the King that saves a
world of trouble you know as we neednt try to find any  And
yet I dont know he went on spreading out the verses on his
knee and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some
meaning in them after all  "SAID I COULD NOT SWIM" you
cant swim can you? he added turning to the Knave

  The Knave shook his head sadly  Do I look like it? he said
Which he certainly did NOT being made entirely of cardboard

  All right so far said the King and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself  "WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE" thats
the jury of course "I GAVE HER ONE THEY GAVE HIM TWO" why
that must be what he did with the tarts you know

  But it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU" said
Alice

  Why there they are said the King PCHOHTUECFXA ZHUDGMDF ZM
