Attentive and with more delighted ear
Divine instructer I have heard than when
Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills
Aereal musick send  Nor knew I not
To be both will and deed created free
Yet that we never shall forget to love
Our Maker and obey him whose command
Single is yet so just my constant thoughts
Assured me and still assure  Though what thou tellest
Hath passed in Heaven some doubt within me move
But more desire to hear if thou consent
The full relation which must needs be strange
Worthy of sacred silence to be heard
And we have yet large day for scarce the sun
Hath finished half his journey and scarce begins
His other half in the great zone of Heaven
Thus Adam made request and Raphael
After short pause assenting thus began
High matter thou enjoinest me O prime of men
Sad task and hard  For how shall I relate
To human sense the invisible exploits
Of warring Spirits? how without remorse
The ruin of so many glorious once
And perfect while they stood? how last unfold
The secrets of another world perhaps
Not lawful to reveal? yet for thy good
This is dispensed and what surmounts the reach
Of human sense I shall delineate so
By likening spiritual to corporal forms
As may express them best though what if Earth
Be but a shadow of Heaven and things therein
Each to other like more than on earth is thought?
As yet this world was not and Chaos wild
Reigned where these Heavens now roll where Earth now rests
Upon her center poised when on a day
For time though in eternity applied
To motion measures all things durable
By present past and future on such day
As Heavens great year brings forth the empyreal host
Of Angels by imperial summons called
Innumerable before the Almightys throne
Forthwith from all the ends of Heaven appeared
Under their Hierarchs in orders bright
Ten thousand thousand ensigns high advanced
Standards and gonfalons twixt van and rear
Stream in the air and for distinction serve
Of hierarchies of orders and degrees
Or in their glittering tissues bear imblazed
Holy memorials acts of zeal and love
Recorded eminent  Thus when in orbs
Of circuit inexpressible they stood
Orb within orb the Father Infinite
By whom in bliss imbosomed sat the Son
Amidst as from a flaming mount whose top
Brightness had made invisible thus spake
Hear all ye Angels progeny of light
Thrones Dominations Princedoms Virtues Powers
Hear my decree which unrevoked shall stand
This day I have begot whom I declare
My only Son and on this holy hill
Him have anointed whom ye now behold
At my right hand your head I him appoint
And by myself have sworn to him shall bow
All knees in Heaven and shall confess him Lord
Under his great vicegerent reign abide
United as one individual soul
For ever happy  Him who disobeys
Me disobeys breaks union and that day
Cast out from God and blessed vision falls
Into utter darkness deep ingulfed his place
Ordained without redemption without end
So spake the Omnipotent and with his words
All seemed well pleased all seemed but were not all
That day as other solemn days they spent
In song and dance about the sacred hill
Mystical dance which yonder starry sphere
Of planets and of fixed in all her wheels
Resembles nearest mazes intricate
Eccentrick intervolved yet regular
Then most when most irregular they seem
And in their motions harmony divine
So smooths her charming tones that Gods own ear
Listens delighted  Evening now approached
For we have also our evening and our morn
We ours for change delectable not need
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
Desirous all in circles as they stood
Tables are set and on a sudden piled
With Angels food and rubied nectar flows
In pearl in diamond and massy gold
Fruit of delicious vines the growth of Heaven
On flowers reposed and with fresh flowerets crowned
They eat they drink and in communion sweet
Quaff immortality and joy secure
Of surfeit where full measure only bounds
Excess before the allbounteous King who showered
