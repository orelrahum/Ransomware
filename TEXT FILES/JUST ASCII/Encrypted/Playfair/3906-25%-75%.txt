Native perfumes and whisper whence they stole
Those balmy spoils  As when to them who fail
Beyond the Cape of Hope and now are past
Mozambick off at sea northeast winds blow
Sabean odours from the spicy shore
Of Araby the blest with such delay
Well pleased they slack their course and many a league
Cheered with the grateful smell old Ocean smiles
So entertained those odorous sweets the Fiend
Who came their bane though with them better pleased
Than Asmodeus with the fishy fume
That drove him though enamoured from the spouse
Of Tobits son and with a vengeance sent
From Media post to Egypt there fast bound
Now to the ascent of that steep savage hill
Satan had journeyed on pensive and slow
But further way found none so thick entwined
As one continued brake the undergrowth
Of shrubs and tangling bushes had perplexed
All path of man or beast that passed that way
One gate there only was and that looked east
On the other side which when the archfelon saw
Due entrance he disdained and in contempt
At one flight bound high overleaped all bound
Of hill or highest wall and sheer within
Lights on his feet  As when a prowling wolf
Whom hunger drives to seek new haunt for prey
Watching where shepherds pen their flocks at eve
In hurdled cotes amid the field secure
Leaps oer the fence with ease into the fold
Or as a thief bent to unhoard the cash
Of some rich burgher whose substantial doors
Crossbarred and bolted fast fear no assault
In at the window climbs or oer the tiles
So clomb this first grand thief into Gods fold
So since into his church lewd hirelings climb
Thence up he flew and on the tree of life
The middle tree and highest there that grew
Sat like a cormorant yet not true life
Thereby regained but sat devising death
To them who lived nor on the virtue thought
Of that lifegiving plant but only used
For prospect what well used had been the pledge
Of immortality  So little knows
Any but God alone to value right
The good before him but perverts best things
To worst abuse or to their meanest use
Beneath him with new wonder now he views
To all delight of human sense exposed
In narrow room Natures whole wealth yea more
A Heaven on Earth  For blissful Paradise
Of God the garden was by him in the east
Of Eden planted Eden stretched her line
From Auran eastward to the royal towers
Of great Seleucia built by Grecian kings
Of where the sons of Eden long before
Dwelt in Telassar  In this pleasant soil
His far more pleasant garden God ordained
Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
All trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste
And all amid them stood the tree of life
High eminent blooming ambrosial fruit
Of vegetable gold and next to life
Our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by
Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill
Southward through Eden went a river large
Nor changed his course but through the shaggy hill
Passed underneath ingulfed for God had thrown
That mountain as his gardenmould high raised
Upon the rapid current which through veins
Of porous earth with kindly thirst updrawn
Rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill
Watered the garden thence united fell
Down the steep glade and met the nether flood
Which from his darksome passage now appears
And now divided into four main streams
Runs diverse wandering many a famous realm
And country whereof here needs no account
But rather to tell how if Art could tell
How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks
Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold
With mazy errour under pendant shades
Ran nectar visiting each plant and fed
Flowers worthy of Paradise which not nice Art
In beds and curious knots but Nature boon
Poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain
Both where the morning sun first warmly smote
The open field and where the unpierced shade
Imbrowned the noontide bowers  Thus was this place
A happy rural seat of various view
Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm
Others whose fruit burnished with golden rind
Hung amiable Hesperian fables true
If true here only and of delicious taste
Betwixt them lawns or level downs and flocks
Grazing the tender herb were interposed
Or palmy hillock or the flowery lap
Of some irriguous valley spread her store
Flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose
Another side umbrageous grots and caves
Of cool recess oer which the mantling vine
Lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps
Luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall
Down the slope hills dispersed or in a lake
That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
Her crystal mirrour holds unite their streams
The birds their quire apply airs vernal airs
Breathing the smell of field and grove attune
The trembling leaves while universal Pan
Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance
Led on the eternal Spring  Not that fair field
Of Enna where Proserpine gathering flowers
Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis
Was gathered which cost Ceres all that pain
To seek her through the world nor that sweet grove
Of Daphne by Orontes and the inspired
Castalian spring might with this Paradise
Of Eden strive nor that Nyseian isle
Girt with the river Triton where old Cham
Whom Gentiles Ammon call and Libyan Jove
Hid Amalthea and her florid son
Young Bacchus from his stepdame Rheas eye
Nor where Abassin kings their issue guard
Mount Amara though this by some supposed
True Paradise under the Ethiop line
By Nilus head enclosed with shining rock
A whole days journey high but wide remote
From this Assyrian garden where the Fiend
Saw undelighted all delight all kind
Of living creatures new to sight and strange
Two of far nobler shape erect and tall
Godlike erect with native honour clad
In naked majesty seemed lords of all
And worthy seemed for in their looks divine
The image of their glorious Maker shone
Truth wisdom sanctitude severe and pure
Severe but in true filial freedom placed
Whence true authority in men though both
Not equal as their sex not equal seemed
For contemplation he and valour formed
For softness she and sweet attractive grace
He for God only she for God in him
His fair large front and eye sublime declared
Absolute rule and hyacinthine locks
Round from his parted forelock manly hung
Clustering but not beneath his shoulders broad
She as a veil down to the slender waist
Her unadorned golden tresses wore
Dishevelled but in wanton ringlets waved
As the vine curls her tendrils which implied
Subjection but required with gentle sway
And by her yielded by him best received
Yielded with coy submission modest pride
And sweet reluctant amorous delay
Nor those mysterious parts were then concealed
Then was not guilty shame dishonest shame
Of natures works honour dishonourable
Sinbred how have ye troubled all mankind
With shows instead mere shows of seeming pure
And banished from mans life his happiest life
Simplicity and spotless innocence
So passed they naked on nor shunned the sight
Of God or Angel for they thought no ill
So hand in hand they passed the loveliest pair
That ever since in loves embraces met
Adam the goodliest man of men since born
His sons the fairest of her daughters Eve
Under a tuft of shade that on a green
Stood whispering soft by a fresh fountain side
They sat them down and after no more toil
Of their sweet gardening labour than sufficed
To recommend cool Zephyr and made ease
More easy wholesome thirst and appetite
More grateful to their supperfruits they fell
Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
Yielded them sidelong as they sat recline
On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers
The savoury pulp they chew and in the rind
Still as they thirsted scoop the brimming stream
Nor gentle purpose nor endearing smiles
Wanted nor youthful dalliance as beseems
Fair couple linked in happy nuptial league
Alone as they  About them frisking played
All beasts of the earth since wild and of all chase
In wood or wilderness forest or den
Sporting the lion ramped and in his paw
Dandled the kid bears tigers ounces pards
Gambolled before them the unwieldy elephant
To make them mirth used all his might and wreathed
His?kithetmroboscis close the serpent sly
Insinuating wove with Gordian twine
His braided train and of his fatal guile
Gave proof unheeded others on the grass
Couched and now filled with pasture gazing sat
Or bedward ruminating for the sun
Declined was hasting now with prone career
To the ocean isles and in the ascending scale
Of Heaven the stars that usher evening rose
When Satan still in gaze as first he stood
Scarce thus at length failed speech recovered sad
O Hell what do mine eyes with grief behold
Into our room of bliss thus high advanced
Creatures of other mould earthborn perhaps
Not Spirits yet to heavenly Spirits bright
Little inferiour whom my thoughts pursue
With wonder and could love so lively shines
In them divine resemblance and such grace
The hand that formed them on their shape hath poured
Ah gentle pair ye little think how nigh
Your change approaches when all these delights
Will vanish and deliver ye to woe
More woe the more your taste is now of joy
Happy but for so happy ill secured
Long to continue and this high seat your Heaven
Ill fenced for Heaven to keep out such a foe
As now is entered yet no purposed foe
To you whom I could pity thus forlorn
Though I unpitied  League with you I seek
And mutual amity so strait so close
That I with you must dwell or you with me
Henceforth my dwelling haply may not please
Like this fair Paradise your sense yet such
Accept your Makers work he gave it me
Which I as freely give  Hell shall unfold
To entertain you two her widest gates
And send forth all her kings there will be room
Not like these narrow limits to receive
Your numerous offspring if no better place
Thank him who puts me loth to this revenge
On you who wrong me not for him who wronged
And should I at your harmless innocence
Melt as I do yet publick reason just
Honour and empire with revenge enlarged
By conquering this new world compels me now
To do what else though damned I should abhor
So spake the Fiend and with necessity
The tyrants plea excused his devilish deeds
Then from his lofty stand on that high tree
Down he alights among the sportful herd
Of those fourfooted kinds himself now one
Now other as their shape served best his end
Nearer to view his prey and unespied
To mark what of their state he more might learn
By word or action marked About them round
A lion now he stalks with fiery glare
Then as a tiger who by chance hath spied
In some purlieu two gentle fawns at play
Straight couches close then rising changes oft
His couchant watch as one who chose his ground
Whence rushing he might surest seize them both
Griped in each paw when Adam first of men
To first of women Eve thus moving speech
Turned him all ear to hear new utterance flow
Sole partner and sole part of all these joys
Dearer thyself than all needs must the Power
That made us and for us this ample world
Be infinitely good and of his good
As liberal and free as infinite
That raised us from the dust and placed us here
In all this happiness who at his hand
Have nothing merited nor can perform
Aught whereof he hath need he who requires
From us no other service than to keep
This one this easy charge of all the trees
In Paradise that bear delicious fruit
So various not to taste that only tree
Of knowledge planted by the tree of life
So near grows death to life whateer death is
Some dreadful thing no doubt for well thou knowest
God hath pronounced it death to taste that tree
The only sign of our obedience left
Among so many signs of power and rule
Conferred upon us and dominion given
Over all other creatures that possess
Earth air and sea  Then let us not think hard
One easy prohibition who enjoy
Free leave so large to all things else and choice
Unlimited of manifold delights
But let us ever praise him and extol
His bounty following our delightful task
To prune these growing plants and tend these flowers
Which were it toilsome yet with thee were sweet
To whom thus Eve replied  O thou for whom
And from whom I was formed flesh of thy flesh
And without whom am to no end my guide
And head what thou hast said is just and right
For we to him indeed all praises owe
And daily thanks I chiefly who enjoy
So far the happier lot enjoying thee
Preeminent by so much odds while thou
Like consort to thyself canst no where find
That day I oft remember when from sleep
I first awaked and found myself reposed
Under a shade on flowers much wondering where
And what I was whence thither brought and how
Not distant far from thence a murmuring sound
Of waters issued from a cave and spread
Into a liquid plain then stood unmoved
Pure as the expanse of Heaven I thither went
With unexperienced thought and laid me down
On the green bank to look into the clear
Smooth lake that to me seemed another sky
As I bent down to look just opposite
A shape within the watery gleam appeared
Bending to look on me  I started back
It started back but pleased I soon returned
Pleased it returned as soon with answering looks
Of sympathy and love  There I had fixed
Mine eyes till now and pined with vain desire
Had not a voice thus warned me  What thou seest
What there thou seest fair Creature is thyself
With thee it came and goes but follow me
And I will bring thee where no shadow stays
Thy coming and thy soft embraces he
Whose image thou art him thou shalt enjoy
Inseparably thine to him shalt bear
Multitudes like thyself and thence be called
Mother of human race  What could I do
But follow straight invisibly thus led?
Till I espied thee fair indeed and tall
Under a platane yet methought less fair
Less winning soft less amiably mild
Than that smooth watery image  Back I turned
Thou following cryedst aloud Return fair Eve
Whom flyest thou?  whom thou flyest of him thou art
His flesh his bone to give thee being I lent
Out of my side to thee nearest my heart
Substantial life to have thee by my side
Henceforth an individual solace dear
Part of my soul I seek thee and thee claim
My other half  With that thy gentle hand
Seised mine  I yieldedand from that time see
How beauty is excelled by manly grace
And wisdom which alone is truly fair
So spake our general mother and with eyes
Of conjugal attraction unreproved
And meek surrender halfembracing leaned
On our first father half her swelling breast
Naked met his under the flowing gold
Of her loose tresses hid he in delight
Both of her beauty and submissive charms
Smiled with superiour love as Jupiter
On Juno smiles when he impregns the clouds
That shed Mayflowers and pressed her matron lip
With kisses pure  Aside the Devil turned
For envy yet with jealous leer malign
Eyed them askance and to himself thus plained
Sight hateful sight tormenting thus these two
Imparadised in one anothers arms
The happier Eden shall enjoy their fill
Of bliss on bliss while I to Hell am thrust
Where neither joy nor love but fierce desire
Among our other torments not the least
Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines
Yet let me not forget what I have gained
From their own mouths  All is not theirs it seems
One fatal tree there stands of knowledge called
Forbidden them to taste  Knowledge forbidden
Suspicious reasonless  Why should their Lord
Envy them that?  Can it be sin to know?
Can it be death?  And do they only stand
By ignorance?  Is that their happy state
The proof of their obedience and their faith?
O fair foundation laid whereon to build
Their ruin hence I will excite their minds
With more desire to know and to reject
Envious commands invented with design
To keep them low whom knowledge might exalt
Equal with Gods aspiring to be such
They taste and die  What likelier can ensue
But first with narrow search I must walk round
This garden and no corner leave unspied
A chance but chance may lead where I may meet
Some wandering Spirit of Heaven by fountain side
Or in thick shade retired from him to draw
What further would be learned  Live while ye may
Yet happy pair enjoy till I return
Short pleasures for long woes are to succeed
So saying his proud step he scornful turned
But with sly circumspection and began
Through wood through waste oer hill oer dale his roam
Mean while in utmost longitude where Heaven
With earth and ocean meets the setting sun
Slowly descended and with right aspect
Against the eastern gate of Paradise
Levelled his evening rays  It was a rock
Of alabaster piled up to the clouds
Conspicuous far winding with one ascent
Accessible from earth one entrance high
The rest was craggy cliff that overhung
Still as it rose impossible to climb
Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat
Chief of the angelick guards awaiting night
About him exercised heroick games
The unarmed youth of Heaven but nigh at hand
Celestial armoury shields helms and spears
Hung high with diamond flaming and with gold
Thither came Uriel gliding through the even
On a sunbeam swift as a shooting star
In autumn thwarts the night when vapours fired
Impress the air and shows the mariner
From what point of his compass to beware
Impetuous winds  He thus began in haste
Gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given
Charge and strict watch that to this happy place
No evil thing approach or enter in
This day at highth of noon came to my sphere
A Spirit zealous as he seemed to know
More of the Almightys works and chiefly Man
Gods latest image  I described his way
Bent all on speed and marked his aery gait
But in the mount that lies from Eden north
Where he first lighted soon discerned his looks
Alien from Heaven with passions foul obscured
Mine eye pursued him still but under shade
Lost sight of him  One of the banished crew
I fear hath ventured from the deep to raise
New troubles him thy care must be to find
To whom the winged warriour thus returned
Uriel no wonder if thy perfect sight
Amid the suns bright circle where thou sitst
See far and wide  In at this gate none pass
The vigilance here placed but such as come
Well known from Heaven and since meridian hour
No creature thence  If Spirit of other sort
So minded have oerleaped these earthly bounds
On purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude
Spiritual substance with corporeal bar
But if within the circuit of these walks
In whatsoever shape he lurk of whom
Thou tellest by morrow dawning I shall know
So promised he and Uriel to his charge
Returned on that bright beam whose point now raised
Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
Beneath the Azores whether the prime orb
Incredible how swift had thither rolled
Diurnal or this less volubil earth
By shorter flight to the east had left him there
Arraying with reflected purple and gold
The clouds that on his western throne attend
Now came still Evening on and Twilight gray
Had in her sober livery all things clad
Silence accompanied for beast and bird
They to their grassy couch these to their nests
Were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale
She all night long her amorous descant sung
Silence was pleased  Now glowed the firmament
With living sapphires  Hesperus that led
The starry host rode brightest till the moon
Rising in clouded majesty at length
Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light
And oer the dark her silver mantle threw
When Adam thus to Eve  Fair Consort the hour
Of night and all things now retired to rest
Mind us of like repose since God hath set
Labour and rest as day and night to men
Successive and the timely dew of sleep
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
Our eyelids  Other creatures all day long
Rove idle unemployed and less need rest
Man hath his daily work of body or mind
Appointed which declares his dignity
And the regard of Heaven on all his ways
While other animals unactive range
And of their doings God takes no account
Tomorrow ere fresh morning streak the east
With first approach of light we must be risen
And at our pleasant labour to reform
Yon flowery arbours yonder alleys green
Our walk at noon with branches overgrown
That mock our scant manuring and require
More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth
Those blossoms also and those dropping gums
That lie bestrown unsightly and unsmooth
Ask riddance if we mean to tread with ease
Mean while as Nature wills night bids us rest
To whom thus Eve with perfect beauty adorned
My Author and Disposer what thou bidst
Unargued I obey  So God ordains
God is thy law thou mine  To know no more
Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise
With thee conversing I forget all time
All seasons and their change all please alike
Sweet is the breath of Morn her rising sweet
With charm of earliest birds  pleasant the sun
When first on this delightful land he spreads
His orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower
Glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth
After soft showers and sweet the coming on
Of grateful Evening mild then silent Night
With this her solemn bird and this fair moon
And these the gems of Heaven her starry train
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends
With charm of earliest birds nor rising sun
On this delightful land nor herb fruit flower
Glistering with dew nor fragrance after showers
Nor grateful Evening mild nor silent Night
With this her solemn bird nor walk by moon
Or glittering starlight without thee is sweet
But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom
This glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes?
To whom our general ancestor replied
Daughter of God and Man accomplished Eve
These have their course to finish round the earth
By morrow evening and from land to land
In order though to nations yet unborn
Ministring light prepared they set and rise
Lest total Darkness should by night regain
Her old possession and extinguish life
In Nature and all things which these soft fires
Not only enlighten but with kindly heat
Of various influence foment and warm
Temper or nourish or in part shed down
Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
On earth made hereby apter to receive
Perfection from the suns more potent ray
These then though unbeheld in deep of night
Shine not in vain nor think though men were none
That Heaven would want spectators God want praise
Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
Unseen both when we wake and when we sleep
All these with ceaseless praise his works behold
Both day and night  How often from the steep
Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
Celestial voices to the midnight air
Sole or responsive each to others note
Singing their great Creator? oft in bands
While they keep watch or nightly rounding walk
With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds
In full harmonick number joined their songs
Divide the night and lift our thoughts to Heaven
Thus talking hand in hand alone they passed
On to their blissful bower it was a place
Chosen by the sovran Planter when he framed
All things to Mans delightful use the roof
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
Laurel and myrtle and what higher grew
Of firm and fragrant leaf on either side
Acanthus and each odorous bushy shrub
Fenced up the verdant wall each beauteous flower
Iris all hues roses and jessamin
Reared high their flourished heads between and wrought
Mosaick underfoot the violet
Crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay
Broidered the ground more coloured than with stone
Of costliest emblem  Other creature here
Bird beast insect or worm durst enter none
Such was their awe of Man  In shadier bower
More sacred and sequestered though but feigned
Pan or Sylvanus never slept nor Nymph
Nor Faunus haunted  Here in close recess
With flowers garlands and sweetsmelling herbs
Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed
And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung
What day the genial Angel to our sire
Brought her in naked beauty more adorned
More lovely than Pandora whom the Gods
Endowed with all their gifts and O too like
In sad event when to the unwiser son
Of Japhet brought by Hermes she ensnared
Mankind with her fair looks to be avenged
On him who had stole Joves authentick fire
Thus at their shady lodge arrived both stood
Both turned and under open sky adored
The God that made both sky air earth and heaven
Which they beheld the moons resplendent globe
And starry pole  Thou also madest the night
Maker Omnipotent and thou the day
Which we in our appointed work employed
Have finished happy in our mutual help
And mutual love the crown of all our bliss
Ordained by thee and this delicious place
For us too large where thy abundance wants
Partakers and uncropt falls to the ground
But thou hast promised from us two a race
To fill the earth who shall with us extol
Thy goodness infinite both when we wake
And when we seek as now thy gift of sleep
This said unanimous and other rites
Observing none but adoration pure
Which God likes best into their inmost bower
Handed they went and eased the putting off
These troublesome disguises which we wear
Straight side by side were laid nor turned I ween
Adam from his fair spouse nor Eve the rites
Mysterious of connubial love refused
Whatever hypocrites austerely talk
Of purity and place and innocence
Defaming as impure what God declares
Pure and commands to some leaves free to all
Our Maker bids encrease who bids abstain
But our Destroyer foe to God and Man?
Hail wedded Love mysterious law true source
Of human offspring sole propriety
In Paradise of all things common else
By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men
Among the bestial herds to range by thee
Founded in reason loyal just and pure
Relations dear and all the charities
Of father son and brother first were known
Far be it that I should write thee sin or blame
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place
Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets
Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced
Present or past as saints and patriarchs used
Here Love his golden shafts employs here lights
His constant lamp and waves his purple wings
Reigns here and revels not in the bought smile
Of harlots loveless joyless unendeared
Casual fruition nor in courtamours
Mixed dance or wanton mask or midnight ball
Or serenate which the starved lover sings
To his proud fair best quitted with disdain
These lulled by nightingales embracing slept
And on their naked limbs the flowery roof
Showered roses which the morn repaired  Sleep on
Blest pair and Oyet happiest if ye seek
No happier state and know to know no more
Now had night measured with her shadowy cone
Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault
And from their ivory port the Cherubim
Forth issuing at the accustomed hour stood armed
To their night watches in warlike parade
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake
Uzziel half these draw off and coast the south
With strictest watch these other wheel the north
Our circuit meets full west  As flame they part
Half wheeling to the shield half to the spear
From these two strong and subtle Spirits he called
That near him stood and gave them thus in charge
Ithuriel and Zephon with winged speed
Search through this garden leave unsearched no nook
But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harm
This evening from the suns decline arrived
Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen
Hitherward bent who could have thought? escaped
The bars of Hell on errand bad no doubt
Such where ye find seise fast and hither bring
So saying on he led his radiant files
Dazzling the moon these to the bower direct
