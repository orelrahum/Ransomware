subject of conversation  Are youare you fondofof dogs?
The Mouse did not answer so Alice went on eagerly  There is
such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you
A little brighteyed terrier you know with oh such long curly
brown hair  And itll fetch things when you throw them and
itll sit up and beg for its dinner and all sorts of thingsI
cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer you
know and he says its so useful its worth a hundred pounds

them as if she had known them all her life  Indeed she had
quite a long argument with the Lory who at last turned sulky
and would only say I am older than you and must know better
