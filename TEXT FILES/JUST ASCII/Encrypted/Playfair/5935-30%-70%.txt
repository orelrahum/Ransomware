Thats quite enoughI hope I shant grow any moreAs it is I
cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt drunk quite so
much

  Alas it was too late to wish that  She went on growing and
growing and very soon had to kneel down on the floor  in
another minute there was not even room for this and she tried
the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door and the
other arm curled round her head  Still she went on growing and
as a last resource she put one arm out of the window and one
foot up the chimney and said to herself Now I can do no more
whatever happens  What WILL become of me?

  Luckily for Alice the little magic bottle had now had its full
effect and she grew no larger  still it was very uncomfortable
and as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting
out of the room again no wonder she felt unhappy

  It was much pleasanter at home thought poor Alice when one
wasnt always growing larger and smaller and being ordered about
by mice and rabbits  I almost wish I hadnt gone down that
rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious you know
this sort of life  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me
When I used to read fairytales I fancied that kind of thing
never happened and now here I am in the middle of one  There
ought to be a book written about me that there ought  And when
I grow up Ill write onebut Im grown up now she added in a
sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more
HERE

  But then thought Alice shall I NEVER get any older than I
am now?  Thatll be a comfort one waynever to be an old woman
but thenalways to have lessons to learn  Oh I shouldnt like
THAT

  Oh you foolish Alice she answered herself  How can you
learn lessons in here?  Why theres hardly room for YOU and no
room at all for any lessonbooks

  And so she went on taking first one side and then the other
and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few
minutes she heard a voice outside and stopped to listen

  Mary Ann  Mary Ann said the voice  Fetch me my gloves
this moment  Then came a little pattering of feet on the
stairs  Alice knew it was the Rabbit coming to look for her and
she trembled till she shook the house quite forgetting that she
was now about a thousand times as large as the Rabbit and had no
reason to be afraid of it

  Presently the Rabbit came up to the door and tried to open it
but as the door opened inwards and Alices elbow was pressed
hard against it that attempt proved a failure  Alice heard it
say to itself Then Ill go round and get in at the window

  THAT you wont thought Alice and after waiting till she
fancied she heard the Rabbit just under the window she suddenly
spread out her hand and made a snatch in the air  She did not
get hold of anything but she heard a little shriek and a fall
and a crash of broken glass from which she concluded that it was
just possible it had fallen into a cucumberframe or something
of the sort

  Next came an angry voicethe RabbitsPat Pat  Where are
you?  And then a voice she had never heard before Sure then
Im here  Digging for apples yer honour

  Digging for apples indeed said the Rabbit angrily  Here
Come and help me out of THIS  Sounds of more broken glass

  Now tell me Pat whats that in the window?

  Sure its an arm yer honour  He pronounced it arrum

  An arm you goose   Who ever saw one that size?  Why it
fills the whole window

  Sure it does yer honour  but its an arm for all that

  Well its got no business there at any rate  go and take it
away

  There was a long silence after this and Alice could only hear
whispers now and then such as Sure I dont like it yer
honour at all at all  Do as I tell you you coward and at
last she spread out her hand again and made another snatch in
the air  This time there were TWO little shrieks and more
sounds of broken glass  What a number of cucumberframes there
must be thought Alice  I wonder what theyll do next  As for
pulling me out of the window I only wish they COULD  Im sure I
dont want to stay in here any longer

  She waited for some time without hearing anything more  at
last came a rumbling of little cartwheels and the sound of a
good many voice all talking together  she made out the words
Wheres the other ladder?Why I hadnt to bring but one
Bills got the otherBill fetch it here ladHere put em up
at this cornerNo tie em together firstthey dont reach half
high enough yetOh theyll do well enough dont be particular
Here Bill catch hold of this ropeWill the roof bear?Mind
that loose slateOh its coming down  Heads below a loud
crashNow who did that?It was Bill I fancyWhos to go
down the chimney?Nay I shant YOU do itThat I wont
thenBills to go downHere Bill the master says youre to
go down the chimney

  Oh So Bills got to come down the chimney has he? said
Alice to herself  Shy they seem to put everything upon Bill
I wouldnt be in Bills place for a good deal  this fireplace is
narrow to be sure but I THINK I can kick a little

  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could and
waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what
sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above her  then saying to herself This is Bill she gave one
sharp kick and waited to see what would happen next

  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes
Bill then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him you by the
hedge then silence and then another confusion of voicesHold
up his headBrandy nowDont choke himHow was it old fellow?
What happened to you?  Tell us all about it

  Last came a little feeble squeaking voice Thats Bill
thought Alice Well I hardly knowNo more thank ye Im
better nowbut Im a deal too flustered to tell youall I know
is something comes at me like a Jackinthebox and up I goes
like a skyrocket

  So you did old fellow said the others

  We must burn the house down said the Rabbits voice and
Alice called out as loud as she could If you do  Ill set
Dinah at you

  There was a dead silence instantly and Alice thought to
herself I wonder what they WILL do next  If they had any
sense theyd take the roof off  After a minute or two they
began moving about again and Alice heard the Rabbit say A
barrowful will do to begin with

  A barrowful of WHAT? thought Alice but she had not long to
doubt for the next moment a shower of little pebbles came
rattling in at the window and some of them hit her in the face
Ill put a stop to this she said to herself and shouted out
Youd better not do that again which produced another dead
silence

  Alice noticed with some surprise that the pebbles were all
turning into little cakes as they lay on the floor and a bright
idea came into her head  If I eat one of these cakes she
thought its sure to make SOME change in my size and as it
cant possibly make me larger it must make me smaller I
suppose

  So she swallowed one of the cakes and was delighted to find
that she began shrinking directly  As soon as she was small
enough to get through the door she ran out of the house and
found quite a crowd of little animals and birds waiting outside
The poor little Lizard Bill was in the middle being held up by
two guineapigs who were giving it something out of a bottle
They all made a rush at Alice the moment she appeared but she
ran off as hard as she could and soon found herself safe in a
thick wood

  The first thing Ive got to do said Alice to herself as she
wandered about in the wood is to grow to my right size again
and the second thing is to find my way into that lovely garden
I think that will be the best plan

  It sounded an excellent plan no doubt and very neatly and
simply arranged the only difficulty was that she had not the
smallest idea how to set about it and while she was peering
about anxiously among the trees a little sharp bark just over
her head made her look up in a great hurry

  An enormous puppy was looking down at her with large round
eyes and feebly stretching out one paw trying to touch her
Poor little thing said Alice in a coaxing tone and she tried
hard to whistle to it but she was terribly frightened all the
time at the thought that it might be hungry in which case it
would be very likely to eat her up in spite of all her coaxing

  Hardly knowing what she did she picked up a little bit of
stick and held it out to the puppy whereupon the puppy jumped
into the air off all its feet at once with a yelp of delight
and rushed at the stick and made believe to worry it then Alice
dodged behind a great thistle to keep herself from being run
over and the moment she appeared on the other side the puppy
made another rush at the stick and tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to get hold of it then Alice thinking it was very
like having a game of play with a carthorse and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet ran round the thistle
again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
stick running a very little way forwards each time and a long
way back and barking hoarsely all the while till at last it sat
down a good way off panting with its tongue hanging out of its
mouth and its great eyes half shut

  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape
so she set off at once and ran till she was quite tired and out
of breath and till the puppys bark sounded quite faint in the
distance

  And yet what a dear little puppy it was said Alice as she
leant against a buttercup to rest herself and fanned herself
with one of the leaves  I should have liked teaching it tricks
very much ifif Id only been the right size to do it  Oh
dear  Id nearly forgotten that Ive got to grow up again  Let
me seehow IS it to be managed?  I suppose I ought to eat or
drink something or other but the great question is what?

  The great question certainly was what?  Alice looked all round
her at the flowers and the blades of grass but she did not see
anything that looked like the right thing to eat or drink under
the circumstances  There was a large mushroom growing near her
about the same height as herself and when she had looked under
it and on both sides of it and behind it it occurred to her
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it

  She stretched herself up on tiptoe and peeped over the edge of
the mushroom and her eyes immediately met those of a large
caterpillar that was sitting on the top with its arms folded
quietly smoking a long hookah and taking not the smallest notice
of her or of anything else



                            CHAPTER V

                    Advice from a Caterpillar


  The Caterpillar and Alice looked at each other for some time in
silence  at last the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and addressed her in a languid sleepy voice

  Who are YOU? said the Caterpillar

  This was not an encouraging opening for a conversation  Alice
replied rather shyly II hardly know sir just at present
at least I know who I WAS when I got up this morning but I think
I must have been changed several times since then

  What do you mean by that? said the Caterpillar sternly
Explain yourself

  I cant explain MYSELF Im afraid sir said Alice because
Im not myself you see

  I dont see said the Caterpillar

  Im afraid I cant put it more clearly Alice replied very
politely for I cant understand it myself to begin with and
being so many different sizes in a day is very confusing

  It isnt said the Caterpillar

  Well perhaps you havent found it so yet said Alice but
when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day you
knowand then after that into a butterfly I should think youll
feel it a little queer wont you?

  Not a bit said the Caterpillar

  Well perhaps your feelings may be different said Alice
all I know is it would feel very queer to ME

  You said the Caterpillar contemptuously  Who are YOU?

  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars
making such VERY short remarks and she drew herself up and said
very gravely I think you ought to tell me who YOU are first

  Why? said the Caterpillar

  Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not
think of any good reason and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
a VERY unpleasant state of mind she turned away

  Come back the Caterpillar called after her  Ive something
important to say

  This sounded promising certainly  Alice turned and came back
again

  Keep your temper said the Caterpillar

  Is that all? said Alice swallowing down her anger as well as
she could

  No said the Caterpillar

  Alice thought she might as well wait as she had nothing else
to do and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
hearing  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking but
at last it unfolded its arms took the hookah out of its mouth
again and said So you think youre changed do you?

  Im afraid I am sir said Alice I cant remember things as
I usedand I dont keep the same size for ten minutes together

  Cant remember WHAT things? said the Caterpillar

  Well Ive tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE" but it
all came different Alice replied in a very melancholy voice

  Repeat "YOU ARE OLD FATHER WILLIAM" said the Caterpillar

  Alice folded her hands and began

    You are old Father William the young man said
      And your hair has become very white
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head
      Do you think at your age it is right?

    In my youth Father William replied to his son
      I feared it might injure the brain
    But now that Im perfectly sure I have none
      Why I do it again and again

    You are old said the youth as I mentioned before
      And have grown most uncommonly fat
    Yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door
      Pray what is the reason of that?

    In my youth said the sage as he shook his grey locks
      I kept all my limbs very supple
    By the use of this ointmentone shilling the box
      Allow me to sell you a couple?

    You are old said the youth and your jaws are too weak
      For anything tougher than suet
    Yet you finished the goose with the bones and the beak
      Pray how did you manage to do it?

    In my youth said his father I took to the law
      And argued each case with my wife
    And the muscular strength which it gave to my jaw
      Has lasted the rest of my life

    You are old said the youth one would hardly suppose
      That your eye was as steady as ever
    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
      What made you so awfully clever?

    I have answered three questions and that is enough
      Said his father dont give yourself airs
