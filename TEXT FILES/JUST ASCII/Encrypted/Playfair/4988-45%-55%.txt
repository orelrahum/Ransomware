comprehensive online working context for humanities scholars that
includes online availability of key bibliographies scholarly feedback
sources analytical tools and publications  MICHELSON noted further
that the movement toward a comprehensive online working context for
humanities scholars is not new  In fact it has been underway for more
than forty years in the humanities since Father Roberto Busa began
developing an electronic concordance of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas
in   What we are witnessing today MICHELSON contended is not the
beginning of this online transition but for at least some humanities
scholars the turning point in the transition from a print to an
electronic working context  Coinciding with the online transition the
second striking change is the extent to which research and education
networks are becoming the new medium of scholarly communication  The
existing Internet and the pending National Education and Research Network
NREN represent the new meeting ground where scholars are going for
bibliographic information scholarly dialogue and feedback the most
current publications in their field and highlevel educational
offerings  Traditional scholarly practices are undergoing tremendous
transformations as a result of the emergence and growing prominence of
what is called networkmediated scholarship

MICHELSON next turned to the second element of the framework she proposed
at the outset of her talk for evaluating the prospects for electronic
text namely the key information technology trends affecting the conduct
of scholarly communication over the next decade   enduser computing
and  connectivity

Enduser computing means that the person touching the keyboard or
performing computations is the same as the person who initiates or
consumes the computation  The emergence of personal computers along
with a host of other forces such as ubiquitous computing advances in
interface design and the online transition is prompting the consumers
of computation to do their own computing and is thus rendering obsolete
the traditional distinction between end users and ultimate users

The trend toward enduser computing is significant to consideration of
the prospects for electronic texts because it means that researchers are
becoming more adept at doing their own computations and thus more
competent in the use of electronic media  By avoiding programmer
intermediaries computation is becoming central to the researchers
thought process  This direct involvement in computing is changing the
researchers perspective on the nature of research itself that is the
kinds of questions that can be posed the analytical methodologies that
can be used the types and amount of sources that are appropriate for
analyses and the form in which findings are presented  The trend toward
enduser computing means that increasingly electronic media and
computation are being infused into all processes of humanities
scholarship inspiring remarkable transformations in scholarly
communication

The trend toward greater connectivity suggests that researchers are using
computation increasingly in network environments  Connectivity is
important to scholarship because it erases the distance that separates
students from teachers and scholars from their colleagues while allowing
users to access remote databases share information in many different
media connect to their working context wherever they are and
collaborate in all phases of research

The combination of the trend toward enduser computing and the trend
toward connectivity suggests that the scholarly use of electronic
resources already evident among some researchers will soon become an
established feature of scholarship  The effects of these trends along
with ongoing changes in scholarly practices point to a future in which
humanities researchers will use computation and electronic communication
to help them formulate ideas access sources perform research
collaborate with colleagues seek peer review publish and disseminate
results and engage in many other professional and educational activities

In summary MICHELSON emphasized four points   A portion of humanities
scholars already consider electronic texts the preferred format for
analysis and dissemination   Scholars are using these electronic
texts in conjunction with other electronic resources in all the
processes of scholarly communication   The humanities scholars
working context is in the process of changing from print technology to
electronic technology in many ways mirroring transformations that have
occurred or are occurring within the scientific community   These
changes are occurring in conjunction with the development of a new
communication medium  research and education networks that are
characterized by their capacity to advance scholarship in a wholly unique
way

MICHELSON also reiterated her three principal arguments  l Electronic
texts are best understood in terms of the relationship to other
electronic resources and the growing prominence of networkmediated
scholarship   The prospects for electronic texts lie in their capacity
to be integrated into the online network of electronic resources that
comprise the new working context for scholars   Retrospective conversion
of portions of the scholarly record should be a key strategy as information
providers respond to changes in scholarly communication practices

                                 


VECCIA  AMs evaluation project and public users of electronic resources
 AM and its design  Site selection and evaluating the Macintosh
implementation of AM  Characteristics of the six public libraries
selected  Characteristics of AMs users in these libraries  Principal
ways AM is being used 


Susan VECCIA team leader and Joanne FREEMAN associate coordinator
American Memory Library of Congress gave a joint presentation  First
by way of introduction VECCIA explained her and FREEMANs roles in
American Memory AM  Serving principally as an observer VECCIA has
assisted with the evaluation project of AM placing AM collections in a
variety of different sites around the country and helping to organize and
implement that project  FREEMAN has been an associate coordinator of AM
and has been involved principally with the interpretative materials
preparing some of the electronic exhibits and printed historical
information that accompanies AM and that is requested by users  VECCIA
and FREEMAN shared anecdotal observations concerning AM with public users
of electronic resources  Notwithstanding a fairly structured evaluation
in progress both VECCIA and FREEMAN chose not to report on specifics in
terms of numbers etc because they felt it was too early in the
evaluation project to do so

AM is an electronic archive of primary source materials from the Library
of Congress selected collections representing a variety of formats
photographs graphic arts recorded sound motion pictures broadsides
and soon pamphlets and books  In terms of the design of this system
the interpretative exhibits have been kept separate from the primary
resources with good reason  Accompanying this collection are printed
documentation and user guides as well as guides that FREEMAN prepared for
teachers so that they may begin using the content of the system at once

VECCIA described the evaluation project before talking about the public
users of AM limiting her remarks to public libraries because FREEMAN
would talk more specifically about schools from kindergarten to twelfth
grade K   Having started in spring  the evaluation currently
involves testing of the Macintosh implementation of AM  Since the
primary goal of this evaluation is to determine the most appropriate
audience or audiences for AM very different sites were selected  This
makes evaluation difficult because of the varying degrees of technology
literacy among the sites  AM is situated in fortyfour locations of
which six are public libraries and sixteen are schools  Represented
among the schools are elementary junior high and high schools
District offices also are involved in the evaluation which will
conclude in summer 

VECCIA focused the remainder of her talk on the six public libraries one
of which doubles as a state library  They represent a range of
geographic areas and a range of demographic characteristics  For
example three are located in urban settings two in rural settings and
one in a suburban setting  A range of technical expertise is to be found
among these facilities as well  For example one is an "Apple library of
the future" while two others are rural oneroom librariesin one AM
sits at the front desk next to a tractor manual

All public libraries have been extremely enthusiastic supportive and
appreciative of the work that AM has been doing  VECCIA characterized
various users  Most users in public libraries describe themselves as
general readers of the students who use AM in the public libraries
those in fourth grade and above seem most interested  Public libraries
in rural sites tend to attract retired people who have been highly
receptive to AM  Users tend to fall into two additional categories
people interested in the content and historical connotations of these
primary resources and those fascinated by the technology  The format
receiving the most comments has been motion pictures  The adult users in
public libraries are more comfortable with IBM computers whereas young
people seem comfortable with either IBM or Macintosh although most of
them seem to come from a Macintosh background  This same tendency is
found in the schools

What kinds of things do users do with AM?  In a public library there are
two main goals or ways that AM is being used  as an individual learning
tool and as a leisure activity  Adult learning was one area that VECCIA
would highlight as a possible application for a tool such as AM  She
described a patron of a rural public library who comes in every day on
his lunch hour and literally reads AM methodically going through the
collection image by image  At the end of his hour he makes an electronic
bookmark puts it in his pocket and returns to work  The next day he
comes in and resumes where he left off  Interestingly this man had
never been in the library before he used AM  In another small rural
library the coordinator reports that AM is a popular activity for some
of the older retired people in the community who ordinarily would not
use "those things"computers  Another example of adult learning in
public libraries is book groups one of which in particular is using AM
as part of its reading on industrialization integration and urbanization
in the early s

One library reports that a family is using AM to help educate their
children  In another instance individuals from a local museum came in
to use AM to prepare an exhibit on toys of the past  These two examples
emphasize the mission of the public library as a cultural institution
reaching out to people who do not have the same resources available to
those who live in a metropolitan area or have access to a major library
One rural library reports that junior high school students in large
numbers came in one afternoon to use AM for entertainment  A number of
public libraries reported great interest among postcard collectors in the
Detroit collection which was essentially a collection of images used on
postcards around the turn of the century  Train buffs are similarly
interested because that was a time of great interest in railroading
People it was found relate to things that they know of firsthand  For
example in both rural public libraries where AM was made available
observers reported that the older people with personal remembrances of
the turn of the century were gravitating to the Detroit collection
These examples served to underscore MICHELSONs observation re the
integration of electronic tools and ideasthat people learn best when
the material relates to something they know

VECCIA made the final point that in many cases AM serves as a
publicrelations tool for the public libraries that are testing it  In
one case AM is being used as a vehicle to secure additional funding for
the library  In another case AM has served as an inspiration to the
staff of a major local public library in the South to think about ways to
make its own collection of photographs more accessible to the public

                                  


FREEMAN  AM and archival electronic resources in a school environment 
Questions concerning context  Questions concerning the electronic format
itself  Computer anxiety  Access and availability of the system 
Hardware  Strengths gained through the use of archival resources in
schools 


Reiterating an observation made by VECCIA that AM is an archival
resource made up of primary materials with very little interpretation
FREEMAN stated that the project has attempted to bridge the gap between
these bare primary materials and a school environment and in that cause
has created guided introductions to AM collections  Loud demand from the
educational community  chiefly from teachers working with the upper
grades of elementary school through high school greeted the announcement
that AM would be tested around the country

FREEMAN reported not only on what was learned about AM in a school
environment but also on several universal questions that were raised
concerning archival electronic resources in schools  She discussed
several strengths of this type of material in a school environment as
opposed to a highly structured resource that offers a limited number of
paths to follow

FREEMAN first raised several questions about using AM in a school
environment  There is often some difficulty in developing a sense of
what the system contains  Many students sit down at a computer resource
and assume that because AM comes from the Library of Congress all of
American history is now at their fingertips  As a result of that sort of
mistaken judgment some students are known to conclude that AM contains
nothing of use to them when they look for one or two things and do not
find them  It is difficult to discover that middle ground where one has
a sense of what the system contains  Some students grope toward the idea
of an archive a new idea to them since they have not previously
experienced what it means to have access to a vast body of somewhat
random information

Other questions raised by FREEMAN concerned the electronic format itself
For instance in a school environment it is often difficult both for
teachers and students to gain a sense of what it is they are viewing
They understand that it is a visual image but they do not necessarily
know that it is a postcard from the turn of the century a panoramic
photograph or even machinereadable text of an eighteenthcentury
broadside a twentiethcentury printed book or a nineteenthcentury
diary  That distinction is often difficult for people in a school
environment to grasp  Because of that it occasionally becomes difficult
to draw conclusions from what one is viewing

FREEMAN also noted the obvious fear of the computer which constitutes a
difficulty in using an electronic resource  Though students in general
did not suffer from this anxiety several older students feared that they
were computerilliterate an assumption that became selffulfilling when
they searched for something but failed to find it  FREEMAN said she
believed that some teachers also fear computer resources because they
believe they lack complete control  FREEMAN related the example of
teachers shooing away students because it was not their time to use the
system  This was a case in which the situation had to be extremely
structured so that the teachers would not feel that they had lost their
grasp on what the system contained

A final question raised by FREEMAN concerned access and availability of
the system  She noted the occasional existence of a gap in communication
between school librarians and teachers  Often AM sits in a school
library and the librarian is the person responsible for monitoring the
system  Teachers do not always take into their world new library
resources about which the librarian is excited  Indeed at the sites
where AM had been used most effectively within a library the librarian
was required to go to specific teachers and instruct them in its use  As
a result several AM sites will have inservice sessions over a summer
in the hope that perhaps with a more individualized link teachers will
be more likely to use the resource

A related issue in the school context concerned the number of
workstations available at any one location  Centralization of equipment
at the district level with teachers invited to download things and walk
away with them proved unsuccessful because the hours these offices were
open were also school hours

Another issue was hardware  As VECCIA observed a range of sites exists
some technologically advanced and others essentially acquiring their
first computer for the primary purpose of using it in conjunction with
AMs testing  Users at technologically sophisticated sites want even
more sophisticated hardware so that they can perform even more
sophisticated tasks with the materials in AM  But once they acquire a
newer piece of hardware they must learn how to use that also at an
unsophisticated site it takes an extremely long time simply to become
accustomed to the computer not to mention the program offered with the
computer  All of these small issues raise one large question namely
are systems like AM truly rewarding in a school environment or do they
simply act as innovative toys that do little more than spark interest?

FREEMAN contended that the evaluation project has revealed several strengths
that were gained through the use of archival resources in schools including

      Psychic rewards from using AM as a vast rich database with
     teachers assigning various projects to studentsoral presentations
     written reports a documentary a turnofthecentury newspaper
     projects that start with the materials in AM but are completed using
     other resources AM thus is used as a research tool in conjunction
     with other electronic resources as well as with books and items in
     the library where the system is set up

      Students are acquiring computer literacy in a humanities context

      This sort of system is overcoming the isolation between disciplines
     that often exists in schools  For example many English teachers are
     requiring their students to write papers on historical topics
     represented in AM  Numerous teachers have reported that their
     students are learning critical thinking skills using the system

      On a broader level AM is introducing primary materials not only
     to students but also to teachers in an environment where often
     simply none existan exciting thing for the students because it
     helps them learn to conduct research to interpret and to draw
     their own conclusions  In learning to conduct research and what it
     means students are motivated to seek knowledge  That relates to
     another positive outcomea high level of personal involvement of
     students with the materials in this system and greater motivation to
     conduct their own research and draw their own conclusions

      Perhaps the most ironic strength of these kinds of archival
     electronic resources is that many of the teachers AM interviewed
     were desperate it is no exaggeration to say not only for primary
     materials but for unstructured primary materials  These would they
     thought foster personally motivated research exploration and
     excitement in their students  Indeed these materials have done
     just that  Ironically however this lack of structure produces
     some of the confusion to which the newness of these kinds of
     resources may also contribute  The key to effective use of archival
     products in a school environment is a clear effective introduction
     to the system and to what it contains

                                 


DISCUSSION  Nothing known quantitatively about the number of
humanities scholars who must see the original versus those who would
settle for an edited transcript or about the ways in which humanities
scholars are using information technology  Firm conclusions concerning
the manner and extent of the use of supporting materials in print
provided by AM to await completion of evaluative study  A listeners
reflections on additional applications of electronic texts  Role of
electronic resources in teaching elementary research skills to students 


During the discussion that followed the presentations by MICHELSON
VECCIA and FREEMAN additional points emerged

LESK asked if MICHELSON could give any quantitative estimate of the
number of humanities scholars who must see or want to see the original
or the best possible version of the material versus those who typically
would settle for an edited transcript  While unable to provide a figure
she offered her impressions as an archivist who has done some reference
work and has discussed this issue with other archivists who perform
reference that those who use archives and those who use primary sources
for what would be considered very highlevel scholarly research as
opposed to say undergraduate papers were few in number especially
given the public interest in using primary sources to conduct
genealogical or avocational research and the kind of professional
research done by people in private industry or the federal government
More important in MICHELSONs view was that quantitatively nothing is
known about the ways in which for example humanities scholars are using
information technology  No studies exist to offer guidance in creating
strategies  The most recent study was conducted in  by the American
Council of Learned Societies ACLS and what it showed was that 
percent of humanities scholars at that time were using computers  That
constitutes the extent of our knowledge

Concerning AMs strategy for orienting people toward the scope of
electronic resources FREEMAN could offer no hard conclusions at this
point because she and her colleagues were still waiting to see
particularly in the schools what has been made of their efforts  Within
the system however AM has provided what are called electronic exhibits
such as introductions to time periods and materialsand these are
intended to offer a student user a sense of what a broadside is  and what
it might tell her or him  But FREEMAN conceded that the project staff
would have to talk with students next year after teachers have had a
summer to use the materials and attempt to discover what the students
were learning from the materials  In addition FREEMAN described
supporting materials in print provided by AM at the request of local
teachers during a meeting held at LC  These included time lines
bibliographies and other materials that could be reproduced on a
photocopier in a classroom  Teachers could walk away with and use these
and in this way gain a better understanding of the contents  But again
reaching firm conclusions concerning the manner and extent of their use
would have to wait until next year

As to the changes she saw occurring at the National Archives and Records
Administration NARA as a result of the increasing emphasis on
technology in scholarly research MICHELSON stated that NARA at this
point was absorbing the report by her and Jeff Rothenberg addressing
strategies for the archival profession in general although not for the
National Archives specifically  NARA is just beginning to establish its
role and what it can do  In terms of changes and initiatives that NARA
can take no clear response could be given at this time

GREENFIELD remarked two trends mentioned in the session  Reflecting on
DALYs opening comments on how he could have used a Latin collection of
text in an electronic form he said that at first he thought most scholars
would be unwilling to do that  But as he thought of that in terms of the
original meaning of researchthat is having already mastered these texts
researching them for critical and comparative purposesfor the first time
the electronic format made a lot of sense  GREENFIELD could envision
growing numbers of scholars learning the new technologies for that very
aspect of their scholarship and for conveniences sake

Listening to VECCIA and FREEMAN GREENFIELD thought of an additional
application of electronic texts  He realized that AM could be used as a
guide to lead someone to original sources  Students cannot be expected
to have mastered these sources things they have never known about
before  Thus AM is leading them in theory to a vast body of
information and giving them a superficial overview of it enabling them
to select parts of it  GREENFIELD asked if any evidence exists that this
resource will indeed teach the new user the K students how to do
research  Scholars already know how to do research and are applying
these new tools  But he wondered why students would go beyond picking
out things that were most exciting to them

FREEMAN conceded the correctness of GREENFIELDs observation as applied
to a school environment  The risk is that a student would sit down at a
system play with it find some things of interest and then walk away
But in the relatively controlled situation of a school library much will
depend on the instructions a teacher or a librarian gives a student  She
viewed the situation not as one of finetuning research skills but of
involving students at a personal level in understanding and researching
things  Given the guidance one can receive at school it then becomes
possible to teach elementary research skills to students which in fact
one particular librarian said she was teaching her fifth graders
FREEMAN concluded that introducing the idea of following ones own path
of inquiry which is essentially what research entails involves more
than teaching specific skills  To these comments VECCIA added the
observation that the individual teacher and the use of a creative
resource rather than AM itself seemed to make the key difference
Some schools and some teachers are making excellent use of the nature
of critical thinking and teaching skills she said

Concurring with these remarks DALY closed the session with the thought that
the more that producers produced for teachers and for scholars to use with
their students the more successful their electronic products would prove

                                 

SESSION II  SHOW AND TELL

Jacqueline HESS director National Demonstration Laboratory served as
moderator of the "showandtell" session  She noted that a
questionandanswer period would follow each presentation


MYLONAS  Overview and content of Perseus  Perseus primary materials
exist in a systemindependent archival form  A concession  Textual
aspects of Perseus  Tools to use with the Greek text  Prepared indices
and fulltext searches in Perseus  EnglishGreek word search leads to
close study of words and concepts  Navigating Perseus by tracing down
indices  Using the iconography to perform research 


Elli MYLONAS managing editor Perseus Project Harvard University first
gave an overview of Perseus a large collaborative effort based at
Harvard University but with contributors and collaborators located at
numerous universities and colleges in the United States eg Bowdoin
Maryland Pomona Chicago Virginia  Funded primarily by the
AnnenbergCPB Project with additional funding from Apple Harvard and
the Packard Humanities Institute among others Perseus is a multimedia
hypertextual database for teaching and research on classical Greek
civilization which was released in February  in version  and
distributed by Yale University Press

Consisting entirely of primary materials Perseus includes ancient Greek
texts and translations of those texts catalog entriesthat is museum
catalog entries not library catalog entrieson vases sites coins
sculpture and archaeological objects maps and a dictionary among
other sources  The number of objects and the objects for which catalog
entries exist are accompanied by thousands of color images which
constitute a major feature of the database  Perseus contains
approximately  megabytes of text an amount that will double in
subsequent versions  In addition to these primary materials the Perseus
Project has been building tools for using them making access and
navigation easier the goal being to build part of the electronic
environment discussed earlier in the morning in which students or
scholars can work with their sources

The demonstration of Perseus will show only a fraction of the real work
that has gone into it because the project had to face the dilemma of
what to enter when putting something into machinereadable form  should
one aim for very high quality or make concessions in order to get the
material in?  Since Perseus decided to opt for very high quality all of
its primary materials exist in a systemindependentinsofar as it is
possible to be systemindependentarchival form  Deciding what that
archival form would be and attaining it required much work and thought
For example all the texts are marked up in SGML which will be made
compatible with the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative TEI when
they are issued

Drawings are postscript files not meeting international standards but
at least designed to go across platforms  Images or rather the real
archival forms consist of the best available slides which are being
digitized  Much of the catalog material exists in database forma form
that the average user could use manipulate and display on a personal
computer but only at great cost  Thus this is where the concession
comes in  All of this rich wellmarkedup information is stripped of
much of its content the images are converted into bitmaps and the text
into small formatted chunks  All this information can then be imported
into HyperCard and run on a midrange Macintosh which is what Perseus
users have  This fact has made it possible for Perseus to attain wide
use fairly rapidly  Without those archival forms the HyperCard version
being demonstrated could not be made easily and the project could not
have the potential to move to other forms and machines and software as
they appear none of which information is in Perseus on the CD

Of the numerous multimedia aspects of Perseus MYLONAS focused on the
textual  Part of what makes Perseus such a pleasure to use MYLONAS
said is this effort at seamless integration and the ability to move
around both visual and textual material  Perseus also made the decision
not to attempt to interpret its material any more than one interprets by
selecting  But MYLONAS emphasized Perseus is not courseware  No
syllabus exists  There is no effort to define how one teaches a topic
using Perseus although the project may eventually collect papers by
people who have used it to teach  Rather Perseus aims to provide
primary material in a kind of electronic library an electronic sandbox
so to say in which students and scholars who are working on this
material can explore by themselves  With that MYLONAS demonstrated
Perseus beginning with the Perseus gateway the first thing one sees
upon opening Perseusan effort in part to solve the contextualizing
problemwhich tells the user what the system contains

MYLONAS demonstrated only a very small portion beginning with primary
texts and running off the CDROM  Having selected Aeschylus Prometheus
Bound which was viewable in Greek and English pretty much in the same
segments together MYLONAS demonstrated tools to use with the Greek text
something not possible with a book  looking up the dictionary entry form
of an unfamiliar word in Greek after subjecting it to Perseus
morphological analysis for all the texts  After finding out about a
word a user may then decide to see if it is used anywhere else in Greek
Because vast amounts of indexing support all of the primary material one
can find out where else all forms of a particular Greek word appear
often not a trivial matter because Greek is highly inflected  Further
since the story of Prometheus has to do with the origins of sacrifice a
user may wish to study and explore sacrifice in Greek literature by
typing sacrifice into a small window a user goes to the EnglishGreek
word listsomething one cannot do without the computer Perseus has
indexed the definitions of its dictionarythe string sacrifice appears
in the definitions of these sixtyfive words  One may then find out
where any of those words is used in the works of a particular author
The English definitions are not lemmatized

All of the indices driving this kind of usage were originally devised for
speed MYLONAS observed in other words all that kind of information
all forms of all words where they exist the dictionary form they belong
towere collected into databases which will expedite searching  Then
it was discovered that one can do things searching in these databases
that could not be done searching in the full texts  Thus although there
are fulltext searches in Perseus much of the work is done behind the
scenes using prepared indices  Re the indexing that is done behind the
scenes MYLONAS pointed out that without the SGML forms of the text it
could not be done effectively  Much of this indexing is based on the
structures that are made explicit by the SGML tagging

It was found that one of the things many of Perseus nonGreekreading
users do is start from the dictionary and then move into the close study
of words and concepts via this kind of EnglishGreek word search by which
means they might select a concept  This exercise has been assigned to
students in core courses at Harvardto study a concept by looking for the
English word in the dictionary finding the Greek words and then finding
the words in the Greek but of course reading across in the English
That tells them a great deal about what a translation means as well

Should one also wish to see images that have to do with sacrifice that
person would go to the object key word search which allows one to
perform a similar kind of index retrieval on the database of
archaeological objects  Without words pictures are useless Perseus has
not reached the point where it can do much with images that are not
cataloged  Thus although it is possible in Perseus with text and images
to navigate by knowing where one wants to end upfor example a
redfigure vase from the Boston Museum of Fine Artsone can perform this
kind of navigation very easily by tracing down indices  MYLONAS
illustrated several generic scenes of sacrifice on vases  The features
demonstrated derived from Perseus  version  will implement even
better means of retrieval

MYLONAS closed by looking at one of the pictures and noting again that
one can do a great deal of research using the iconography as well as the
texts  For instance students in a core course at Harvard this year were
highly interested in Greek concepts of foreigners and representations of
nonGreeks  So they performed a great deal of research both with texts
eg Herodotus and with iconography on vases and coins on how the
Greeks portrayed nonGreeks  At the same time art historians who study
iconography were also interested and were able to use this material

                                 


DISCUSSION  Indexing and searchability of all English words in Perseus 
Several features of Perseus   Several levels of customization
possible  Perseus used for general education  Perseus effects on
education  Contextual information in Perseus  Main challenge and
emphasis of Perseus 


Several points emerged in the discussion that followed MYLONASs presentation

Although MYLONAS had not demonstrated Perseus ability to crosssearch
documents she confirmed that all English words in Perseus are indexed
and can be searched  So for example sacrifice could have been searched
in all texts the historical essay and all the catalogue entries with
their descriptionsin short in all of Perseus

Boolean logic is not in Perseus  but will be added to the next
version although an effort is being made not to restrict Perseus to a
database in which one just performs searching Boolean or otherwise  It
is possible to move laterally through the documents by selecting a word
one is interested in and selecting an area of information one is
interested in and trying to look that word up in that area

Since Perseus was developed in HyperCard several levels of customization
are possible  Simple authoring tools exist that allow one to create
annotated paths through the information which are useful for notetaking
and for guided tours for teaching purposes and for expository writing
With a little more ingenuity it is possible to begin to add or substitute
material in Perseus

Perseus has not been used so much for classics education as for general
education where it seemed to have an impact on the students in the core
course at Harvard a general required course that students must take in
certain areas  Students were able to use primary material much more

The Perseus Project has an evaluation team at the University of Maryland
that has been documenting Perseus effects on education  Perseus is very
popular and anecdotal evidence indicates that it is having an effect at
places other than Harvard for example test sites at Ball State
University Drury College and numerous small places where opportunities
to use vast amounts of primary data may not exist  One documented effect
is that archaeological anthropological and philological research is
being done by the same person instead of by three different people

The contextual information in Perseus includes an overview essay a
fairly linear historical essay on the fifth century BC that provides
links into the primary material eg Herodotus Thucydides and
Plutarch via small gray underscoring on the screen of linked
passages  These are handmade links into other material

To different extents most of the production work was done at Harvard
where the people and the equipment are located  Much of the
collaborative activity involved data collection and structuring because
the main challenge and the emphasis of Perseus is the gathering of
primary material that is building a useful environment for studying
classical Greece collecting data and making it useful
Systemsbuilding is definitely not the main concern  Thus much of the
work has involved writing essays collecting information rewriting it
and tagging it  That can be done off site  The creative link for the
overview essay as well as for both systems and data was collaborative
and was forged via Email and paper mail with professors at Pomona and
