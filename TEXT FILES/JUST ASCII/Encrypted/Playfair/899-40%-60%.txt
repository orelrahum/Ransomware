    Awn and his supporters feared Taif would diminish Christian power in
    Lebanon and increase the influence of Syria Awn was granted amnesty and
    allowed to travel in France in August l Since the removal of Awn the
    Lebanese Government has made substantial progress in strengthening the
    central government rebuilding government institutions and extending its
    authority throughout the nation The LAF has deployed from Beirut north
    along the coast road to Tripoli southeast into the Shuf mountains and
    south to Sidon and Tyre Many militiamen from Christian and Muslim groups
    have evacuated Beirut for their strongholds in the north south and east of
    the country Some heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned
    over to the government or sold outside the country which has begun a plan
    to integrate some militiamen into the military and the internal security
    forces Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in
    May  Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops which
    are deployed in Beirut its southern suburbs the Bekaa Valley and northern
    Lebanon Iran also maintains a small contingent of revolutionary guards in
    the Bekaa Valley to support Lebanese Islamic fundamentalist groups Israel
    withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in  although it still
    retains troops in a kmdeep security zone north of its border with
    Lebanon Israel arms and trains the Army of South Lebanon ASL which also
    occupies the security zone and is Israels first line of defense against
    attacks on its northern border The following description is based on the

Lebanon Economy

Overview
    Since  civil war has seriously damaged Lebanons economic
    infrastructure cut national output by half and all but ended Lebanons
    position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub Following October
     however a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin
    restoring control in Beirut collect taxes and regain access to key port
    and government facilities The battered economy has also been propped up by
    a financially sound banking system and resilient small and mediumscale
    manufacturers Family remittances banking transactions manufactured and
    farm exports the narcotics trade and international emergency aid are main
    sources of foreign exchange In the relatively settled year of 
    industrial production agricultural output and exports showed substantial
    gains The further rebuilding of the warravaged country could provide a
    major stimulus to the economy in  provided that the political and
    military situation remains reasonably calm
