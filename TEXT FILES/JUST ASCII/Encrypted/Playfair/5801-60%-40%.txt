  Yes said Alice Ive often seen them at dinn she
checked herself hastily

  I dont know where Dinn may be said the Mock Turtle but
if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre
like

  I believe so Alice replied thoughtfully  They have their
tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs

  Youre wrong about the crumbs said the Mock Turtle
crumbs would all wash off in the sea  But they HAVE their tails
in their mouths and the reason is here the Mock Turtle
yawned and shut his eyesTell her about the reason and all
that he said to the Gryphon

  The reason is said the Gryphon that they WOULD go with
the lobsters to the dance  So they got thrown out to sea  So
they had to fall a long way  So they got their tails fast in
their mouths  So they couldnt get them out again  Thats all

  Thank you said Alice its very interesting  I never knew
so much about a whiting before

  I can tell you more than that if you like said the
Gryphon  Do you know why its called a whiting?

  I never thought about it said Alice  Why?

  IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES the Gryphon replied very
solemnly

  Alice was thoroughly puzzled  Does the boots and shoes she
repeated in a wondering tone

  Why what are YOUR shoes done with? said the Gryphon  I
mean what makes them so shiny?

  Alice looked down at them and considered a little before she
gave her answer  Theyre done with blacking I believe

  Boots and shoes under the sea the Gryphon went on in a deep
voice are done with a whiting  Now you know

  And what are they made of? Alice asked in a tone of great
curiosity

  Soles and eels of course the Gryphon replied rather
impatiently  any shrimp could have told you that

  If Id been the whiting said Alice whose thoughts were
still running on the song Id have said to the porpoise "Keep
back please  we dont want YOU with us"

  They were obliged to have him with them the Mock Turtle
said  no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise

  Wouldnt it really? said Alice in a tone of great surprise

  Of course not said the Mock Turtle  why if a fish came
to ME and told me he was going a journey I should say "With
what porpoise?"

  Dont you mean "purpose"? said Alice

  I mean what I say the Mock Turtle replied in an offended
tone  And the Gryphon added Come lets hear some of YOUR
adventures

  I could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning
said Alice a little timidly  but its no use going back to
yesterday because I was a different person then

  Explain all that said the Mock Turtle

  No no  The adventures first said the Gryphon in an
impatient tone  explanations take such a dreadful time

  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when
she first saw the White Rabbit  She was a little nervous about
it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on
each side and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide but she
gained courage as she went on  Her listeners were perfectly
quiet till she got to the part about her repeating YOU ARE OLD
FATHER WILLIAM to the Caterpillar and the words all coming
different and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath and said
Thats very curious

  Its all about as curious as it can be said the Gryphon

  It all came different the Mock Turtle repeated
thoughtfully  I should like to hear her try and repeat
something now  Tell her to begin  He looked at the Gryphon as
if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice

  Stand up and repeat "TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD" said
the Gryphon

  How the creatures order one about and make one repeat
lessons thought Alice I might as well be at school at once
However she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so
full of the Lobster Quadrille that she hardly knew what she was
saying and the words came very queer indeed

    Tis the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare
    "You have baked me too brown I must sugar my hair"
    As a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose
    Trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes

              later editions continued as follows
    When the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark
    And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark
    But when the tide rises and sharks are around
    His voice has a timid and tremulous sound

  Thats different from what I used to say when I was a child
said the Gryphon

  Well I never heard it before said the Mock Turtle but it
sounds uncommon nonsense

  Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her
hands wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way
again

  I should like to have it explained said the Mock Turtle

  She cant explain it said the Gryphon hastily  Go on with
the next verse

  But about his toes? the Mock Turtle persisted  How COULD
he turn them out with his nose you know?

  Its the first position in dancing Alice said but was
dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the
subject

  Go on with the next verse the Gryphon repeated impatiently
it begins "I passed by his garden"

  Alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would
all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice

    I passed by his garden and marked with one eye
    How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie

        later editions continued as follows
    The Panther took piecrust and gravy and meat
    While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat
    When the pie was all finished the Owl as a boon
    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon
    While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl
    And concluded the banquet

  What IS the use of repeating all that stuff the Mock Turtle
interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on?  Its by far
the most confusing thing I ever heard

  Yes I think youd better leave off said the Gryphon  and
Alice was only too glad to do so

  Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille? the
Gryphon went on  Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you
a song?

  Oh a song please if the Mock Turtle would be so kind
Alice replied so eagerly that the Gryphon said in a rather
offended tone Hm No accounting for tastes  Sing her "Turtle
Soup" will you old fellow?

  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes
choked with sobs to sing this


    Beautiful Soup so rich and green
    Waiting in a hot tureen
    Who for such dainties would not stoop?
    Soup of the evening beautiful Soup
    Soup of the evening beautiful Soup
        Beauootiful Soooop
        Beauootiful Soooop
    Soooop of the eeevening
        Beautiful beautiful Soup

    Beautiful Soup  Who cares for fish
    Game or any other dish?
    Who would not give all else for two p
    ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
        Beauootiful Soooop
        Beauootiful Soooop
    Soooop of the eeevening
        Beautiful beautiFUL SOUP

  Chorus again cried the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle had
just begun to repeat it when a cry of The trials beginning
was heard in the distance

  Come on cried the Gryphon and taking Alice by the hand
it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song

  What trial is it? Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon
only answered Come on and ran the faster while more and more
faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the
melancholy words

    Soooop of the eeevening
        Beautiful beautiful Soup



                           CHAPTER XI

                      Who Stole the Tarts?


  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts
of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards
the Knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on
each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the
other  In the very middle of the court was a table with a large
dish of tarts upon it  they looked so good that it made Alice
quite hungry to look at themI wish theyd get the trial done
she thought and hand round the refreshments  But there seemed
to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about
her to pass away the time

  Alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had
read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that
she knew the name of nearly everything there  Thats the
judge she said to herself because of his great wig

  The judge by the way was the King and as he wore his crown
over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he
did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly
not becoming

  And thats the jurybox thought Alice and those twelve
creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because
some of them were animals and some were birds I suppose they
are the jurors  She said this last word two or three times over
to herself being rather proud of it  for she thought and
rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the
meaning of it at all  However jurymen would have done just
as well

  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
What are they doing?  Alice whispered to the Gryphon  They
cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun

  Theyre putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in
reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the
trial

  Stupid things Alice began in a loud indignant voice but
she stopped hastily for the White Rabbit cried out Silence in
the court and the King put on his spectacles and looked
anxiously round to make out who was talking

  Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their
shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things
on their slates and she could even make out that one of them
didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his
neighbour to tell him  A nice muddle their slatesll be in
before the trials over thought Alice

  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked  This of course
Alice could not stand and she went round the court and got
behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it
away  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was
Bill the Lizard could not make out at all what had become of
it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write
with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very
little use as it left no mark on the slate

  Herald read the accusation said the King

  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and
then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows

    The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts
          All on a summer day
      The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts
          And took them quite away

  Consider your verdict the King said to the jury

  Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted  Theres
a great deal to come before that

  Call the first witness said the King and the White Rabbit
blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out First
witness

  The first witness was the Hatter  He came in with a teacup in
one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other  I beg
pardon your Majesty he began for bringing these in  but I
hadnt quite finished my tea when I was sent for

  You ought to have finished said the King  When did you
begin?

  The Hatter looked at the March Hare who had followed him into
the court arminarm with the Dormouse  Fourteenth of March I
think it was he said

  Fifteenth said the March Hare

  Sixteenth added the Dormouse

  Write that down the King said to the jury and the jury
eagerly wrote down all three dates on their slates and then
added them up and reduced the answer to shillings and pence

  Take off your hat the King said to the Hatter

  It isnt mine said the Hatter

  Stolen the King exclaimed turning to the jury who
instantly made a memorandum of the fact

  I keep them to sell the Hatter added as an explanation
Ive none of my own  Im a hatter

  Here the Queen put on her spectacles and began staring at the
Hatter who turned pale and fidgeted

  Give your evidence said the King and dont be nervous or
Ill have you executed on the spot

  This did not seem to encourage the witness at all  he kept
shifting from one foot to the other looking uneasily at the
Queen and in his confusion he bit a large piece out of his
teacup instead of the breadandbutter

  Just at this moment Alice felt a very curious sensation which
puzzled her a good deal until she made out what it was  she was
beginning to grow larger again and she thought at first she
would get up and leave the court but on second thoughts she
decided to remain where she was as long as there was room for
her

  I wish you wouldnt squeeze so said the Dormouse who was
sitting next to her  I can hardly breathe

  I cant help it said Alice very meekly  Im growing

  Youve no right to grow here said the Dormouse

  Dont talk nonsense said Alice more boldly  you know
youre growing too

  Yes but I grow at a reasonable pace said the Dormouse
not in that ridiculous fashion  And he got up very sulkily
and crossed over to the other side of the court

  All this time the Queen had never left off staring at the
Hatter and just as the Dormouse crossed the court she said to
one of the officers of the court Bring me the list of the
singers in the last concert on which the wretched Hatter
trembled so that he shook both his shoes off

  Give your evidence the King repeated angrily or Ill have
you executed whether youre nervous or not

  Im a poor man your Majesty the Hatter began in a
trembling voice and I hadnt begun my teanot above a week
or soand what with the breadandbutter getting so thinand
the twinkling of the tea

  The twinkling of the what? said the King

  It began with the tea the Hatter replied

  Of course twinkling begins with a T said the King sharply
Do you take me for a dunce?  Go on

  Im a poor man the Hatter went on and most things
twinkled after thatonly the March Hare said

  I didnt the March Hare interrupted in a great hurry

  You did said the Hatter

  I deny it said the March Hare

  He denies it said the King  leave out that part

  Well at any rate the Dormouse said the Hatter went on
looking anxiously round to see if he would deny it too  but the
Dormouse denied nothing being fast asleep

  After that continued the Hatter I cut some more bread
andbutter

  But what did the Dormouse say? one of the jury asked

  That I cant remember said the Hatter

  You MUST remember remarked the King or Ill have you
executed

  The miserable Hatter dropped his teacup and breadandbutter
and went down on one knee  Im a poor man your Majesty he
began

  Youre a very poor speaker said the King

  Here one of the guineapigs cheered and was immediately
suppressed by the officers of the court  As that is rather a
hard word I will just explain to you how it was done  They had
a large canvas bag which tied up at the mouth with strings
into this they slipped the guineapig heYN GHDBP LAC GRSR LQF
