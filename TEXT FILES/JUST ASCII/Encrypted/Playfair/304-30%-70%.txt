He with a crew whom like ambition joins
With him or under him to tyrannize
Marching from Eden towards the west shall find
The plain wherein a black bituminous gurge
Boils out from under ground the mouth of Hell
Of brick and of that stuff they cast to build
A city and tower whose top may reach to Heaven
And get themselves a name lest far dispersed
In foreign lands their memory be lost
Regardless whether good or evil fame
But God who oft descends to visit men
Unseen and through their habitations walks
To mark their doings them beholding soon
Comes down to see their city ere the tower
Obstruct Heaventowers and in derision sets
Upon their tongues a various spirit to rase
Quite out their native language and instead
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
Among the builders each to other calls
Not understood till hoarse and all in rage
As mocked they storm great laughter was in Heaven
And looking down to see the hubbub strange
And hear the din  Thus was the building left
Ridiculous and the work Confusion named
Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeased
O execrable son so to aspire
Above his brethren to himself assuming
Authority usurped from God not given
He gave us only over beast fish fowl
Dominion absolute that right we hold
By his donation but man over men
He made not lord such title to himself
Reserving human left from human free
But this usurper his encroachment proud
Stays not on Man to God his tower intends
Siege and defiance  Wretched manwhat food
Will he convey up thither to sustain
Himself and his rash army where thin air
Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross
And famish him of breath if not of bread?
To whom thus Michael  Justly thou abhorrest
That son who on the quiet state of men
Such trouble brought affecting to subdue
Rational liberty yet know withal
Since thy original lapse true liberty
Is lost which always with right reason dwells
Twinned and from her hath no dividual being
Reason in man obscured or not obeyed
Immediately inordinate desires
And upstart passions catch the government
From reason and to servitude reduce
Man till then free  Therefore since he permits
Within himself unworthy powers to reign
Over free reason God in judgement just
Subjects him from without to violent lords
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
His outward freedom  Tyranny must be
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low
From virtue which is reason that no wrong
But justice and some fatal curse annexed
Deprives them of their outward liberty
Their inward lost  Witness the irreverent son
Of him who built the ark who for the shame
Done to his father heard this heavy curse
Servant of servants on his vicious race
Thus will this latter as the former world
Still tend from bad to worse till God at last
Wearied with their iniquities withdraw
His presence from among them and avert
His holy eyes resolving from thenceforth
To leave them to their own polluted ways
And one peculiar nation to select
From all the rest of whom to be invoked
A nation from one faithful man to spring
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing
Bred up in idolworship  O that men
Canst thou believe? should be so stupid grown
While yet the patriarch lived who scaped the flood
As to forsake the living God and fall
To worship their own work in wood and stone
For Gods  Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes
To call by vision from his fathers house
His kindred and false Gods into a land
Which he will show him and from him will raise
A mighty nation and upon him shower
His benediction so that in his seed
All nations shall be blest he straight obeys
Not knowing to what land yet firm believes
I see him but thou canst not with what faith
He leaves his Gods his friends and native soil
Ur of Chaldaea passing now the ford
To Haran after him a cumbrous train
Of herds and flocks and numerous servitude
Not wandering poor but trusting all his wealth
With God who called him in a land unknown
Canaan he now attains I see his tents
Pitched about Sechem and the neighbouring plain
Of Moreh there by promise he receives
Gift to his progeny of all that land
From Hameth northward to the Desart south
Things by their names I call though yet unnamed
From Hermon east to the great western Sea
Mount Hermon yonder sea each place behold
In prospect as I point them on the shore
Mount Carmel here the doublefounted stream
Jordan true limit eastward but his sons
Shall dwell to Senir that long ridge of hills
This ponder that all nations of the earth
Shall in his seed be blessed  By that seed
Is meant thy great Deliverer who shall bruise
The Serpents head whereof to thee anon
Plainlier shall be revealed  This patriarch blest
Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call
A son and of his son a grandchild leaves
Like him in faith in wisdom and renown
The grandchild with twelve sons increased departs
From Canaan to a land hereafter called
Egypt divided by the river Nile
See where it flows disgorging at seven mouths
Into the sea To sojourn in that land
He comes invited by a younger son
In time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds
Raise him to be the second in that realm
Of Pharaoh There he dies and leaves his race
Growing into a nation and now grown
Suspected to a sequent king who seeks
To stop their overgrowth as inmate guests
Too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves
Inhospitably and kills their infant males
Till by two brethren these two brethren call
Moses and Aaron sent from God to claim
His people from enthralment they return
With glory and spoil back to their promised land
But first the lawless tyrant who denies
To know their God or message to regard
Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire
To blood unshed the rivers must be turned
Frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill
With loathed intrusion and fill all the land
His cattle must of rot and murren die
Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss
And all his people thunder mixed with hail
Hail mixed with fire must rend the Egyptians sky
And wheel on the earth devouring where it rolls
What it devours not herb or fruit or grain
A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down
Must eat and on the ground leave nothing green
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds
Palpable darkness and blot out three days
Last with one midnight stroke all the firstborn
Of Egypt must lie dead  Thus with ten wounds
The riverdragon tamed at length submits
To let his sojourners depart and oft
Humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice
More hardened after thaw till in his rage
Pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea
Swallows him with his host but thSU BQPP HELB
