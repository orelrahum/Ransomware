bounds of private research though exporting tag files from a CDROM
could serve just as well  Since no one on the board could possibly
anticipate each and every way in which a scholar might choose to mine
this data bank it was decided to satisfy the basics and make some
provisions for what might come   Not to encode the database would rob
it of the interchangeability and portability these important texts should
accommodate  For CALALUCA the extensive options presented by fulltext
searching require care in text selection and strongly support encoding of
data to facilitate the widest possible search strategies  Better
software can always be created but summoning the resources the people
and the energy to reconvert the text is another matter

PLD is being encoded captured and distributed because to
ChadwyckHealey and the board it offers the widest possible array of
future research applications that can be seen today  CALALUCA concluded
by urging the encoding of all important text sources in whatever way
seems most appropriate and durable at the time without blanching at the
thought that ones work may require emendation in the future  Thus
ChadwyckHealey produced a very large humanities text database before the
final release of the TEI Guidelines
