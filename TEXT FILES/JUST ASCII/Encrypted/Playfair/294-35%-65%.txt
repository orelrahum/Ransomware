Of some rich burgher whose substantial doors
Crossbarred and bolted fast fear no assault
In at the window climbs or oer the tiles
So clomb this first grand thief into Gods fold
So since into his church lewd hirelings climb
Thence up he flew and on the tree of life
The middle tree and highest there that grew
Sat like a cormorant yet not true life
Thereby regained but sat devising death
To them who lived nor on the virtue thought
Of that lifegiving plant but only used
For prospect what well used had been the pledge
Of immortality  So little knows
Any but God alone to value right
The good before him but perverts best things
To worst abuse or to their meanest use
Beneath him with new wonder now he views
To all delight of human sense exposed
In narrow room Natures whole wealth yea more
A Heaven on Earth  For blissful Paradise
Of God the garden was by him in the east
Of Eden planted Eden stretched her line
From Auran eastward to the royal towers
Of great Seleucia built by Grecian kings
Of where the sons of Eden long before
Dwelt in Telassar  In this pleasant soil
His far more pleasant garden God ordained
Out of the fertile ground he caused to grow
All trees of noblest kind for sight smell taste
And all amid them stood the tree of life
High eminent blooming ambrosial fruit
Of vegetable gold and next to life
Our death the tree of knowledge grew fast by
Knowledge of good bought dear by knowing ill
Southward through Eden went a river large
Nor changed his course but through the shaggy hill
Passed underneath ingulfed for God had thrown
That mountain as his gardenmould high raised
Upon the rapid current which through veins
Of porous earth with kindly thirst updrawn
Rose a fresh fountain and with many a rill
Watered the garden thence united fell
Down the steep glade and met the nether flood
Which from his darksome passage now appears
And now divided into four main streams
Runs diverse wandering many a famous realm
And country whereof here needs no account
But rather to tell how if Art could tell
How from that sapphire fount the crisped brooks
Rolling on orient pearl and sands of gold
With mazy errour under pendant shades
Ran nectar visiting each plant and fed
Flowers worthy of Paradise which not nice Art
In beds and curious knots but Nature boon
Poured forth profuse on hill and dale and plain
Both where the morning sun first warmly smote
The open field and where the unpierced shade
Imbrowned the noontide bowers  Thus was this place
A happy rural seat of various view
Groves whose rich trees wept odorous gums and balm
Others whose fruit burnished with golden rind
Hung amiable Hesperian fables true
If true here only and of delicious taste
Betwixt them lawns or level downs and flocks
Grazing the tender herb were interposed
Or palmy hillock or the flowery lap
Of some irriguous valley spread her store
Flowers of all hue and without thorn the rose
Another side umbrageous grots and caves
Of cool recess oer which the mantling vine
Lays forth her purple grape and gently creeps
Luxuriant mean while murmuring waters fall
Down the slope hills dispersed or in a lake
That to the fringed bank with myrtle crowned
Her crystal mirrour holds unite their streams
The birds their quire apply airs vernal airs
Breathing the smell of field and grove attune
The trembling leaves while universal Pan
Knit with the Graces and the Hours in dance
Led on the eternal Spring  Not that fair field
Of Enna where Proserpine gathering flowers
Herself a fairer flower by gloomy Dis
Was gathered which cost Ceres all that pain
To seek her through the world nor that sweet grove
Of Daphne by Orontes and the inspired
Castalian spring might with this Paradise
Of Eden strive nor that Nyseian isle
