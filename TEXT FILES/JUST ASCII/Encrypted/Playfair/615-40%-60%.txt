Jamaica Economy

Overview
    The economy is based on sugar bauxite and tourism In  it suffered a
    setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina
    industry a major source of hard currency earnings Since  an economic
    recovery has been under way In  conditions began to improve for the
    bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices The
    recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and tourism
    sectors In September  Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on
    crops and the electric power system a sharp but temporary setback to the
    economy By October  the economic recovery from the hurricane was
    largely complete and real growth was up about  for  In 
    however growth dropped to  as a result of the US recession lower world
