Disdainfully half smiling thus replied
O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise
Since Satan fell whom folly overthrew
And now returns him from his prison scaped
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
Or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed
So wise he judges it to fly from pain
However and to scape his punishment
So judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath
Which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight
Sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to Hell
Which taught thee yet no better that no pain
Can equal anger infinite provoked
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they
Less hardy to endure?  Courageous Chief
The first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged
To thy deserted host this cause of flight
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive
To which the Fiend thus answered frowning stern
Not that I less endure or shrink from pain
Insulting Angel well thou knowest I stood
Thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid
The blasting vollied thunder made all speed
And seconded thy else not dreaded spear
But still thy words at random as before
Argue thy inexperience what behoves
From hard assays and ill successes past
A faithful leader not to hazard all
Through ways of danger by himself untried
I therefore I alone first undertook
To wing the desolate abyss and spy
This new created world whereof in Hell
Fame is not silent here in hope to find
Better abode and my afflicted Powers
To settle here on earth or in mid air
Though for possession put to try once more
What thou and thy gay legions dare against
Whose easier business were to serve their Lord
High up in Heaven with songs to hymn his throne
And practised distances to cringe not fight
To whom the warriour Angel soon replied
To say and straight unsay pretending first
Wise to fly pain professing next the spy
Argues no leader but a liear traced
Satan and couldst thou faithful add?  O name
O sacred name of faithfulness profaned
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
Army of Fiends fit body to fit head
Was this your discipline and faith engaged
Your military obedience to dissolve
Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?
And thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
Patron of liberty who more than thou
Once fawned and cringed and servily adored
Heavens awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope
To dispossess him and thyself to reign?
But mark what I arreed thee now Avant
Fly neither whence thou fledst  If from this hour
Within these hallowed limits thou appear
Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained
And seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn
The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred
So threatened he but Satan to no threats
Gave heed but waxing more in rage replied
Then when I am thy captive talk of chains
Proud limitary Cherub but ere then
Far heavier load thyself expect to feel
From my prevailing arm though Heavens King
Ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers
Usd to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels
In progress through the road of Heaven starpaved
While thus he spake the angelick squadron bright
Turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns
Their phalanx and began to hem him round
With ported spears as thick as when a field
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
Her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
Sways them the careful plowman doubting stands
Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
Prove chaff  On the other side Satan alarmed
Collecting all his might dilated stood
Like Teneriff or Atlas unremoved
His stature reached the sky and on his crest
Sat Horrour plumed nor wanted in his grasp
What seemed both spear and shield  Now dreadful deeds
Might have ensued nor only Paradise
In this commotion but the starry cope
Of Heaven perhaps or all the elements
At least had gone to wrack disturbed and torn
With violence of this conflict had not soon
The Eternal to prevent such horrid fray
Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales yet seen
Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign
Wherein all things created first he weighed
The pendulous round earth with balanced air
In counterpoise now ponders all events
Battles and realms  In these he put two weights
The sequel each of parting and of fight
The latter quick up flew and kicked the beam
Which Gabriel spying thus bespake the Fiend
Satan I know thy strength and thou knowest mine
Neither our own but given  What folly then
To boast what arms can do? since thine no more
Than Heaven permits nor mine though doubled now
To trample thee as mire  For proof look up
And read thy lot in yon celestial sign
Where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak
If thou resist  The Fiend looked up and knew
His mounted scale aloft  Nor morebut fled
Murmuring and with him fled the shades of night



Book V


Now Morn her rosy steps in the eastern clime
Advancing sowed the earth with orient pearl
When Adam waked so customed for his sleep
Was aerylight from pure digestion bred
And temperate vapours bland which the only sound
Of leaves and fuming rills Auroras fan
Lightly dispersed and the shrill matin song
Of birds on every bough so much the more
His wonder was to find unwakened Eve
With tresses discomposed and glowing cheek
As through unquiet rest  He on his side
Leaning half raised with looks of cordial love
Hung over her enamoured and beheld
Beauty which whether waking or asleep
Shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes
Her hand soft touching whispered thus  Awake
My fairest my espoused my latest found
Heavens last best gift my ever new delight
Awake  The morning shines and the fresh field
Calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring
Our tender plants how blows the citron grove
What drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed
How nature paints her colours how the bee
Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet
Such whispering waked her but with startled eye
On Adam whom embracing thus she spake
O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose
My glory my perfection glad I see
Thy face and morn returned for I this night
Such night till this I never passed have dreamed
If dreamed not as I oft am wont of thee
Works of day past or morrows next design
But of offence and trouble which my mind
Knew never till this irksome night  Methought
Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk
With gentle voice  I thought it thine It said
Why sleepest thou Eve? now is the pleasant time
The cool the silent save where silence yields
To the nightwarbling bird that now awake
Tunes sweetest his lovelaboured song now reigns
Fullorbed the moon and with more pleasing light
Shadowy sets off the face of things in vain
If none regard Heaven wakes with all his eyes
Whom to behold but thee Natures desire?
In whose sight all things joy with ravishment
Attracted by thy beauty still to gaze
I rose as at thy call but found thee not
To find thee I directed then my walk
And on methought alone I passed through ways
That brought me on a sudden to the tree
Of interdicted knowledge fair it seemed
Much fairer to my fancy than by day
And as I wondering looked beside it stood
One shaped and winged like one of those from Heaven
By us oft seen his dewy locks distilled
Ambrosia on that tree he also gazed
And O fair plant said he with fruit surcharged
Deigns none to ease thy load and taste thy sweet
Nor God nor Man?  Is knowledge so despised?
Or envy or what reserve forbids to taste?
Forbid who will none shall from me withhold
Longer thy offered good why else set here?
This said he paused not but with venturous arm
He plucked he tasted me damp horrour chilled
At such bold words vouched with a deed so bold
But he thus overjoyed O fruit divine
Sweet of thyself but much more sweet thus cropt
Forbidden here it seems as only fit
For Gods yet able to make Gods of Men
And why not Gods of Men since good the more
Communicated more abundant grows
The author not impaired but honoured more?
Here happy creature fair angelick Eve
Partake thou also happy though thou art
Happier thou mayest be worthier canst not be
Taste this and be henceforth among the Gods
Thyself a Goddess not to earth confined
But sometimes in the air as we sometimes
Ascend to Heaven by merit thine and see
What life the Gods live there and such live thou
So saying he drew nigh and to me held
Even to my mouth of that same fruit held part
Which he had plucked the pleasant savoury smell
So quickened appetite that I methought
Could not but taste  Forthwith up to the clouds
With him I flew and underneath beheld
The earth outstretched immense a prospect wide
And various  Wondering at my flight and change
To this high exaltation suddenly
My guide was gone and I methought sunk down
And fell asleep but O how glad I waked
To find this but a dream  Thus Eve her night
Related and thus Adam answered sad
Best image of myself and dearer half
The trouble of thy thoughts this night in sleep
Affects me equally nor can I like
This uncouth dream of evil sprung I fear
Yet evil whence? in thee can harbour none
Created pure  But know that in the soul
Are many lesser faculties that serve
Reason as chief among these Fancy next
Her office holds of all external things
Which the five watchful senses represent
She forms imaginations aery shapes
Which Reason joining or disjoining frames
All what we affirm or what deny and call
Our knowledge or opinion then retires
Into her private cell when nature rests
Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes
To imitate her but misjoining shapes
Wild work produces oft and most in dreams
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late
Some such resemblances methinks I find
Of our last evenings talk in this thy dream
But with addition strange yet be not sad
Evil into the mind of God or Man
May come and go so unreproved and leave
No spot or blame behind  Which gives me hope
That what in sleep thou didst abhor to dream
Waking thou never will consent to do
Be not disheartened then nor cloud those looks
That wont to be more cheerful and serene
Than when fair morning first smiles on the world
And let us to our fresh employments rise
Among the groves the fountains and the flowers
That open now their choisest bosomed smells
Reserved from night and kept for thee in store
So cheered he his fair spouse and she was cheered
But silently a gentle tear let fall
From either eye and wiped them with her hair
Two other precious drops that ready stood
Each in their crystal sluice he ere they fell
Kissed as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
And pious awe that feared to have offended
So all was cleared and to the field they haste
But first from under shady arborous roof
Soon as they forth were come to open sight
Of dayspring and the sun who scarce uprisen
With wheels yet hovering oer the oceanbrim
Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray
Discovering in wide landskip all the east
Of Paradise and Edens happy plains
Lowly they bowed adoring and began
Their orisons each morning duly paid
In various style for neither various style
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
Their Maker in fit strains pronounced or sung
Unmeditated such prompt eloquence
Flowed from their lips in prose or numerous verse
More tuneable than needed lute or harp
To add more sweetness and they thus began
These are thy glorious works Parent of good
Almighty  Thine this universal frame
Thus wonderous fair  Thyself how wonderous then
Unspeakable who sitst above these heavens
To us invisible or dimly seen
In these thy lowest works yet these declare
Thy goodness beyond thought and power divine
Speak ye who best can tell ye sons of light
Angels for ye behold him and with songs
And choral symphonies day without night
Circle his throne rejoicing ye in Heaven
On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol
Him first him last him midst and without end
Fairest of stars last in the train of night
If better thou belong not to the dawn
Sure pledge of day that crownest the smiling morn
With thy bright circlet praise him in thy sphere
While day arises that sweet hour of prime
Thou Sun of this great world both eye and soul
Acknowledge him thy greater sound his praise
In thy eternal course both when thou climbest
And when high noon hast gained and when thou fallest
Moon that now meetest the orient sun now flyest
With the fixed Stars fixed in their orb that flies
And ye five other wandering Fires that move
In mystick dance not without song resound
His praise who out of darkness called up light
Air and ye Elements the eldest birth
Of Natures womb that in quaternion run
Perpetual circle multiform and mix
And nourish all things let your ceaseless change
Vary to our great Maker still new praise
Ye Mists and Exhalations that now rise
From hill or steaming lake dusky or gray
Till the sun paint your fleecy skirts with gold
In honour to the worlds great Author rise
Whether to deck with clouds the uncoloured sky
Or wet the thirsty earth with falling showers
Rising or falling still advance his praise
His praise ye Winds that from four quarters blow
Breathe soft or loud and wave your tops ye Pines
With every plant in sign of worship wave
Fountains and ye that warble as ye flow
Melodious murmurs warbling tune his praise
Join voices all ye living Souls  Ye Birds
That singing up to Heavengate ascend
Bear on your wings and in your notes his praUPS
