Moldova Economy

Overview
    Moldova the nexttosmallest of the former Soviet republics in area is the
    most densely inhabited Moldova has a little more than  of the population
    labor force capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union Living
    standards have been below average for the European USSR The country enjoys
    a favorable climate and economic development has been primarily based on
    agriculture featuring fruits vegetables wine and tobacco Industry
    accounts for  of the labor force whereas agriculture employs more than
    onethird Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on the
    former Soviet republics for coal oil gas steel most electronic
    equipment machine tools and major consumer durables such as automobiles
    Its industrial and agricultural products in turn have been exported to the
    other former Soviet republics Moldova has freed prices on most goods and
    has legalized private ownership of property including agricultural land
    Moldovas economic prospects are dimmed by the difficulties of moving toward
    a market economy and the political problems of redefining ties to the other
    former Soviet republics and Romania

Mongolia Economy

Overview
    Mongolias severe climate scattered population and wide expanses of
    unproductive land have constrained economic development Economic activity
    traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock 
    Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world In
    recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet
    support The mining and processing of coal copper molybdenum tin
    tungsten and gold account for a large part of industrial production Timber
    and fishing are also important sectors In  Mongolian leadership is
    struggling with severe economic dislocations mainly attributable to the
    economic crumbling of the USSR by far Mongolias leading trade and
    development partner Moscow almost certainly cut aid in  and the
    dissolution of the USSR at yearend  makes prospects for aid quite bleak
    for  Industry in  has been hit hard by energy shortages mainly
    due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports
    The government is moving away from the Sovietstyle centrally planned
    economy through privatization and price reform
