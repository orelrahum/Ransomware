Martinique Economy

Overview
    The economy is based on sugarcane bananas tourism and light industry

    imported contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
    transfers of aid from France Tourism has become more important than
    agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange The majority of the
    work force is employed in the service sector and in administration In
