"Fallen Cherub to be weak is miserable
Doing or suffering but of this be sure
To do aught good never will be our task
But ever to do ill our sole delight
As being the contrary to his high will
Whom we resist If then his providence
Out of our evil seek to bring forth good
Our labour must be to pervert that end
And out of good still to find means of evil
Which ofttimes may succeed so as perhaps
Shall grieve him if I fail not and disturb
His inmost counsels from their destined aim
But see the angry Victor hath recalled
His ministers of vengeance and pursuit
Back to the gates of Heaven the sulphurous hail
Shot after us in storm oerblown hath laid
The fiery surge that from the precipice
Of Heaven received us falling and the thunder
Winged with red lightning and impetuous rage
Perhaps hath spent his shafts and ceases now
To bellow through the vast and boundless Deep
Let us not slip th occasion whether scorn
Or satiate fury yield it from our Foe
Seest thou yon dreary plain forlorn and wild
The seat of desolation void of light
Save what the glimmering of these livid flames
Casts pale and dreadful? Thither let us tend
From off the tossing of these fiery waves
There rest if any rest can harbour there
And reassembling our afflicted powers
Consult how we may henceforth most offend
Our enemy our own loss how repair
How overcome this dire calamity
What reinforcement we may gain from hope
If not what resolution from despair"
  Thus Satan talking to his nearest mate
With head uplift above the wave and eyes
That sparkling blazed his other parts besides
Prone on the flood extended long and large
Lay floating many a rood in bulk as huge
As whom the fables name of monstrous size
Titanian or Earthborn that warred on Jove
Briareos or Typhon whom the den
By ancient Tarsus held or that seabeast
Leviathan which God of all his works
Created hugest that swim th oceanstream
Him haply slumbering on the Norway foam
The pilot of some small nightfoundered skiff
Deeming some island oft as seamen tell
With fixed anchor in his scaly rind
Moors by his side under the lee while night
Invests the sea and wished morn delays
So stretched out huge in length the Archfiend lay
Chained on the burning lake nor ever thence
Had risen or heaved his head but that the will
And high permission of allruling Heaven
Left him at large to his own dark designs
That with reiterated crimes he might
Heap on himself damnation while he sought
Evil to others and enraged might see
How all his malice served but to bring forth
Infinite goodness grace and mercy shewn
On Man by him seduced but on himself
Treble confusion wrath and vengeance poured
  Forthwith upright he rears from off the pool
His mighty stature on each hand the flames
Driven backward slope their pointing spires androlled
In billows leave i th midst a horrid vale
Then with expanded wings he steers his flight
Aloft incumbent on the dusky air
That felt unusual weight till on dry land
He lightsif it were land that ever burned
With solid as the lake with liquid fire
And such appeared in hue as when the force
Of subterranean wind transprots a hill
Torn from Pelorus or the shattered side
Of thundering Etna whose combustible
And fuelled entrails thence conceiving fire
Sublimed with mineral fury aid the winds
And leave a singed bottom all involved
With stench and smoke Such resting found the sole
Of unblest feet Him followed his next mate
Both glorying to have scaped the Stygian flood
As gods and by their own recovered strength
Not by the sufferance of supernal Power
  "Is this the region this the soil the clime"
Said then the lost Archangel "this the seat
That we must change for Heaven?this mournful gloom
For that celestial light? Be it so since he
Who now is sovereign can dispose and bid
What shall be right farthest from him is best
Whom reason hath equalled force hath made supreme
Above his equals Farewell happy fields
Where joy for ever dwells Hail horrors hail
Infernal world and thou profoundest Hell
Receive thy new possessorone who brings
A mind not to be changed by place or time
The mind is its own place and in itself
Can make a Heaven of Hell a Hell of Heaven
What matter where if I be still the same
And what I should be all but less than he
Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least
We shall be free th Almighty hath not built
Here for his envy will not drive us hence
Here we may reigh secure and in my choice
To reign is worth ambition though in Hell
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends
Th associates and copartners of our loss
Lie thus astonished on th oblivious pool
And call them not to share with us their part
In this unhappy mansion or once more
With rallied arms to try what may be yet
Regained in Heaven or what more lost in Hell?"
  So Satan spake and him Beelzebub
Thus answered"Leader of those armies bright
Which but th Omnipotent none could have foiled
If once they hear that voice their liveliest pledge
Of hope in fears and dangersheard so oft
In worst extremes and on the perilous edge
Of battle when it raged in all assaults
Their surest signalthey will soon resume
New courage and revive though now they lie
Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire
As we erewhile astounded and amazed
No wonder fallen such a pernicious height"
  He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend
Was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield
Ethereal temper massy large and round
Behind him cast The broad circumference
Hung on his shoulders like the moon whose orb
Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views
At evening from the top of Fesole
Or in Valdarno to descry new lands
Rivers or mountains in her spotty globe
His spearto equal which the tallest pine
Hewn on Norwegian hills to be the mast
Of some great ammiral were but a wand
He walked with to support uneasy steps
Over the burning marl not like those steps
On Heavens azure and the torrid clime
Smote on him sore besides vaulted with fire
Nathless he so endured till on the beach
Of that inflamed sea he stood and called
His legionsAngel Forms who lay entranced
Thick as autumnal leaves that strow the brooks
In Vallombrosa where th Etrurian shades
High overarched embower or scattered sedge
Afloat when with fierce winds Orion armed
Hath vexed the RedSea coast whose waves oerthrew
Busiris and his Memphian chivalry
While with perfidious hatred they pursued
The sojourners of Goshen who beheld
From the safe shore their floating carcases
And broken chariotwheels So thick bestrown
Abject and lost lay these covering the flood
Under amazement of their hideous change
He called so loud that all the hollow deep
Of Hell resounded"Princes Potentates
Warriors the Flower of Heavenonce yours now lost
If such astonishment as this can seize
Eternal Spirits Or have ye chosen this place
After the toil of battle to repose
Your wearied virtue for the ease you find
To slumber here as in the vales of Heaven?
Or in this abject posture have ye sworn
To adore the Conqueror who now beholds
Cherub and Seraph rolling in the flood
With scattered arms and ensigns till anon
His swift pursuers from Heavengates discern
Th advantage and descending tread us down
Thus drooping or with linked thunderbolts
Transfix us to the bottom of this gulf?
Awake arise or be for ever fallen"
  They heard and were abashed and up they sprung
Upon the wing as when men wont to watch
On duty sleeping found by whom they dread
Rouse and bestir themselves ere well awake
Nor did they not perceive the evil plight
In which they were or the fierce pains not feel
Yet to their Generals voice they soon obeyed
Innumerable As when the potent rod
Of Amrams son in Egypts evil day
Waved round the coast upcalled a pitchy cloud
Of locusts warping on the eastern wind
That oer the realm of impious Pharaoh hung
Like Night and darkened all the land of Nile
So numberless were those bad Angels seen
Hovering on wing under the cope of Hell
Twixt upper nether and surrounding fires
Till as a signal given th uplifted spear
Of their great Sultan waving to direct
Their course in even balance down they light
On the firm brimstone and fill all the plain
A multitude like which the populous North
Poured never from her frozen loins to pass
Rhene or the Danaw when her barbarous sons
Came like a deluge on the South and spread
Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands
Forthwith form every squadron and each band
The heads and leaders thither haste where stood
Their great Commandergodlike Shapes and Forms
Excelling human princely Dignities
And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones
Though on their names in Heavenly records now
Be no memorial blotted out and rased
By their rebellion from the Books of Life
Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve
Got them new names till wandering oer the earth
Through Gods high sufferance for the trial of man
By falsities and lies the greatest part
Of mankind they corrupted to forsake
God their Creator and th invisible
Glory of him that made them to transform
Oft to the image of a brute adorned
With gay religions full of pomp and gold
And devils to adore for deities
Then were they known to men by various names
And various idols through the heathen world
  Say Muse their names then known who first who last
Roused from the slumber on that fiery couch
At their great Emperors call as next in worth
Came singly where he stood on the bare strand
While the promiscuous crowd stood yet aloof?
  The chief were those who from the pit of Hell
Roaming to seek their prey on Earth durst fix
Their seats long after next the seat of God
Their altars by his altar gods adored
Among the nations round and durst abide
Jehovah thundering out of Sion throned
Between the Cherubim yea often placed
Within his sanctuary itself their shrines
Abominations and with cursed things
His holy rites and solemn feasts profaned
And with their darkness durst affront his light
First Moloch horrid king besmeared with blood
Of human sacrifice and parents tears
Though for the noise of drums and timbrels loud
Their childrens cries unheard that passed through fire
To his grim idol Him the Ammonite
Worshiped in Rabba and her watery plain
In Argob and in Basan to the stream
Of utmost Arnon Nor content with such
Audacious neighbourhood the wisest heart
Of Solomon he led by fraoud to build
His temple right against the temple of God
On that opprobrious hill and made his grove
The pleasant valley of Hinnom Tophet thence
And black Gehenna called the type of Hell
Next Chemos th obscene dread of Moabs sons
From Aroar to Nebo and the wild
Of southmost Abarim in Hesebon
And Horonaim Seons real beyond
The flowery dale of Sibma clad with vines
And Eleale to th Asphaltic Pool
Peor his other name when he enticed
Israel in Sittim on their march from Nile
To do him wanton rites which cost them woe
Yet thence his lustful orgies he enlarged
Even to that hill of scandal by the grove
Of Moloch homicide lust hard by hate
Till good Josiah drove them thence to Hell
With these came they who from the bordering flood
Of old Euphrates to the brook that parts
Egypt from Syrian ground had general names
Of Baalim and Ashtaroththose male
These feminine For Spirits when they please
Can either sex assume or both so soft
And uncompounded is their essence pure
Not tried or manacled with joint or limb
Nor founded on the brittle strength of bones
Like cumbrous flesh but in what shape they choose
Dilated or condensed bright or obscure
Can execute their airy purposes
And works of love or enmity fulfil
For those the race of Israel oft forsook
Their Living Strength and unfrequented left
His righteous altar bowing lowly down
To bestial gods for which their heads as low
Bowed down in battle sunk before the spear
Of despicable foes With these in troop
Came Astoreth whom the Phoenicians called
Astarte queen of heaven with crescent horns
To whose bright image nigntly by the moon
Sidonian virgins paid their vows and songs
In Sion also not unsung where stood
Her temple on th offensive mountain built
By that uxorious king whose heart though large
Beguiled by fair idolatresses fell
To idols foul Thammuz came next behind
Whose annual wound in Lebanon allured
The Syrian damsels to lament his fate
In amorous ditties all a summers day
While smooth Adonis from his native rock
Ran purple to the sea supposed with blood
Of Thammuz yearly wounded the lovetale
Infected Sions daughters with like heat
Whose wanton passions in the sacred proch
Ezekiel saw when by the vision led
His eye surveyed the dark idolatries
Of alienated Judah Next came one
Who mourned in earnest when the captive ark
Maimed his brute image head and hands lopt off
In his own temple on the grunseledge
Where he fell flat and shamed his worshippers
Dagon his name seamonsterupward man
And downward fish yet had his temple high
Reared in Azotus dreaded through the coast
Of Palestine in Gath and Ascalon
And Accaron and Gazas frontier bounds
Him followed Rimmon whose delightful seat
Was fair Damascus on the fertile banks
Of Abbana and Pharphar lucid streams
He also against the house of God was bold
A leper once he lost and gained a king
Ahaz his sottish conqueror whom he drew
Gods altar to disparage and displace
For one of Syrian mode whereon to burn
His odious offerings and adore the gods
Whom he had vanquished After these appeared
A crew who under names of old renown
Osiris Isis Orus and their train
With monstrous shapes and sorceries abused
Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
Rather than human Nor did Israel scape
