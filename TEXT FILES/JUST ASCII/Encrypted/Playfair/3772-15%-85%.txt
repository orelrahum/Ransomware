PETERS the price of copyright in a digital medium whatever solution is
worked out will include managing and assembling the database  She
strongly recommended that publishers and librarians or people with
various backgrounds cooperate to work out administratively feasible
systems in order to produce better results

In the lengthy questionandanswer period that followed PETERSs
presentation the following points emerged

      The Copyright Office maintains that anything mechanical and
     totally exhaustive probably is not protected  In the event that
     what an individual did in developing potentially copyrightable
     material is not understood the Copyright Office will ask about the
     creative choices the applicant chose to make or not to make  As a
     practical matter if one believes she or he has made enough of those
     choices that person has a right to assert a copyright and someone
     else must assert that the work is not copyrightable  The more
     mechanical the more automatic a thing is the less likely it is to
     be copyrightable

      Nearly all photographs are deemed to be copyrightable but no one
     worries about them much because everyone is free to take the same
     image  Thus a photographic copyright represents what is called a
     "thin" copyright  The photograph itself must be duplicated in
     order for copyright to be violated

      The Copyright Office takes the position that Xrays are not
     copyrightable because they are mechanical  It  can be argued
     whether or not image enhancement in scanning can be protected  One
     must exercise care with material created with public funds and
     generally in the public domain  An article written by a federal
     employee if written as part of official duties is not
     copyrightable  However control over a scientific article written
     by a National Institutes of Health grantee ie someone who
     receives money from the US government depends on NIH policy  If
     the government agency has no policy and that policy can be
     contained in its regulations the contract or the grant the
     author retains copyright  If a provision of the contract grant or
     regulation states that there will be no copyright then it does not
     exist  When a work is created copyright automatically comes into
     existence unless something exists that says it does not

      An enhanced electronic copy of a print copy of an older reference
     work in the public domain that does not contain copyrightable new
     material is a purely mechanical rendition of the original work and
     is not copyrightable

      Usually when a work enters the public domain nothing can remove
     it  For example Congress recently passed into law the concept of
     automatic renewal which means that copyright on any work published
     between l and l does not have to be renewed in order to
     receive a seventyfiveyear term  But any work not renewed before
      is in the public domain

      Concerning whether or not the United States keeps track of when
     authors die nothing was ever done nor is anything being done at
     the moment by the Copyright Office

      Software that drives a mechanical process is itself copyrightable
     If one changes platforms the software itself has a copyright  The
     World Intellectual Property Organization will hold a symposium 
     March through  April l at Harvard University on digital
     technology and will study this entire issue  If one purchases a
     computer software package such as MacPaint and creates something
     new one receives protection only for that which has been added

PETERS added that often in copyright matters rough justice is the
outcome for example in collective licensing ASCAP ie American
Society of Composers Authors and Publishers and BMI ie Broadcast
Music Inc where it may seem that the big guys receive more than their
due  Of course people ought not to copy a creative product without
paying for it there should be some compensation  But the truth of the
world and it is not a great truth is that the big guy gets played on
the radio more frequently than the little guy who has to do much more
until he becomes a big guy  That is true of every author every
composer everyone and unfortunately is part of life

Copyright always originates with the author except in cases of works
made for hire  Most software falls into this category  When an author
sends his article to a journal he has not relinquished copyright though
he retains the right to relinquish it  The author receives absolutely
everything  The less prominent the author the more leverage the
publisher will have in contract negotiations  In order to transfer the
rights the author must sign an agreement giving them away

In an electronic society it is important to be able to license a writer
and work out deals  With regard to use of a work it usually is much
easier when a publisher holds the rights  In an electronic era a real
problem arises when one is digitizing and making information available
PETERS referred again to electronic licensing clearinghouses  Copyright
ought to remain with the author but as one moves forward globally in the
electronic arena a middleman who can handle the various rights becomes
increasingly necessary

The notion of copyright law is that it resides with the individual but
in an online environment where a work can be adapted and tinkered with
by many individuals there is concern  If changes are authorized and
there is no agreement to the contrary the person who changes a work owns
the changes  To put it another way the person who acquires permission
to change a work technically will become the author and the owner unless
some agreement to the contrary has been made  It is typical for the
original publisher to try to control all of the versions and all of the
uses  Copyright law always only sets up the boundaries  Anything can be
changed by contract

                                 

SESSION VII  CONCLUSION

the Workshop  Bringing the text and image partisans together 
Desiderata in planning the longterm development of something  Questions
surrounding the issue of electronic deposit  Discussion of electronic
deposit as an allusion to the issue of standards  Need for a directory
of preservation projects in digital form and for access to their
digitized files  CETHs catalogue of machinereadable texts in the
humanities  What constitutes a publication in the electronic world? 
Need for LC to deal with the concept of online publishing  LCs Network
Development Office  exploring the limits of MARC as a standard in terms
of handling electronic information  Magnitude of the problem and the
need for distributed responsibility in order to maintain and store
electronic information  Workshop participants to be viewed as a starting
point  Development of a network version of AM urged  A step toward AMs
