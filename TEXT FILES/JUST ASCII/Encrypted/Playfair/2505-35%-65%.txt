Ascending while the north wind sleeps oerspread
Heavens cheerful face the louring element
Scowls oer the darkened landscape snow or shower
If chance the radiant sun with farewell sweet
Extend his evening beam the fields revive
The birds their notes renew and bleating herds
Attest their joy that hill and valley rings
O shame to men Devil with devil damned
Firm concord holds men only disagree
Of creatures rational though under hope
Of heavenly grace and God proclaiming peace
Yet live in hatred enmity and strife
Among themselves and levy cruel wars
Wasting the earth each other to destroy
As if which might induce us to accord
Man had not hellish foes enow besides
That day and night for his destruction wait
  The Stygian council thus dissolved and forth
In order came the grand infernal Peers
Midst came their mighty Paramount and seemed
Alone th antagonist of Heaven nor less
Than Hells dread Emperor with pomp supreme
And godlike imitated state him round
A globe of fiery Seraphim enclosed
With bright emblazonry and horrent arms
Then of their session ended they bid cry
With trumpets regal sound the great result
Toward the four winds four speedy Cherubim
Put to their mouths the sounding alchemy
By heralds voice explained the hollow Abyss
Heard far adn wide and all the host of Hell
With deafening shout returned them XUIN QNNBKUO
