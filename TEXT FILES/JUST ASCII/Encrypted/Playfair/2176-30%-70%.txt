Uzbekistan Economy

Overview
    Although Uzbekistan accounted for only  of total Soviet output it
    produced twothirds of the USSRs cotton Moscows push for everincreasing
    amounts of cotton included massive irrigation projects which caused

    Furthermore the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive
    pollution and widespread health problems Recently the republic has sought
    to encourage food production at the expense of cotton The small industrial
    sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery mineral
    fertilizers vegetable oil and electrical cranes Uzbekistan also has some
    important natural resources including gold about  of Soviet production
    uranium and natural gas The Uzbek government has encouraged land reform
