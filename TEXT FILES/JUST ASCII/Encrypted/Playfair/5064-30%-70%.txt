Martinique Economy

Overview
    The economy is based on sugarcane bananas tourism and light industry
    Agriculture accounts for about  of GDP and the small industrial sector
    for  Sugar production has declined with most of the sugarcane now used
    for the production of rum Banana exports are increasing going mostly to
    France The bulk of meat vegetable and grain requirements must be
    imported contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
    transfers of aid from France Tourism has become more important than
    agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange The majority of the
    work force is employed in the service sector and in administration In
