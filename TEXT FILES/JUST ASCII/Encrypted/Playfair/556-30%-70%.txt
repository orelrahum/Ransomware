and  Os also are  frequently confused  Double Ms create a particular
problem even on clean pages  They are so wide in most fonts that they
touch and the system simply cannot tell where one letter ends and the
other begins  Complex page formats occasionally fail to columnate
properly which entails rescanning as though one were working with a
single column entering the ASCII and decolumnating for better
searching  With proportionally spaced text OCR can have difficulty
discerning what is a space and what are merely spaces between letters as
opposed to spaces between words and therefore will merge text or break
up words where it should not

ZIDAR said that it can often take longer to edit a poorcopy OCR than to
key it from scratch  NAL has also experimented with partial editing of
text whereby project workers go into and clean up the format removing
stray characters but not runniDF E LHSXVRMQRA  DLF WMWSQRPB ZQZHV HW
