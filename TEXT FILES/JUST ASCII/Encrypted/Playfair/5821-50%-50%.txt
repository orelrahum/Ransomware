In power and excellence but favoured more
Of him who rules above so was his will
Pronounced among the Gods and by an oath
That shook Heavens whole circumference confirmed
Thither let us bend all our thoughts to learn
What creatures there inhabit of what mould
Or substance how endued and what their power
And where their weakness how attempted best
By force of subtlety Though Heaven be shut
And Heavens high Arbitrator sit secure
In his own strength this place may lie exposed
The utmost border of his kingdom left
To their defence who hold it here perhaps
Some advantageous act may be achieved
By sudden onseteither with Hellfire
To waste his whole creation or possess
All as our own and drive as we were driven
The puny habitants or if not drive
Seduce them to our party that their God
May prove their foe and with repenting hand
Abolish his own works This would surpass
Common revenge and interrupt his joy
In our confusion and our joy upraise
In his disturbance when his darling sons
Hurled headlong to partake with us shall curse
Their frail original and faded bliss
Faded so soon Advise if this be worth
Attempting or to sit in darkness here
Hatching vain empires" Thus beelzebub
Pleaded his devilish counselfirst devised
By Satan and in part proposed for whence
But from the author of all ill could spring
So deep a malice to confound the race
Of mankind in one root and Earth with Hell
To mingle and involve done all to spite
The great Creator? But their spite still serves
His glory to augment The bold design
Pleased highly those infernal States and joy
Sparkled in all their eyes with full assent
They vote whereat his speech he thus renews
"Well have ye judged well ended long debate
Synod of Gods and like to what ye are
Great things resolved which from the lowest deep
Will once more lift us up in spite of fate
Nearer our ancient seatperhaps in view
Of those bright confines whence with neighbouring arms
And opportune excursion we may chance
Reenter Heaven or else in some mild zone
Dwell not unvisited of Heavens fair light
Secure and at the brightening orient beam
Purge off this gloom the soft delicious air
To heal the scar of these corrosive fires
Shall breathe her balm But first whom shall RY PSWR
