inability to perform OCR also was a major disappointment  At the time
computer output microfilm was unavailable to test

The equipment used for a scanning system was the last topic addressed by
ZIDAR  The type of equipment that one would purchase for a scanning
system included  a microcomputer at least a  but preferably a 
a large hard disk  megabyte at minimum a multitasking operating
system that allows one to run some things in batch in the background
while scanning or doing text editing for example Unix or OS and
theoretically Windows a highspeed scanner and scanning software that
allows one to make the various adjustments mentioned earlier a
highresolution monitor  dpi  OCR software and hardware to perform
text recognition an optical disk subsystem on which to archive all the
images as the processing is done file management and tracking software

ZIDAR opined that the software one purchases was more important than the
hardware and might also cost more than the hardware but it was likely to
prove critical to the success or failure of ones system  In addition to
a standalone scanning workstation for image capture then text capture
requires one or two editing stations networked to this scanning station
to perform editing  Editing the text takes two or three times as long as
capturing the images

Finally ZIDAR stressed the importance of buying an open system that allows
for more than one vendor complies with standards and can be upgraded

Donald WATERS head of the Systems Office Yale University Library
reported on the progress of a master plan for a project at Yale to
convert microfilm to digital imagery Project Open Book POB  Stating
that POB was in an advanced stage of planning WATERS detailed in
particular the process of selecting a vendor partner and several key
issues under discussion as Yale prepares to move into the project itself
He commented first on the vision that serves as the context of POB and
then described its purpose and scope

WATERS sees the library of the future not necessarily as an electronic
library but as a place that generates preserves and improves for its
clients ready access to both intellectual and physical recorded
knowledge  Electronic tools must find a place in the library in the
context of this vision  Several roles for electronic tools include
serving as  indirect sources of electronic knowledge or as "finding"
aids the online catalogues the articlelevel indices registers for
documents and archives direct sources of recorded knowledge fulltext
images and various kinds of compound sources of recorded knowledge the
socalled compound documents of Hypertext mixed text and image
mixedtext image format and multimedia

POB is looking particularly at images and an image library the uses to
which images will be put eg storage printing browsing and then use
as input for other processes OCR as a subsequent process to image
capture or creating an image library and also possibly generating
microfilm

While input will come from a variety of sources POB is considering
especially input from preservation microfilm  A possible outcome is that
the film and paper which provide the input for the image library
eventually may go off into remote storage and that the image library may
be the primary access tool

The purpose and scope of POB focus on imaging  Though related to CXP
POB has two features which distinguish it   scaleconversion of
 volumes into digital image form and  sourceconversion from
microfilm  Given these features several key working hypotheses guide
POB including   Since POB is using microfilm it is not concerned with
the image library as a preservation medium   Digital imagery can improve
access to recorded knowledge through printing and network distribution at
a modest incremental cost of microfilm   Capturing and storing documents
in a digital image form is necessary to further improvements in access
POB distinguishes between the imaging digitizing process and OCR
which at this stage it does not plan to perform

Currently in its first or organizational phase POB found that it could
use a vendor selection process to facilitate a good deal of the
organizational work eg creating a project team and advisory board
confirming the validity of the plan establishing the cost of the project
and a budget selecting the materials to convert and then raising the
necessary funds

POB developed numerous selection criteria including  a firm committed
to imagedocument management the ability to serve as systems integrator
in a largescale project over several years interest in developing the
requisite software as a standard rather than a custom product and a
willingness to invest substantial resources in the project itself

Two vendors DEC and Xerox were selected as finalists in October 
and with the support of the Commission on Preservation and Access each
was commissioned to generate a detailed requirements analysis for the
project and then to submit a formal proposal for the completion of the
project which included a budget and costs The terms were that POB would
pay the loser  The results for Yale of involving a vendor included
broad involvement of Yale staff across the board at a relatively low
cost which may have longterm significance in carrying out the project
twentyfive to thirty university people are engaged in POB better
understanding of the factors that affect corporate response to markets
for imaging products a competitive proposal and a more sophisticated
view of the imaging markets

The most important factor that distinguished the vendors under
consideration was their identification with the customer  The size and
internal complexity of the company also was an important factor  POB was
looking at large companies that had substantial resources  In the end
the process generated for Yale two competitive proposals with Xeroxs
the clear winner  WATERS then described the components of the proposal
the design principles and some of the costs estimated for the process

Components are essentially four  a conversion subsystem a
networkaccessible storage subsystem for  books and POB expects
 to  dpi storage browsing stations distributed on the campus
network and network access to the image printers

Among the design principles POB wanted conversion at the highest
possible resolution  Assuming TIFF files TIFF files with Group 
compression TCPIP and ethernet network on campus POB wanted a
clientserver approach with image documents distributed to the
workstations and made accessible through native workstation interfaces
such as Windows  POB also insisted on a phased approach to
implementation   a standalone singleuser lowcost entry into the
business with a workstation focused on conversion and allowing POB to
explore user access  movement into a highervolume conversion with
networkaccessible storage and multiple access stations and  a
highvolume conversion fullcapacity storage and multiple browsing
stations distributed throughout the campus

The costs proposed for startup assumed the existence of the Yale network
and its two DocuTech image printers  Other startup costs are estimated
at  million over the three phases  At the end of the project the annual
operating costs estimated primarily for the software and hardware proposed
come to about  but these exclude costs for labor needed in the
conversion process network and printer usage and facilities management

Finally the selection process produced for Yale a more sophisticated
view of the imaging markets  the management of complex documents in
image form is not a preservation problem not a library problem but a
general problem in a broad general industry  Preservation materials are
useful for developing that market because of the qualities of the
material  For example much of it is out of copyright  The resolution
of key issues such as the quality of scanning and image browsing also
will affect development of that market

The technology is readily available but changing rapidly  In this
context of rapid change several factors affect quality and cost to
which POB intends to pay particular attention for example the various
levels of resolution that can be achieved  POB believes it can bring
resolution up to  dpi but an interpolation process from  to  is
more likely  The variation quality in microfilm will prove to be a
highly important factor  POB may reexamine the standards used to film in
the first place by looking at this process as a followon to microfilming

Other important factors include  the techniques available to the
operator for handling material the ways of integrating quality control
into the digitizing work flow and a work flow that includes indexing and
storage  POBs requirement was to be able to deal with quality control
at the point of scanning  Thus thanks to Xerox POB anticipates having
a mechanism which will allow it not only to scan in batch form but to
review the material as it goes through the scanner and control quality
from the outset

The standards for measuring quality and costs depend greatly on the uses
of the material including subsequent OCR storage printing and
browsing  But especially at issue for POB is the facility for browsing
This facility WATERS said is perhaps the weakest aspect of imaging
technology and the most in need of development

A variety of factors affect the usability of complex documents in image
form among them   the ability of the system to handle the full range
of document types not just monographs but serials multipart
monographs and manuscripts  the location of the database of record
for bibliographic information about the image document which POB wants
to enter once and in the most useful place the online catalog  a
document identifier for referencing the bibliographic information in one
place and the images in another  the technique for making the basic
internal structure of the document accessible to the reader and finally
 the physical presentation on the CRT of those documents  POB is ready
to complete this phase now  One last decision involves deciding which
material to scan

                                 


DISCUSSION  TIFF files constitute de facto standard  NARAs experience
with image conversion software and text conversion  RFC  
Considerable flux concerning available hardware and software solutions 
NAL throughput rate during scanning  Window management questions 


In the questionandanswer period that followed WATERSs presentation
the following points emerged

      ZIDARs statement about using TIFF files as a standard meant de
     facto standard  This is what most people use and typically exchange
     with other groups across platforms or even occasionally across
     display software

      HOLMES commented on the unsuccessful experience of NARA in
     attempting to run imageconversion software or to exchange between
     applications  What are supposedly TIFF files go into other software
     that is supposed to be able to accept TIFF but cannot recognize the
     format and cannot deal with it and thus renders the exchange
     useless  Re text conversion he noted the different recognition
     rates obtained by substituting the make and model of scanners in
     NARAs recent test of an "intelligent" characterrecognition product
     for a new company  In the selection of hardware and software
     HOLMES argued software no longer constitutes the overriding factor
     it did until about a year ago rather it is perhaps important to
     look at both now

      Danny Cohen and Alan Katz of the University of Southern California
     Information Sciences Institute began circulating as an Internet RFC
     RFC  about a month ago a standard for a TIFF interchange
     format for Internet distribution of monochrome bitmapped images
     which LYNCH said he believed would be used as a de facto standard

      FLEISCHHAUERs impression from hearing these reports and thinking
     about AMs experience was that there is considerable flux concerning
     available hardware and software solutions  HOOTON agreed and
     commented at the same time on ZIDARs statement that the equipment
     employed affects the results produced  One cannot draw a complete
     conclusion by saying it is difficult or impossible to perform OCR
     from scanning microfilm for example with that device  that set of
     parameters and system requirements because numerous other people
     are accomplishing just that using other components perhaps
     HOOTON opined that both the hardware and the software were highly
     important  Most of the problems discussed today have been solved in
     numerous different ways by other people  Though it is good to be
     cognizant of various experiences this is not to say that it will
     always be thus

      At NAL the throughput rate of the scanning process for paper
     page by page performing OCR ranges from  to  pages per day
     not performing OCR is considerably faster although how much faster
     is not known  This is for scanning from bound books which is much
     slower

      WATERS commented on window management questions  DEC proposed an
     XWindows solution which was problematical for two reasons  One was
     POBs requirement to be able to manipulate images on the workstation
     and bring them down to the workstation itself and the other was
     network usage

                                 


THOMA  Illustration of deficiencies in scanning and storage process 
Image quality in this process  Different costs entailed by better image
quality  Techniques for overcoming various deficiencies  fixed
thresholding dynamic thresholding dithering image merge  Page edge
effects 


George THOMA chief Communications Engineering Branch National Library
of Medicine NLM illustrated several of the deficiencies discussed by
the previous speakers  He introduced the topic of special problems by
noting the advantages of electronic imaging  For example it is regenerable
because it is a coded file and realtime quality control is possible with
electronic capture whereas in photographic capture it is not

One of the difficulties discussed in the scanning and storage process was
image quality which without belaboring the obvious means different
things for maps medical Xrays or broadcast television  In the case of
documents THOMA said image quality boils down to legibility of the
textual parts and fidelity in the case of gray or color photo printtype
material  Legibility boils down to scan density the standard in most
cases being  dpi  Increasing the resolution with scanners that
perform  or  dpi however comes at a cost

Better image quality entails at least four different kinds of costs  
equipment costs because the CCD ie chargecouple device with
greater number of elements costs more   time costs that translate to
the actual capture costs because manual labor is involved the time is
also dependent on the fact that more data has to be moved around in the
machine in the scanning or network devices that perform the scanning as
well as the storage   media costs because at high resolutions larger
files have to be stored and  transmission costs because there is just
more data to be transmitted

But while resolution takes care of the issue of legibility in image
quality other deficiencies have to do with contrast and elements on the
page scanned or the image that needed to be removed or clarified  Thus
THOMA proceeded to illustrate various deficiencies how they are
manifested and several techniques to overcome them

Fixed thresholding was the first technique described suitable for
blackandwhite text when the contrast does not vary over the page  One
can have many different threshold levels in scanning devices  Thus
THOMA offered an example of extremely poor contrast which resulted from
the fact that the stock was a heavy red  This is the sort of image that
when microfilmed fails to provide any legibility whatsoever  Fixed
thresholding is the way to change the blacktored contrast to the
desired blacktowhite contrast

Other examples included material that had been browned or yellowed by
age  This was also a case of contrast deficiency and correction was
done by fixed thresholding  A final example boils down to the same
thing slight variability but it is not significant  Fixed thresholding
solves this problem as well  The microfilm equivalent is certainly legible
but it comes with dark areas  Though THOMA did not have a slide of the
microfilm in this case he did show the reproduced electronic image

When one has variable contrast over a page or the lighting over the page
area varies especially in the case where a bound volume has light
shining on it the image must be processed by a dynamic thresholding
scheme  One scheme dynamic averaging allows the threshold level not to
be fixed but to be recomputed for every pixel from the neighboring
characteristics  The neighbors of a pixel determine where the threshold
should be set for that pixel

THOMA showed an example of a page that had been made deficient by a
variety of techniques including a burn mark coffee stains and a yellow
marker  Application of a fixedthresholding scheme THOMA argued might
take care of several deficiencies on the page but not all of them
Performing the calculation for a dynamic threshold setting however
removes most of the deficiencies so that at least the text is legible

Another problem is representing a gray level with blackandwhite pixels
by a process known as dithering or electronic screening  But dithering
does not provide good image quality for pure blackandwhite textual
material  THOMA illustrated this point with examples Although its
suitability for photoprint is the reason for electronic screening or
dithering it cannot be used for every compound image  In the document
that was distributed by CXP THOMA noticed that the dithered image of the
IEEE test chart evinced some deterioration in the text  He presented an
extreme example of deterioration in the text in which compounded
documents had to be set right by other techniques  The technique
illustrated by the present example was an image merge in which the page
is scanned twice and the settings go from fixed threshold to the
dithering matrix the resulting images are merged to give the best
results with each technique

THOMA illustrated how dithering is also used in nonphotographic or
nonprint materials with an example of a grayish page from a medical text
which was reproduced to show all of the gray that appeared in the
original  Dithering provided a reproduction of all the gray in the
original of another example from the same text

THOMA finally illustrated the problem of bordering or pageedge
effects  Books and bound volumes that are placed on a photocopy machine
or a scanner produce pageedge effects that are undesirable for two
reasons   the aesthetics of the image after all if the image is to
be preserved one does not necessarily want to keep all of its
deficiencies  compression with the bordering problem THOMA
illustrated the compression ratio deteriorated tremendously  One way
to eliminate this more serious problem is to have the operator at the
point of scanning window the part of the image that is desirable and
automatically turn all of the pixels out of that picture to white

                                 


FLEISCHHAUER  AMs experience with scanning bound materials  Dithering



Carl FLEISCHHAUER coordinator American Memory Library of Congress
reported AMs experience with scanning bound materials which he likened
to the problems involved in using photocopying machines  Very few
devices in the industry offer bookedge scanning let alone book cradles
The problem may be unsolvable FLEISCHHAUER said because a large enough
market does not exist for a preservationquality scanner  AM is using a
Kurzweil scanner which is a bookedge scanner now sold by Xerox

Devoting the remainder of his brief presentation to dithering
FLEISCHHAUER related AMs experience with a contractor who was using
unsophisticated equipment and software to reduce moire patterns from
printed halftones  AM took the same image and used the dithering
algorithm that forms part of the same Kurzweil Xerox scanner it
disguised moire patterns much more effectively

FLEISCHHAUER also observed that dithering produces a binary file which is
useful for numerous purposes for example printing it on a laser printer
without having to "rehalftone" it  But it tends to defeat efficient
compression because the very thing that dithers to reduce moire patterns
also tends to work against compression schemes  AM thought the
difference in image quality was worth it

                                 


DISCUSSION  Relative use as a criterion for POBs selection of books to
be converted into digital form 


During the discussion period WATERS noted that one of the criteria for
selecting books among the  to be converted into digital image form
would be how much relative use they would receivea subject still
requiring evaluation  The challenge will be to understand whether
coherent bodies of material will increase usage or whether POB should
seek material that is being used scan that and make it more accessible
POB might decide to digitize materials that are already heavily used in
order to make them more accessible and decrease wear on them  Another
approach would be to provide a large body of intellectually coherent
material that may be used more in digital form than it is currently used
in microfilm  POB would seek material that was out of copyright

                                 


BARONAS  Origin and scope of AIIM  Types of documents produced in
AIIMs standards program  Domain of AIIMs standardization work  AIIMs
structure  TC  and MS  Electronic image management standards 
Categories of EIM standardization where AIIM standards are being
developed 


Jean BARONAS senior manager Department of Standards and Technology
Association for Information and Image Management AIIM described the
notforprofit association and the national and international programs
for standardization in which AIIM is active

Accredited for twentyfive years as the nations standards development
organization for document image management AIIM began life in a library
community developing microfilm standards  Today the association
maintains both its library and businessimage management standardization
activitiesand has moved into electronic imagemanagement
standardization EIM

BARONAS defined the programs scope  AIIM deals with   the
terminology of standards and of the technology it uses  methods of
measurement for the systems as well as quality  methodologies for
users to evaluate and measure quality  the features of apparatus used
to manage and edit images and  the procedures used to manage images

BARONAS noted that three types of documents are produced in the AIIM
standards program  the first two accredited by the American National
Standards Institute ANSI are standards and standard recommended
practices  Recommended practices differ from standards in that they
contain more tutorial information  A technical report is not an ANSI
standard  Because AIIMs policies and procedures for developing
standards are approved by ANSI its standards are labeled ANSIAIIM
followed by the number and title of the standard

BARONAS then illustrated the domain of AIIMs standardization work  For
example AIIM is the administrator of the US Technical Advisory Group
TAG to the International Standards Organizations ISO technical
committee TC ll Micrographics and Optical Memories for Document and
Image Recording Storage and Use  AIIM officially works through ANSI in
the international standardization process

BARONAS described AIIMs structure including its board of directors its
standards board of twelve individuals active in the imagemanagement
industry its strategic planning and legal admissibility task forces and
its National Standards Council which is comprised of the members of a
number of organizations who vote on every AIIM standard before it is
published  BARONAS pointed out that AIIMs liaisons deal with numerous
other standards developers including the optical disk community office
and publishing systems imagecodesandcharacter set committees and the
National Information Standards Organization NISO

BARONAS illustrated the procedures of TC ll which covers all aspects of
image management  When AIIMs national program has conceptualized a new
project it is usually submitted to the international level so that the
member countries of TC ll can simultaneously work on the development of
the standard or the technical report  BARONAS also illustrated a classic
microfilm standard MS which deals with numerous imaging concepts that
apply to electronic imaging  Originally developed in the ls revised
in the ls and revised again in l this standard is scheduled for
another revision  MS is an active standard whereby users may propose
new density ranges and new methods of evaluating film images in the
standards revision

BARONAS detailed several electronic imagemanagement standards for
instance ANSIAIIM MS a qualitycontrol guideline for scanning "
by " blackandwhite office documents  This standard is used with the
IEEE fax imagea continuous tone photographic image with gray scales
text and several continuous tone picturesand AIIM test target number
 a representative document used in office document management

BARONAS next outlined the four categories of EIM standardization in which
AIIM standards are being developed  transfer and retrieval evaluation
optical disc and document scanning applications and design and
conversion of documents  She detailed several of the main projects of
each   in the category of image transfer and retrieval a bilevel
image transfer format ANSIAIIM MS which is a proposed standard that
describes a file header for image transfer between unlike systems when
the images are compressed using G and G compression  the category of
image evaluation which includes the AIIMproposed TR tutorial on image
resolution this technical report will treat the differences and
similarities between classical or photographic and electronic imaging
 design and conversion which includes a proposed technical report
called "Forms Design Optimization for EIM" this report considers how
generalpurpose business forms can be best designed so that scanning is
optimized reprographic characteristics such as type rules background
tint and color will likewise be treated in the technical report 
disk and document scanning applications includes a project a on planning
platters and disk management b on generating an application profile for
EIM when images are stored and distributed on CDROM and c on
evaluating SCSI and how a common command set can be generated for SCSI
so that document scanners are more easily integrated  ANSIAIIM MS
will also apply to compressed images

                                 


BATTIN  The implications of standards for preservation  A major
obstacle to successful cooperation  A hindrance to access in the digital
environment  Standards a doubleedged sword for those concerned with the
preservation of the human record  Nearterm prognosis for reliable
archival standards  Preservation concerns for electronic media  Need
for reconceptualizing our preservation principles  Standards in the real
world and the politics of reproduction  Need to redefine the concept of
archival and to begin to think in terms of life cycles  Cooperation and
the La Guardia Eight  Concerns generated by discussions on the problems
of preserving text and image  General principles to be adopted in a
world without standards 


Patricia BATTIN president the Commission on Preservation and Access
CPA addressed the implications of standards for preservation  She
listed several areas where the library profession and the analog world of
the printed book had made enormous contributions over the past hundred
yearsfor example in bibliographic formats binding standards and most
important in determining what constitutes longevity or archival quality

Although standards have lightened the preservation burden through the
development of national and international collaborative programs
nevertheless a pervasive mistrust of other peoples standards remains a
major obstacle to successful cooperation BATTIN said

The zeal to achieve perfection regardless of the cost has hindered
rather than facilitated access in some instances and in the digital
environment where no real standards exist has brought an ironically
just reward

BATTIN argued that standards are a doubleedged sword for those concerned
with the preservation of the human record that is the provision of
access to recorded knowledge in a multitude of media as far into the
future as possible  Standards are essential to facilitate
interconnectivity and access but BATTIN said as LYNCH pointed out
yesterday if set too soon they can hinder creativity expansion of
capability and the broadening of access  The characteristics of
standards for digital imagery differ radically from those for analog
imagery  And the nature of digital technology implies continuing
volatility and change  To reiterate precipitous standardsetting can
inhibit creativity but delayed standardsetting results in chaos

Since in BATTINS opinion the nearterm prognosis for reliable archival
standards as defined by librarians in the analog world is poor two
alternatives remain  standing pat with the old technology or
reconceptualizing

Preservation concerns for electronic media fall into two general domains
One is the continuing assurance of access to knowledge originally
generated stored disseminated and used in electronic form  This
domain contains several subdivisions including  the closed
proprietary systems discussed the previous day bundled information such
as electronic journals and government agency records and electronically
produced or captured raw data and  the application of digital
technologies to the reformatting of materials originally published on a
deteriorating analog medium such as acid paper or videotape

The preservation of electronic media requires a reconceptualizing of our
preservation principles during a volatile standardless transition which
may last far longer than any of us envision today  BATTIN urged the
necessity of shifting focus from assessing measuring and setting
standards for the permanence of the medium to the concept of managing
continuing access to information stored on a variety of media and
requiring a variety of everchanging hardware and software for accessa
fundamental shift for the library profession

BATTIN offered a primer on how to move forward with reasonable confidence
in a world without standards  Her comments fell roughly into two sections
 standards in the real world and  the politics of reproduction

In regard to realworld standards BATTIN argued the need to redefine the
concept of archive and to begin to think in terms of life cycles  In
the past the naive assumption that paper would last forever produced a
cavalier attitude toward life cycles  The transient nature of the
electronic media has compelled people to recognize and accept upfront the
concept of life cycles in place of permanency

Digital standards have to be developed and set in a cooperative context
to ensure efficient exchange of information  Moreover during this
transition period greater flexibility concerning how concepts such as
backup copies and archival copies in the CXP are defined is necessary
or the opportunity to move forward will be lost

In terms of cooperation particularly in the university setting BATTIN
also argued the need to avoid going off in a hundred different
directions  The CPA has catalyzed a small group of universities called
the La Guardia Eightbecause La Guardia Airport is where meetings take
placeHarvard Yale Cornell Princeton Penn State Tennessee
Stanford and USC to develop a digital preservation consortium to look
at all these issues and develop de facto standards as we move along
instead of waiting for something that is officially blessed  Continuing
to apply analog values and definitions of standards to the digital
environment BATTIN said will effectively lead to forfeiture of the
benefits of digital technology to research and scholarship

Under the second rubric the politics of reproduction BATTIN reiterated
an oftmade argument concerning the electronic library namely that it
is more difficult to transform than to create and nowhere is that belief
expressed more dramatically than in the conversion of brittle books to
new media  Preserving information published in electronic media involves
making sure the information remains accessible and that digital
information is not lost through reproduction  In the analog world of
photocopies and microfilm the issue of fidelity to the original becomes
paramount as do issues of "Whose fidelity?" and "Whose original?"

BATTIN elaborated these arguments with a few examples from a recent study
conducted by the CPA on the problems of preserving text and image
Discussions with scholars librarians and curators in a variety of
disciplines dependent on text and image generated a variety of concerns
for example   Copy what is not what the technology is capable of
This is very important for the history of ideas  Scholars wish to know
what the author saw and worked from  And make available at the
workstation the opportunity to erase all the defects and enhance the
presentation   The fidelity of reproductionwhat is good enough what
can we afford and the difference it makesissues of subjective versus
objective resolution   The differences between primary and secondary
users  Restricting the definition of primary user to the one in whose
discipline the material has been published runs one headlong into the
reality that these printed books have had a host of other users from a
host of other disciplines who not only were looking for very different
things but who also shared values very different from those of the
primary user   The relationship of the standard of reproduction to new
capabilities of scholarshipthe browsing standard versus an archival
standard  How good must the archival standard be?  Can a distinction be
drawn between potential users in setting standards for reproduction?
Archival storage use copies browsing copiesought an attempt to set
standards even be made?   Finally costs  How much are we prepared to
pay to capture absolute fidelity?  What are the tradeoffs between vastly
enhanced access degrees of fidelity and costs?

These standards BATTIN concluded serve to complicate further the
reproduction process and add to the long list of technical standards
that are necessary to ensure widespread access  Ways to articulate and
analyze the costs that are attached to the different levels of standards
must be found

Given the chaos concerning standards which promises to linger for the
foreseeable future BATTIN urged adoption of the following general
principles

      Strive to understand the changing information requirements of
     scholarly disciplines as more and more technology is integrated into
     the process of research and scholarly communication in order to meet
     future scholarly needs not to build for the past  Capture
     deteriorating information at the highest affordable resolution even
     though the dissemination and display technologies will lag

      Develop cooperative mechanisms to foster agreement on protocols
     for document structure and other interchange mechanisms necessary
     for widespread dissemination and use before official standards are
     set

      Accept that in a transition period de facto standards will have
     to be developed

      Capture information in a way that keeps all options open and
     provides for total convertibility  OCR scanning of microfilm
     producing microfilm from scanned documents etc

      Work closely with the generators of information and the builders
     of networks and databases to ensure that continuing accessibility is
     a primary concern from the beginning

      Piggyback on standards under development for the broad market and
     avoid libraryspecific standards work with the vendors in order to
     take advantage of that which is being standardized for the rest of
     the world

      Concentrate efforts on managing permanence in the digital world
     rather than perfecting the longevity of a particular medium

                                 


DISCUSSION  Additional comments on TIFF 


During the brief discussion period that followed BATTINs presentation
BARONAS explained that TIFF was not developed in collaboration with or
under the auspices of AIIM  TIFF is a company product not a standard
is owned by two corporations and is always changing  BARONAS also

HOOTON  Several questions to be considered in discussing text conversion



HOOTON introduced the final topic text conversion by noting that it is
becoming an increasingly important part of the imaging business  Many
people now realize that it enhances their system to be able to have more
and more character data as part of their imaging system  Re the issue of
OCR versus rekeying HOOTON posed several questions  How does one get
text into computerreadable form?  Does one use automated processes?
Does one attempt to eliminate the use of operators where possible?
Standards for accuracy he said are extremely important  it makes a
major difference in cost and time whether one sets as a standard 
percent acceptance or  percent  He mentioned outsourcing as a
possibility for converting text  Finally what one does with the image
to prepare it for the recognition process is also important he said
because such preparation changes how recognition is viewed as well as
facilitates recognition itself

                                 


LESK  Roles of participants in CORE  Data flow  The scanning process 
The image interface  Results of experiments involving the use of
electronic resources and traditional paper copies  Testing the issue of
serendipity  Conclusions 


Michael LESK executive director Computer Science Research Bell
Communications Research Inc Bellcore discussed the Chemical Online
Retrieval Experiment CORE a cooperative project involving Cornell
University OCLC Bellcore and the American Chemical Society ACS

LESK spoke on  how the scanning was performed including the unusual
feature of page segmentation and  the use made of the text and the
image in experiments

Working with the chemistry journals because ACS has been saving its
typesetting tapes since the mids and thus has a significant backrun
of the most important chemistry journals in the United States CORE is
attempting to create an automated chemical library  Approximately a
quarter of the pages by square inch are made up of images of
quasipictorial material dealing with the graphic components of the
pages is extremely important  LESK described the roles of participants
in CORE   ACS provides copyright permission journals on paper
journals on microfilm and some of the definitions of the files  at
Bellcore LESK chiefly performs the data preparation while Dennis Egan
performs experiments on the users of chemical abstracts and supplies the
indexing and numerous magnetic tapes   Cornell provides the site of the
experiment  OCLC develops retrieval software and other user interfaces
Various manufacturers and publishers have furnished other help

Concerning data flow Bellcore receives microfilm and paper from ACS the
microfilm is scanned by outside vendors while the paper is scanned
inhouse on an Improvision scanner twenty pages per minute at  dpi
which provides sufficient quality for all practical uses  LESK would
prefer to have more gray level because one of the ACS journals prints on
some colored pages which creates a problem

Bellcore performs all this scanning creates a pageimage file and also
selects from the pages the graphics to mix with the text file which is
discussed later in the Workshop  The user is always searching the ASCII
file but she or he may see a display based on the ASCII or a display
based on the images

LESK illustrated how the program performs page analysis and the image
interface  The user types several words is presented with a list
usually of the titles of articles contained in an issuethat derives
from the ASCII clicks on an icon and receives an image that mirrors an
ACS page  LESK also illustrated an alternative interface based on text
on the ASCII the socalled SuperBook interface from Bellcore

LESK next presented the results of an experiment conducted by Dennis Egan
and involving thirtysix students at Cornell one third of them
undergraduate chemistry majors one third senior undergraduate chemistry
majors and one third graduate chemistry students  A third of them
received the paper journals the traditional paper copies and chemical
abstracts on paper  A third received image displays of the pictures of
the pages and a third received the text display with popup graphics

The students were given several questions made up by some chemistry
professors  The questions fell into five classes ranging from very easy
to very difficult and included questions designed to simulate browsing
as well as a traditional information retrievaltype task

LESK furnished the following results  In the straightforward question
searchthe question being what is the phosphorus oxygen bond distance
and hydroxy phosphate?the students were told that they could take
fifteen minutes and then if they wished give up  The students with
paper took more than fifteen minutes on average and yet most of them
gave up  The students with either electronic format text or image
received good scores in reasonable time hardly ever had to give up and
usually found the right answer

In the browsing study the students were given a list of eight topics
told to imagine that an issue of the Journal of the American Chemical
Society had just appeared on their desks and were also told to flip
through it and to find topics mentioned in the issue  The average scores
were about the same  The students were told to answer yes or no about
whether or not particular topics appeared  The errors however were
quite different  The students with paper rarely said that something
appeared when it had not  But they often failed to find something
actually mentioned in the issue  The computer people found numerous
things but they also frequently said that a topic was mentioned when it
was not  The reason of course was that they were performing word
searches  They were finding that words were mentioned and they were
concluding that they had accomplished their task

This question also contained a trick to test the issue of serendipity
The students were given another list of eight topics and instructed
without taking a second look at the journal to recall how many of this
new list of eight topics were in this particular issue  This was an
attempt to see if they performed better at remembering what they were not
looking for  They all performed about the same paper or electronics
about  percent accurate  In short LESK said people were not very
good when it came to serendipity but they were no worse at it with
computers than they were with paper

LESK gave a parenthetical illustration of the learning curve of students
who used SuperBook

The students using the electronic systems started off worse than the ones
using print but by the third of the three sessions in the series had
caught up to print  As one might expect electronics provide a much
better means of finding what one wants to read reading speeds once the
object of the search has been found are about the same

Almost none of the students could perform the hard taskthe analogous
transformation  It would require the expertise of organic chemists to
complete  But an interesting result was that the students using the text
search performed terribly while those using the image system did best
That the text search system is driven by text offers the explanation
Everything is focused on the text to see the pictures one must press
on an icon  Many students found the right article containing the answer
to the question but they did not click on the icon to bring up the right
figure and see it  They did not know that they had found the right place
and thus got it wrong

The short answer demonstrated by this experiment was that in the event
one does not know what to read one needs the electronic systems the
electronic systems hold no advantage at the moment if one knows what to
read but neither do they impose a penalty

LESK concluded by commenting that on one hand the image system was easy
to use  On the other hand the text display system which represented
twenty manyears of work in programming and polishing was not winning
because the text was not being read just searched  The much easier
system is highly competitive as well as remarkably effective for the
actual chemists

                                 


ERWAY  Most challenging aspect of working on AM  Assumptions guiding
AMs approach  Testing different types of service bureaus  AMs
requirement for  percent accuracy  Requirements for textcoding 
Additional factors influencing AMs approach to coding  Results of AMs
experience with rekeying  Other problems in dealing with service bureaus
 Quality control the most timeconsuming aspect of contracting out
conversion  Longterm outlook uncertain 


To Ricky ERWAY associate coordinator American Memory Library of
Congress the constant variety of conversion projects taking place
simultaneously represented perhaps the most challenging aspect of working
on AM  Thus the challenge was not to find a solution for text
conversion but a tool kit of solutions to apply to LCs varied
collections that need to be converted  ERWAY limited her remarks to the
process of converting text to machinereadable form and the variety of
LCs text collections for example bound volumes microfilm and
handwritten manuscripts

Two assumptions have guided AMs approach ERWAY said   A desire not
to perform the conversion inhouse  Because of the variety of formats and
types of texts to capitalize the equipment and have the talents and
skills to operate them at LC would be extremely expensive  Further the
natural inclination to upgrade to newer and better equipment each year
made it reasonable for AM to focus on what it did best and seek external
conversion services  Using service bureaus also allowed AM to have
several types of operations take place at the same time   AM was not a
technology project but an effort to improve access to library
collections  Hence whether text was converted using OCR or rekeying
mattered little to AM  What mattered were cost and accuracy of results

AM considered different types of service bureaus and selected three to
perform several small tests in order to acquire a sense of the field
The sample collections with which they worked included handwritten
correspondence typewritten manuscripts from the s and
eighteenthcentury printed broadsides on microfilm  On none of these
samples was OCR performed they were all rekeyed  AM had several special
requirements for the three service bureaus it had engaged  For instance
any errors in the original text were to be retained  Working from bound
volumes or anything that could not be sheetfed also constituted a factor
eliminating companies that would have performed OCR

AM requires  percent accuracy which though it sounds high often
means one or two errors per page  The initial batch of test samples
contained several handwritten materials for which AM did not require
textcoding  The results ERWAY reported were in all cases fairly
comparable  for the most part all three service bureaus achieved 
percent accuracy  AM was satisfied with the work but surprised at the cost

As AM began converting whole collections it retained the requirement for
 percent accuracy and added requirements for textcoding  AM needed
to begin performing work more than three years ago before LC requirements
for SGML applications had been established  Since AMs goal was simply
to retain any of the intellectual content represented by the formatting
of the document which would be lost if one performed a straight ASCII
conversion AM used "SGMLlike" codes  These codes resembled SGML tags
but were used without the benefit of documenttype definitions  AM found
that many service bureaus were not yet SGMLproficient

Additional factors influencing the approach AM took with respect to
coding included   the inability of any known microcomputerbased
userretrieval software to take advantage of SGML coding and  the
multiple inconsistencies in format of the older documents which
confirmed AM in its desire not to attempt to force the different formats
to conform to a single documenttype definition DTD and thus create the
need for a separate DTD for each document

The five text collections that AM has converted or is in the process of
converting include a collection of eighteenthcentury broadsides a
collection of pamphlets two typescript document collections and a
collection of  books

ERWAY next reviewed the results of AMs experience with rekeying noting
again that because the bulk of AMs materials are historical the quality
of the text often does not lend itself to OCR  While nonEnglish
speakers are less likely to guess or elaborate or correct typos in the
original text they are also less able to infer what we would they also
are nearly incapable of converting handwritten text  Another
disadvantage of working with overseas keyers is that they are much less
likely to telephone with questions especially on the coding with the
result that they develop their own rules as they encounter new
situations

Government contracting procedures and time frames posed a major challenge
to performing the conversion  Many service bureaus are not accustomed to
retaining the image even if they perform OCR  Thus questions of image
format and storage media were somewhat novel to many of them  ERWAY also
remarked other problems in dealing with service bureaus for example
their inability to perform text conversion from the kind of microfilm
that LC uses for preservation purposes

But quality control in ERWAYs experience was the most timeconsuming
aspect of contracting out conversion  AM has been attempting to perform
a percent quality review looking at either every tenth document or
every tenth page to make certain that the service bureaus are maintaining
 percent accuracy  But even if they are complying with the
requirement for accuracy finding errors produces a desire to correct
them and in turn to clean up the whole collection which defeats the
purpose to some extent  Even a double entry requires a
characterbycharacter comparison to the original to meet the accuracy
requirement  LC is not accustomed to publish imperfect texts which
makes attempting to deal with the industry standard an emotionally
fraught issue for AM  As was mentioned in the previous days discussion
going from  to  percent accuracy usually doubles costs and
means a third keying or another complete runthrough of the text

Although AM has learned much from its experiences with various collections
and various service bureaus ERWAY concluded pessimistically that no
breakthrough has been achieved   Incremental improvements have occurred
in some of the OCR technology some of the processes and some of the
standards acceptances which though they may lead to somewhat lower costs
do not offer much encouragement to many people who are anxiously awaiting
the day that the entire contents of LC are available online

                                 


ZIDAR  Several answers to why one attempts to perform fulltext
conversion  Per page cost of performing OCR  Typical problems
encountered during editing  Editing poor copy OCR vs rekeying 


Judith ZIDAR coordinator National Agricultural Text Digitizing Program
NATDP National Agricultural Library NAL offered several answers to
the question of why one attempts to perform fulltext conversion  
Text in an image can be read by a human but not by a computer so of
course it is not searchable and there is not much one can do with it  
Some material simply requires wordlevel access  For instance the legal
profession insists on fulltext access to its material with taxonomic or
geographic material which entails numerous names one virtually requires
wordlevel access   Full text permits rapid browsing and searching
something that cannot be achieved in an image with todays technology
 Text stored as ASCII and delivered in ASCII is standardized and highly
portable   People just want fulltext searching even those who do not
know how to do it  NAL for the most part is performing OCR at an
actual cost per averagesize page of approximately   NAL scans the
page to create the electronic image and passes it through the OCR device

ZIDAR next rehearsed several typical problems encountered during editing
Praising the celerity of her student workers ZIDAR observed that editing
requires approximately five to ten minutes per page assuming that there
are no large tables to audit  Confusion among the three characters I 
and l constitutes perhaps the most common problem encountered  Zeroes
and  Os also are  frequently confused  Double Ms create a particular
problem even on clean pages  They are so wide in most fonts that they
touch and the system simply cannot tell where one letter ends and the
other begins  Complex page formats occasionally fail to columnate
properly which entails rescanning as though one were working with a
single column entering the ASCII and decolumnating for better
searching  With proportionally spaced text OCR can have difficulty
discerning what is a space and what are merely spaces between letters as
opposed to spaces between words and therefore will merge text or break
up words where it should not

ZIDAR said that it can often take longer to edit a poorcopy OCR than to
key it from scratch  NAL has also experimented with partial editing of
text whereby project workers go into and clean up the format removing
stray characters but not running a spellcheck  NAL corrects typos in
the title and authors names which provides a foothold for searching and
browsing  Even extremely poorquality OCR eg percent accuracy
can still be searched because numerous words are correct while the
important words are probably repeated often enough that they are likely
to be found correct somewhere  Librarians however cannot tolerate this
situation though end users seem more willing to use this text for
searching provided that NAL indicates that it is unedited  ZIDAR
concluded that rekeying of text may be the best route to take in spite
of numerous problems with quality control and cost

                                 


DISCUSSION  Modifying an image before performing OCR  NALs costs per
page AMs costs per page and experience with Federal Prison Industries 
Elements comprising NATDPs costs per page  OCR and structured markup 
Distinction between the structure of a document and its representation
when put on the screen or printed 


HOOTON prefaced the lengthy discussion that followed with several
comments about modifying an image before one reaches the point of
performing OCR  For example in regard to an application containing a
significant amount of redundant data such as formtype data numerous
companies today are working on various kinds of form renewal prior to
going through a recognition process by using dropout colors  Thus
acquiring access to form design or using electronic means are worth
considering  HOOTON also noted that conversion usually makes or breaks
ones imaging system  It is extremely important extremely costly in
terms of either capital investment or service and determines the quality
of the remainder of ones system because it determines the character of
the raw material used by the system

Concerning the four projects undertaken by NAL two inside and two
performed by outside contractors ZIDAR revealed that an inhouse service
bureau executed the first at a cost between  and  per page for
everything including building of the database  The project undertaken
by the Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research CGIAR
cost approximately  per page for the conversion plus some expenses
for the software and building of the database  The Acid Rain Projecta
twodisk set produced by the University of Vermont consisting of
Canadian publications on acid raincost  per page for everything
including keying of the text which was double keyed scanning of the
images and building of the database  The inhouse project offered
considerable ease of convenience and greater control of the process  On
the other hand the service bureaus know their job and perform it
expeditiously because they have more people

As a useful comparison ERWAY revealed AMs costs as follows  
cents to  cents per thousand characters with an average page
containing  characters  Requirements for coding and imaging
increase the costs  Thus conversion of the text including the coding
costs approximately  per page  This figure does not include the
imaging and databasebuilding included in the NAL costs  AM also
enjoyed a happy experience with Federal Prison Industries which
precluded the necessity of going through the requestforproposal process
to award a contract because it is another government KFARWQ  PMY
