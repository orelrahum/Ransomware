World Economy

Overview
    Aggregate world output in  increased by  in contrast to estimated
     growth in  and  growth in  In  the developed countries
    grew by  and the LDCs by  these gains being offset by a  drop
    in the former Communistdominated areas of the USSR and Eastern Europe As
    usual results among individual countries differed widely In the developed
    group Japan led with  the West European members averaged  and the
    recessionplagued United States laggedwith GDP down  As for the 
    former Soviet republics and the seven nations of Eastern Europe output
    plummeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the
    rules of the game and in the channels of production and exchange China and
    the Four Dragons performed well in  but many of the other developing
    countries are mired in poverty and political instability For the world as a
    whole the addition of nearly  million people each year to an already
    overcrowded globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution
    desertification underemployment epidemics and famine

    equipment most of these advances take place in OECD nations only a small
    portion of nonOECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
    technological forces and the technological gap between the industrial
    nations and the lessdeveloped countries continues to widen the rapid
    development of new industrial and agricultural technology is complicating
    already grim environmental problems

World Economy

Agriculture
    the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last
     years The annual production of cereals for instance has risen by 
    from about  billion metric tons to about  billion metric tons
    production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
    increases in planted areas while global production is sufficient for
    aggregate demand about onefifth of the worlds population remains
    malnourished primarily because local production cannot adequately provide
    for large and rapidly growing populations which are too poor to pay for
    food imports conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
    recent years has exacerbated the consequences of all other factors

Yemen Economy

Overview
    Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united Yemen
    the southern city Aden with its refinery and port facilities is the
    economic and commercial capital Future economic development depends heavily
    on Westernassisted development of promising oil resources South Yemens
    willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet
    economic support
Overview
  North
    The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen
    dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential needs Large trade
    deficits have been made up for by remittances from Yemenis working abroad
    and foreign aid Once selfsufficient in food production northern Yemen has
    become a major importer Land once used for export crops  cotton fruit
    and vegetables  has been turned over to growing qat a mildly narcotic
    shrub chewed by Yemenis which has no significant export market Oil export
    revenues started flowing in late  and boosted  earnings by about
     million
  South
    This has been one of the poorest Arab countries with a per capita GNP of
    about  A shortage of natural resources a widely dispersed population
    and an arid climate have made economic development difficult The economy
    has grown at an average annual rate of only  since the mids The
    economy had been organized along socialist lines dominated by the public
    sector Economic growth has been constrained by a lack of incentives partly
    stemming from centralized control over production decisions investment
    allocation and import choices
