Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth
He scarce had said when the bare Earth till then
Desart and bare unsightly unadorned
Brought forth the tender grass whose verdure clad
Her universal face with pleasant green
Then herbs of every leaf that sudden flowered
Opening their various colours and made gay
Her bosom smelling sweet and these scarce blown
Forth flourished thick the clustering vine forth crept
The swelling gourd up stood the corny reed
Embattled in her field and the humble shrub
And bush with frizzled hair implicit  Last
Rose as in dance the stately trees and spread
Their branches hung with copious fruit or gemmed
Their blossoms  With high woods the hills were crowned
With tufts the valleys and each fountain side
With borders long the rivers that Earth now
Seemed like to Heaven a seat where Gods might dwell
Or wander with delight and love to haunt
Her sacred shades though God had yet not rained
Upon the Earth and man to till the ground
None was but from the Earth a dewy mist
Went up and watered all the ground and each
Plant of the field which ere it was in the Earth
God made and every herb before it grew
On the green stem  God saw that it was good
So even and morn recorded the third day
Again the Almighty spake Let there be lights
High in the expanse of Heaven to divide
The day from night and let them be for signs
For seasons and for days and circling years
And let them be for lights as I ordain
Their office in the firmament of Heaven
To give light on the Earth and it was so
And God made two great lights great for their use
To Man the greater to have rule by day
The less by night altern and made the stars
And set them in the firmament of Heaven
To illuminate the Earth and rule the day
In their vicissitude and rule the night
And light from darkness to divide  God saw
Surveying his great work that it was good
For of celestial bodies first the sun
A mighty sphere he framed unlightsome first
Though of ethereal mould then formed the moon
Globose and every magnitude of stars
And sowed with stars the Heaven thick as a field
Of light by far the greater part he took
Transplanted from her cloudy shrine and placed
In the suns orb made porous to receive
And drink the liquid light firm to retain
Her gathered beams great palace now of light
Hither as to their fountain other stars
Repairing in their golden urns draw light
And hence the morningplanet gilds her horns
By tincture or reflection they augment
Their small peculiar though from human sight
So far remote with diminution seen
First in his east the glorious lamp was seen
Regent of day and all the horizon round
Invested with bright rays jocund to run
His longitude through Heavens high road the gray
Dawn and the Pleiades before him danced
Shedding sweet influence  Less bright the moon
But opposite in levelled west was set
His mirrour with full face borrowing her light
From him for other light she needed none
In that aspect and still that distance keeps
Till night then in the east her turn she shines
Revolved on Heavens great axle and her reign
With thousand lesser lights dividual holds
With thousand thousand stars that then appeared
Spangling the hemisphere  Then first adorned
With their bright luminaries that set and rose
Glad evening and glad morn crowned the fourth day
And God said Let the waters generate
Reptile with spawn abundant living soul
And let fowl fly above the Earth with wings
Displayed on the open firmament of Heaven
And God created the great whales and each
Soul living each that crept which plenteously
The waters generated by their kinds
And every bird of wing after his kind
And saw that it was good and blessed them saying
Be fruitful multiply and in the seas
And lakes and running streams the waters fill
And let the fowl be multiplied on the Earth
Forthwith the sounds and seas each creek and bay
With fry innumerable swarm and shoals
Of fish that with their fins and shining scales
Glide under the green wave in sculls that oft
Bank the mid sea part single or with mate
Graze the seaweed their pasture and through groves
Of coral stray or sporting with quick glance
Show to the sun their waved coats dropt with gold
Or in their pearly shells at ease attend
Moist nutriment or under rocks their food
In jointed armour watch on smooth the seal
And bended dolphins play part huge of bulk
Wallowing unwieldy enormous in their gait
Tempest the ocean there leviathan
Hugest of living creatures on the deep
Stretched like a promontory sleeps or swims
And seems a moving land and at his gills
Draws in and at his trunk spouts out a sea
Mean while the tepid caves and fens and shores
Their brood as numerous hatch from the egg that soon
Bursting with kindly rupture forth disclosed
Their callow young but feathered soon and fledge
They summed their pens and soaring the air sublime
With clang despised the ground under a cloud
In prospect there the eagle and the stork
On cliffs and cedar tops their eyries build
Part loosely wing the region part more wise
In common ranged in figure wedge their way
Intelligent of seasons and set forth
Their aery caravan high over seas
Flying and over lands with mutual wing
Easing their flight so steers the prudent crane
Her annual voyage borne on winds the air
Floats as they pass fanned with unnumbered plumes
From branch to branch the smaller birds with song
Solaced the woods and spread their painted wings
Till even nor then the solemn nightingale
Ceased warbling but all night tund her soft lays
Others on silver lakes and rivers bathed
Their downy breast the swan with arched neck
Between her white wings mantling proudly rows
Her state with oary feet yet oft they quit
The dank and rising on stiff pennons tower
The mid aereal sky  Others on ground
Walked firm the crested cock whose clarion sounds
The silent hours and the other whose gay train
Adorns him coloured with the florid hue
Of rainbows and starry eyes  The waters thus
With fish replenished and the air with fowl
Evening and morn solemnized the fifth day
The sixth and of creation last arose
With evening harps and matin when God said
Let the Earth bring forth soul living in her kind
Cattle and creeping things and beast of the Earth
Each in their kind  The Earth obeyed and straight
Opening her fertile womb teemed at a birth
Innumerous living creatures perfect forms
Limbed and full grown  Out of the ground up rose
As from his lair the wild beast where he wons
In forest wild in thicket brake or den
Among the trees in pairs they rose they walked
The cattle in the fields and meadows green
Those rare and solitary these in flocks
Pasturing at once and in broad herds upsprung
The grassy clods now calved now half appeared
The tawny lion pawing to get free
His hinder parts then springs as broke from bonds
And rampant shakes his brinded mane the ounce
The libbard and the tiger as the mole
Rising the crumbled earth above them threw
In hillocks  The swift stag from under ground
Bore up his branching head  Scarce from his mould
Behemoth biggest born of earth upheaved
His vastness  Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose
As plants  Ambiguous between sea and land
The riverhorse and scaly crocodile
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground
Insect or worm those waved their limber fans
For wings and smallest lineaments exact
In all the liveries decked of summers pride
With spots of gold and purple azure and green
These as a line their long dimension drew
Streaking the ground with sinuous trace not all
Minims of nature some of serpentkind
Wonderous in length and corpulence involved
Their snaky folds and added wings  First crept
The parsimonious emmet provident
Of future in small room large heart enclosed
Pattern of just equality perhaps
Hereafter joined in her popular tribes
Of commonalty  Swarming next appeared
The female bee that feeds her husband drone
Deliciously and builds her waxen cells
With honey stored  The rest are numberless
And thou their natures knowest and gavest them names
Needless to thee repeated nor unknown
The serpent subtlest beast of all the field
Of huge extent sometimes with brazen eyes
And hairy mane terrifick though to thee
Not noxious but obedient at thy call
Now Heaven in all her glory shone and rolled
Her motions as the great first Movers hand
First wheeled their course  Earth in her rich attire
Consummate lovely smiled air water earth
By fowl fish beast was flown was swum was walked
Frequent and of the sixth day yet remained
There wanted yet the masterwork the end
Of all yet done a creature who not prone
And brute as other creatures but endued
With sanctity of reason might erect
His stature and upright with front serene
Govern the rest selfknowing and from thence
Magnanimous to correspond with Heaven
But grateful to acknowledge whence his good
Descends thither with heart and voice and eyes
Directed in devotion to adore
And worship God Supreme who made him chief
Of all his works  therefore the Omnipotent
Eternal Father for where is not he
Present? thus to his Son audibly spake
Let us make now Man in our image Man
In our similitude and let them rule
Over the fish and fowl of sea and air
Beast of the field and over all the Earth
And every creeping thing that creeps the ground
This said he formed thee Adam thee O Man
Dust of the ground and in thy nostrils breathed
The breath of life in his own image he
Created thee in the image of God
Express and thou becamest a living soul
Male he created thee but thy consort
Female for race then blessed mankind and said
Be fruitful multiply and fill the Earth
Subdue it and throughout dominion hold
Over fish of the sea and fowl of the air
And every living thing that moves on the Earth
Wherever thus created for no place
Is yet distinct by name thence as thou knowest
He brought thee into this delicious grove
This garden planted with the trees of God
Delectable both to behold and taste
And freely all their pleasant fruit for food
Gave thee all sorts are here that all the Earth yields
Variety without end but of the tree
Which tasted works knowledge of good and evil
Thou mayest not in the day thou eatest thou diest
Death is the penalty imposed beware
And govern well thy appetite lest Sin
Surprise thee and her black attendant Death
Here finished he and all that he had made
Viewed and behold all was entirely good
So even and morn accomplished the sixth day
Yet not till the Creator from his work
Desisting though unwearied up returned
Up to the Heaven of Heavens his high abode
Thence to behold this new created world
The addition of his empire how it showed
In prospect from his throne how good how fair
Answering his great idea  Up he rode
Followed with acclamation and the sound
Symphonious of ten thousand harps that tuned
Angelick harmonies  The earth the air
Resounded thou rememberest for thou heardst
The heavens and all the constellations rung
The planets in their station listening stood
While the bright pomp ascended jubilant
Open ye everlasting gates they sung
Open ye Heavens your living doorslet in
The great Creator from his work returned
Magnificent his six days work a World
Open and henceforth oft for God will deign
To visit oft the dwellings of just men
Delighted and with frequent intercourse
Thither will send his winged messengers
On errands of supernal grace  So sung
The glorious train ascending  He through Heaven
That opened wide her blazing portals led
To Gods eternal house direct the way
A broad and ample road whose dust is gold
And pavement stars as stars to thee appear
Seen in the galaxy that milky way
Which nightly as a circling zone thou seest
Powdered with stars  And now on Earth the seventh
Evening arose in Eden for the sun
Was set and twilight from the east came on
Forerunning night when at the holy mount
Of Heavens highseated top the imperial throne
Of Godhead fixed for ever firm and sure
The Filial Power arrived and sat him down
With his great Father for he also went
Invisible yet staid such privilege
Hath Omnipresence and the work ordained
Author and End of all things and from work
Now resting blessed and hallowed the seventh day
As resting on that day from all his work
But not in silence holy kept the harp
Had work and rested not the solemn pipe
And dulcimer all organs of sweet stop
All sounds on fret by string or golden wire
Tempered soft tunings intermixed with voice
Choral or unison of incense clouds
Fuming from golden censers hid the mount
Creation and the six days acts they sung
Great are thy works Jehovah infinite
Thy power what thought can measure thee or tongue
Relate thee  Greater now in thy return
Than from the giant Angels  Thee that day
Thy thunders magnified but to create
Is greater than created to destroy
Who can impair thee Mighty King or bound
Thy empire  Easily the proud attempt
Of Spirits apostate and their counsels vain
Thou hast repelled while impiously they thought
Thee to diminish and from thee withdraw
The number of thy worshippers  Who seeks
To lessen thee against his purpose serves
To manifest the more thy might his evil
Thou usest and from thence createst more good
Witness this newmade world another Heaven
From Heavengate not far founded in view
On the clear hyaline the glassy sea
Of amplitude almost immense with stars
Numerous and every star perhaps a world
Of destined habitation but thou knowest
Their seasons among these the seat of Men
Earth with her nether ocean circumfused
Their pleasant dwellingplace  PMDHRQ UEZSQ OAR
