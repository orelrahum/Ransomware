    agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned Sandinista economic
    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis The foundation
    of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities
    largely coffee and cotton Farm production fell by roughly  in  and

Niger Economy

Overview
    About  of the population is engaged in farming and stock raising

    depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits Uranium

    when world prices declined France is a major customer while Germany
    Japan and Spain also make regular purchases The depressed demand for
    uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy a severe
    trade imbalance and a mounting external debt
