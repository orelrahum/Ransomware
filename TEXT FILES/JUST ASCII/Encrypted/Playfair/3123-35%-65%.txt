    including fishing and forestry is the mainstay of the economy accounting
    for over  of GDP employing about  of the labor force and
    contributing to more than  of total export earnings Industry is largely
    confined to the processing of agricultural products and textile
    manufacturing in  it accounted for only  of GDP and employed almost
     of the labor force In  the government introduced a fiveyear
    development plan that stressed selfsufficiency in food mainly rice by
     increased production for exports and reduced energy imports After
    mid however output dropped sharply because of protracted
    antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political reform
