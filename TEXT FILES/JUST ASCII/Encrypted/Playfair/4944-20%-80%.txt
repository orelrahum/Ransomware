Peru Economy

Overview
    The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented with a large
    dose of government ownership remaining in mining energy and banking In
    the s the economy suffered from hyperinflation declining per capita
    output and mounting external debt Peru was shut off from IMF and World
    Bank support in the mids because of its huge debt arrears An austerity
    program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in
    July  contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
    activity but the slide halted late in the year and output rose  in
     After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
    government price subsidies monthly price increases eased to the
    singledigit level and by December  dropped to the lowest increase since
    mid Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
    in September  and although it faces  billion in arrears on its
    external debt is working to pay some  billion of these to the IMF and
    World Bank by

Poland Economy

Overview
    Poland is undergoing a difficult transition from a Sovietstyle economy 
    with state ownership and control of productive assets  to a market economy
    On January   the new Solidarityled government implemented shock
    therapy by slashing subsidies decontrolling prices tightening the money
    supply stabilizing the foreign exchange rate lowering import barriers and
    restraining state sector wages As a result consumer goods shortages and
    lines disappeared and inflation fell from  in  to  in 
    Western governments which hold twothirds of Polands  billion external
    debt pledged in  to forgive half of Polands official debt by  and
    the private sector grew accounting for  of industrial production and 
    of nonagricultural output by  Production fell in state enterprises
    however and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing
    in  to  in December  Poland fell out of compliance with its
    IMF program by mid and talks with commercial creditors stalled The
    increase in unemployment and the decline in living standards led to popular
    discontent and a change in government in January  and again in December
    The new government has promised selective industrial intervention some
    relaxation in monetary policy and an improved social safety net but will
    be constrained by the decline in output and the growing budget deficit
