Hungary Economy

Overview
    Hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition between a command and a
    market economy Agriculture is an important sector providing sizable export
    earnings and meeting domestic food needs Industry accounts for about  of
    GDP and  of employment Hungary claims that less than  of foreign
    trade is now with former CEMA countries while about  is with OECD
    members Hungarys economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it
    a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment
    In  Hungary received half of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe
    and in  received the largest single share The growing private sector
    accounts for onequarter to onethird of national output according to
    unofficial estimates Privatization of state enterprises is progressing
    although excessive redtape bureaucratic oversight and uncertainties about
    pricing have slowed the process Escalating unemployment and high rates of
    inflation may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform
    while Hungarys heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to
    introduce full convertability of the forint before
