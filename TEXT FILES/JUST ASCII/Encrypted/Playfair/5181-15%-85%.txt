Falkland Islands Islas Malvinas Economy

Overview
    The economy is based on sheep farming which directly or indirectly employs
    most of the work force A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic
    consumption of milk and milk products and crops grown are primarily those
    for providing winter fodder Exports feature shipments of highgrade wool to
    the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins Rich stocks of fish in the
    surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders So far
    efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful In
     the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
    operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone These license fees
    amount to more than  million per year and are a primary source of income
    for the government To encourage tourism the Falkland Islands Development
    Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant
    wildlife and trout fishing
