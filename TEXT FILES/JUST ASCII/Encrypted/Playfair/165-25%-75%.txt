Which it had long stood under strained to the highth
In that celestial colloquy sublime
As with an object that excels the sense
Dazzled and spent sunk down and sought repair
Of sleep which instantly fell on me called
By Nature as in aid and closed mine eyes
Mine eyes he closed but open left the cell
Of fancy my internal sight by which
Abstract as in a trance methought I saw
Though sleeping where I lay and saw the shape
Still glorious before whom awake I stood
Who stooping opened my left side and took
From thence a rib with cordial spirits warm
And lifeblood streaming fresh wide was the wound
But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed
The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands
Under his forming hands a creature grew
Manlike but different sex so lovely fair
That what seemed fair in all the world seemed now
Mean or in her summed up in her contained
And in her looks which from that time infused
Sweetness into my heart unfelt before
And into all things from her air inspired
The spirit of love and amorous delight
She disappeared and left me dark I waked
To find her or for ever to deplore
Her loss and other pleasures all abjure
When out of hope behold her not far off
Such as I saw her in my dream adorned
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow
To make her amiable  On she came
Led by her heavenly Maker though unseen
And guided by his voice nor uninformed
Of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites
Grace was in all her steps Heaven in her eye
In every gesture dignity and love
I overjoyed could not forbear aloud
This turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilled
Thy words Creator bounteous LAC VARDIW
