  What for? said the one who had spoken first

  Thats none of YOUR business Two said Seven

  Yes it IS his business said Five and Ill tell himit
was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions

  Seven flung down his brush and had just begun Well of all
the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as
she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly  the
others looked round also and all of them bowed low

  Would you tell me said Alice a little timidly why you are
painting those roses?

  Five and Seven said nothing but looked at Two  Two began in a
low voice Why the fact is you see Miss this here ought to
have been a RED rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake
and if the Queen was to find it out we should all have our heads
cut off you know  So you see Miss were doing our best afore
she comes to  At this moment Five who had been anxiously
looking across the garden called out The Queen  The Queen
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
their faces  There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice
looked round eager to see the Queen

  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped
like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and
feet at the corners  next the ten courtiers these were
ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the
soldiers did  After these came the royal children there were
ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
in hand in couples  they were all ornamented with hearts  Next
came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice
recognised the White Rabbit  it was talking in a hurried nervous
manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without
noticing her  Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the
Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this
grand procession came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS

  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on
her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember
every having heard of such a rule at processions and besides
what would be the use of a procession thought she if people
had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see
it?  So she stood still where she was and waited

  When the procession came opposite to Alice they all stopped
and looked at her and the Queen said severely Who is this?
She said it to the Knave of Hearts who only bowed and smiled in
reply

  Idiot said the Queen tossing her head impatiently and
turning to Alice she went on Whats your name child?

  My name is Alice so please your Majesty said Alice very
politely but she added to herself Why theyre only a pack of
cards after all  I neednt be afraid of them

  And who are THESE? said the Queen pointing to the three
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as
they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs
was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether
they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her
own children

  How should I know? said Alice surprised at her own courage
Its no business of MINE

  The Queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her
for a moment like a wild beast screamed Off with her head
Off

  Nonsense said Alice very loudly and decidedly and the
Queen was silent

  The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said
Consider my dear  she is only a child

  The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave
Turn them over

  The Knave did so very carefully with one foot

  Get up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the
three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the
King the Queen the royal children and everybody else

  Leave off that screamed the Queen  You make me giddy
And then turning to the rosetree she went on What HAVE you
been doing here?

  May it please your Majesty said Two in a very humble tone
going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying

  I see said the Queen who had meanwhile been examining the
roses  Off with their heads and the procession moved on
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
gardeners who ran to Alice for protection

  You shant be beheaded said Alice and she put them into a
large flowerpot that stood near  The three soldiers wandered
about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly
marched off after the others

  Are their heads off? shouted the Queen

  Their heads are gone if it please your Majesty the soldiers
shouted in reply

  Thats right shouted the Queen  Can you play croquet?

  The soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question
was evidently meant for her

  Yes shouted Alice

  Come on then roared the Queen and Alice joined the
procession wondering very much what would happen next

  Itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side
She was walking by the White Rabbit who was peeping anxiously
into her face

  Very said Alice  wheres the Duchess?

  Hush  Hush said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone  He
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised
himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and
whispered Shes under sentence of execution

  What for? said Alice

  Did you say "What a pity"? the Rabbit asked

  No I didnt said Alice  I dont think its at all a pity
I said "What for?"

  She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began  Alice gave a
little scream of laughter  Oh hush the Rabbit whispered in a
frightened tone  The Queen will hear you  You see she came
rather late and the Queen said

  Get to your places shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder
and people began running about in all directions tumbling up
against each other however they got settled down in a minute or
two and the game began  Alice thought she had never seen such a
curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and
furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live
flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to
stand on their hands and feet to make the arches

  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her
flamingo  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away
comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down
but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened
out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it
WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face with such a
puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing
and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself and was in the act of crawling away  besides all this
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the
ground Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
difficult game indeed

  The players all played at once without waiting for turns
quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in
a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion and went
stamping about and shouting Off with his head or Off with
her head about once in a minute

  Alice began to feel very uneasy  to be sure she had not as
yet had any dispute with the Queen but she knew that it might
happen any minute and then thought she what would become of
me?  Theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great
wonder is that theres any one left alive

  She was looking about for some way of escape and wondering
whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a
curious appearance in the air  it puzzled her very much at
first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to
be a grin and she said to herself Its the Cheshire Cat  now I
shall have somebody to talk to

  How are you getting on? said the Cat as soon as there was
mouth enough for it to speak with

  Alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded  Its no
use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at
least one of them  In another minute the whole head appeared
and then Alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the
game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her  The
Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and
no more of it appeared

  I dont think they play at all fairly Alice began in rather
a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant
hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in
particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand
youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive
for instance theres the arch Ive got to go through next
walking about at the other end of the groundand I should have
croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it
saw mine coming

  How do you like the Queen? said the Cat in a low voice

  Not at all said Alice  shes so extremely  Just then
she noticed that the Queen was close behind her listening  so
she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while
finishing the game

  The Queen smiled and passed on

  Who ARE you talking to? said the King going up to Alice and
looking at the Cats head with great curiosity

  Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat said Alice  allow me
to introduce it

  I dont like the look of it at all said the King  however
it may kiss my hand if it likes

  Id rather not the Cat remarked

  Dont be impertinent said the King and dont look at me
like that  He got behind Alice as he spoke

  A cat may look at a king said Alice  Ive read that in
some book but I dont remember where

  Well it must be removed said the King very decidedly and
he called the Queen who was passing at the moment My dear  I
wish you would have this cat removed

  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great
or small  Off with his head she said without even looking
round

  Ill fetch the executioner myself said the King eagerly and
he hurried off

  Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game
was going on as she heard the Queens voice in the distance
screaming with passion  She had already heard her sentence three
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and
she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in
such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or
not  So she went in search of her hedgehog

  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one
of them with the other  the only difficulty was that her
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
into a tree

  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back
the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight
but it doesnt matter much thought Alice as all the arches
are gone from this side of the ground  So she tucked it away
under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for
a little more conversation with her friend

  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to
find quite a large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute
going on between the executioner the King and the Queen who
were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent
and looked very uncomfortable

  The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to
settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her
though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed
to make out exactly what they said

  The executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a
head unless there was a body to cut it off from  that he had
never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin
at HIS time of life

  The Kings argument was that anything that had a head could be
beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense

  The Queens argument was that if something wasnt done about
it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round
It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so
grave and anxious

  Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the
Duchess  youd better ask HER about it

  Shes in prison the Queen said to the executioner  fetch
her here  And the executioner went off like an arrow

   The Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and
by the time he had come back with the Dutchess it had entirely
disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and
down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game



                           CHAPTER IX

                     The Mock Turtles Story


  You cant think how glad I am to see you again you dear old
thing said the Duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately
into Alices and they walked off together

  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen

  When IM a Duchess she said to herself not in a very
hopeful tone though I wont have any pepper in my kitchen AT
ALL  Soup does very well withoutMaybe its always pepper that
makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at
having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them
