quantity 


During the questionandanswer period that followed FLEISCHHAUERs
presentation several clarifications were made

AM is bringing in motion pictures from a videodisc  The framegrabber
devices create a window on a computer screen which permits users to
digitize a single frame of the movie or one of the photographs  It
produces a crude roughandready image that high school students can
incorporate into papers and that has worked very nicely in this way

Commenting on FLEISCHHAUERs assertion that AM was looking more at
searching ideas than words MYLONAS argued that without words an idea
does not exist  FLEISCHHAUER conceded that he ought to have articulated
his point more clearly  MYLONAS stated that they were in fact both
talking about the same thing  By searching for words and by forcing
people to focus on the word the Perseus Project felt that they would get
them to the idea  The way one reviews results is tailored more to one
kind of user than another

Concerning the total volume of material that has been processed in this
way AM at this point has in retrievable form seven or eight collections
all of them photographic  In the Macintosh environment for example
there probably are  photographs  The sound recordings
number sixty items  The broadsides number about  items  There are
 political cartoons in the form of drawings  The motion pictures as
individual items number sixty to seventy

AM also has a manuscript collection the life history portion of one of
the federal project series which will contain  individual
documents all firstperson narratives  AM has in process about 
AfricanAmerican pamphlets or about  printed pages for the period
  Also in the works are some  panoramic photographs  AM
has recycled a fair amount of the work done by LCs Prints and
Photographs Division during the Librarys optical disk pilot project in
the s  For example a special division of LC has tooled up and
thought through all the ramifications of electronic presentation of
photographs  Indeed they are wheeling them out in great barrel loads
The purpose of AM within the Library it is hoped is to catalyze several
of the other special collection divisions which have no particular
experience with in some cases mixed feelings about an activity such as
AM  Moreover in many cases the divisions may be characterized as not
only lacking experience in "electronifying" things but also in automated
cataloguing  MARC cataloguing as practiced in the United States is
heavily weighted toward the description of monograph and serial
materials but is much thinner when one enters the world of manuscripts
and things that are held in the Librarys music collection and other
units  In response to a comment by LESK that AMs material is very
heavily photographic and is so primarily because individual records have
been made for each photograph FLEISCHHAUER observed that an itemlevel
catalog record exists for example for each photograph in the Detroit
Publishing collection of  pictures  In the case of the Federal
Writers Project for which nearly  documents exist representing
information from twentysix different states AM with the assistance of
Karen STUART of the Manuscript Division will attempt to find some way not
only to have a collectionlevel record but perhaps a MARC record for each
state which will then serve as an umbrella for the  documents
that come under it  But that drama remains to be enacted  The AM staff
is conservative and clings to cataloguing though of course visitors tout
artificial intelligence and neural networks in a manner that suggests that
perhaps one need not have cataloguing or that much of it could be put aside

The matter of SGML coding FLEISCHHAUER conceded returned the discussion
to the earlier treated question of quality versus quantity in the Library
of Congress  Of course text conversion can be done with percent
accuracy but it means that when ones holdings are as vast as LCs only
a tiny amount will be exposed whereas permitting lower levels of
accuracy can lead to exposing or sharing larger amounts but with the
quality correspondingly impaired

                                 


TWOHIG  A contrary experience concerning electronic options  Volume of
material in the Washington papers and a suggestion of David Packard 
Implications of Packards suggestion  Transcribing the documents for the
CDROM  Accuracy of transcriptions  The CDROM edition of the Founding
Fathers documents 


Finding encouragement in a comment of MICHELSONs from the morning
sessionthat numerous people in the humanities were choosing electronic
options to do their workDorothy TWOHIG editor The Papers of George
Washington opened her illustrated talk by noting that her experience
with literary scholars and numerous people in editing was contrary to
MICHELSONs  TWOHIG emphasized literary scholars complete ignorance of
the technological options available to them or their reluctance or in
some cases their downright hostility toward these options

After providing an overview of the five Founding Fathers projects
Jefferson at Princeton Franklin at Yale John Adams at the
Massachusetts Historical Society and Madison down the hall from her at
the University of Virginia TWOHIG observed that the Washington papers
like all of the projects include both sides of the Washington
correspondence and deal with some  documents to be published with
extensive annotation in eighty to eightyfive volumes a project that
will not be completed until well into the next century  Thus it was
with considerable enthusiasm several years ago that the Washington Papers
Project WPP greeted David Packards suggestion that the papers of the
Founding Fathers could be published easily and inexpensively and to the
great benefit of American scholarship via CDROM

In pragmatic terms funding from the Packard Foundation would expedite
the transcription of thousands of documents waiting to be put on disk in
the WPP offices  Further since the costs of collecting editing and
converting the Founding Fathers documents into letterpress editions were
running into the millions of dollars and the considerable staffs
involved in all of these projects were devoting their careers to
producing the work the Packard Foundations suggestion had a
revolutionary aspect  Transcriptions of the entire corpus of the
Founding Fathers papers would be available on CDROM to public and
college libraries even high schools at a fraction of the cost
 for the annual license feeto produce a limited university
press run of  of each volume of the published papers at  per
printed volume  Given the current budget crunch in educational systems
and the corresponding constraints on librarians in smaller institutions
who wish to add these volumes to their collections producing the
documents on CDROM would likely open a greatly expanded audience for the
papers  TWOHIG stressed however that development of the Founding
Fathers CDROM is still in its infancy  Serious software problems remain
to be resolved before the material can be put into readable form

Funding from the Packard Foundation resulted in a major push to
transcribe the  or so documents of the Washington papers remaining
to be transcribed onto computer disks  Slides illustrated several of the
problems encountered for example the present inability of CDROM to
indicate the crossouts deleted material in eighteenth century
documents  TWOHIG next described documents from various periods in the
eighteenth century that have been transcribed in chronological order and
delivered to the Packard offices in California where they are converted
to the CDROM a process that is expected to consume five years to
complete that is reckoning from David Packards suggestion made several
years ago until about July   TWOHIG found an encouraging
indication of the projects benefits in the ongoing use made by scholars
of the search functions of the CDROM particularly in reducing the time
spent in manually turning the pages of the Washington papers

TWOHIG next furnished details concerning the accuracy of transcriptions
For instance the insertion of thousands of documents on the CDROM
currently does not permit each document to be verified against the
original manuscript several times as in the case of documents that appear
in the published edition  However the transcriptions receive a cursory
check for obvious typos the misspellings of proper names and other
errors from the WPP CDROM editor  Eventually all documents that appear
in the electronic version will be checked by project editors  Although
this process has met with opposition from some of the editors on the
grounds that imperfect work may leave their offices the advantages in
making this material available as a research tool outweigh  fears about the
misspelling of proper names and other relatively minor editorial matters

Completion of all five Founding Fathers projects ie retrievability
and searchability of all of the documents by proper names alternate
spellings or varieties of subjects will provide one of the richest
sources of this size for the history of the United States in the latter
part of the eighteenth century  Further publication on CDROM will
allow editors to include even minutiae such as laundry lists not
included in the printed volumes

It seems possible that the extensive annotation provided in the printed
volumes eventually will be added to the CDROM edition pending
negotiations with the publishers of the papers  At the moment the
Founding Fathers CDROM is accessible only on the IBYCUS a computer
developed out of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae project and designed for
the use of classical scholars  There are perhaps  IBYCUS computers in
the country most of which are in university classics departments
Ultimately it is anticipated that the CDROM edition of the Founding
Fathers documents will run on any IBMcompatible or Macintosh computer
with a CDROM drive  Numerous changes in the software will also occur
before the project is completed  Editors note an IBYCUS was
unavailable to demonstrate the CDROM

                                 


DISCUSSION  Several additional features of WPP clarified 


Discussion following TWOHIGs presentation served to clarify several
additional features including  that the projects primary
intellectual product consists in the electronic transcription of the
material  that the text transmitted to the CDROM people is not
marked up  that cataloging and subjectindexing of the material
remain to be worked out though at this point material can be retrieved
by name and  that because all the searching is done in the hardware
the IBYCUS is designed to read a CDROM which contains only sequential
text files  Technically it then becomes very easy to read the material
off and put it on another device

                                 


LEBRON  Overview of the history of the joint project between AAAS and
OCLC  Several practices the online environment shares with traditional
publishing on hard copy  Several technical and behavioral barriers to
electronic publishing  How AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of
clinical trials  Advantages of the electronic format and other features
of OJCCT  An illustrated tour of the journal 


Maria LEBRON managing editor The Online Journal of Current Clinical
Trials OJCCT presented an illustrated overview of the history of the
joint project between the American Association for the Advancement of
Science AAAS and the Online Computer Library Center Inc OCLC  The
joint venture between AAAS and OCLC owes its beginning to a
reorganization launched by the new chief executive officer at OCLC about
three years ago and combines the strengths of these two disparate
organizations  In short OJCCT represents the process of scholarly
publishing on line

LEBRON next discussed several practices the online environment shares
with traditional publishing on hard copyfor example peer review of
manuscriptsthat are highly important in the academic world  LEBRON
noted in particular the implications of citation counts for tenure
committees and grants committees  In the traditional hardcopy
environment citation counts are readily demonstrable whereas the
online environment represents an ethereal medium to most academics

LEBRON remarked several technical and behavioral barriers to electronic
publishing for instance the problems in transmission created by special
characters or by complex graphics and halftones  In addition she noted
economic limitations such as the storage costs of maintaining back issues
and market or audience education

Manuscripts cannot be uploaded to OJCCT LEBRON explained because it is
not a bulletin board or Email forms of electronic transmission of
information that have created an ambience clouding peoples understanding
of what the journal is attempting to do  OJCCT which publishes
peerreviewed medical articles dealing with the subject of clinical
trials includes text tabular material and graphics although at this
time it can transmit only line illustrations

Next LEBRON described how AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of
clinical trials  It is  a highly statistical discipline that  does
not require halftones but can satisfy the needs of its audience with line
illustrations and graphic material and  there is a need for the speedy
dissemination of highquality research results  Clinical trials are
research activities that involve the administration of a test treatment
to some experimental unit in order to test its usefulness before it is
made available to the general population  LEBRON proceeded to give
additional information on OJCCT concerning its editorinchief editorial
board editorial content and the types of articles it publishes
including peerreviewed research reports and reviews as well as
features shared by other traditional hardcopy journals

Among the advantages of the electronic format are faster dissemination of
information including raw data and the absence of space constraints
because pages do not exist  This latter fact creates an interesting
situation when it comes to citations  Nor are there any issues  AAASs
capacity to download materials directly from the journal to a
subscribers printer hard drive or floppy disk helps ensure highly
accurate transcription  Other features of OJCCT include onscreen alerts
that allow linkage of subsequently published documents to the original
documents online searching by subject author title etc indexing of
every single word that appears in an article viewing access to an
article by component abstract full text or graphs numbered
paragraphs to replace page counts publication in Science every thirty
days of indexing of all articles published in the journal
typesetquality screens and Hypertext links that enable subscribers to
bring up Medline abstracts directly without leaving the journal

After detailing the two primary ways to gain access to the journal
through the OCLC network and Compuserv if one desires graphics or through
the Internet if just an ASCII file is desired LEBRON illustrated the
speedy editorial process and the coding of the document using SGML tags
after it has been accepted for publication  She also gave an illustrated
tour of the journal its searchandretrieval capabilities in particular
but also including problems associated with scanning in illustrations
and the importance of onscreen alerts to the medical profession re
retractions or corrections or more frequently editorials letters to
the editors or followup reports  She closed by inviting the audience
to join AAAS on  July when OJCCT was scheduled to go online

                                 


DISCUSSION  Additional features of OJCCT 


In the lengthy discussion that followed LEBRONs presentation these
points emerged

      The SGML text can be tailored as users wish

      All these articles have a fairly simple document definition

      Documenttype definitions DTDs were developed and given to OJCCT
     for coding

      No articles will be removed from the journal  Because there are
     no back issues there are no lost issues either  Once a subscriber
     logs onto the journal he or she has access not only to the currently
     published materials but retrospectively to everything that has been
     published in it  Thus the table of contents grows bigger  The date
     of publication serves to distinguish between currently published
     materials and older materials

      The pricing system for the journal resembles that for most medical
     journals  for   for a year plus telecommunications charges
     there are no connect time charges    for   for the
     entire year for single users though the journal can be put on a
     local area network LAN  However only one person can access the
     journal at a time  Site licenses may come in the future

      AAAS is working closely with colleagues at OCLC to display
     mathematical equations on screen

      Without compromising any steps in the editorial process the
     technology has reduced the time lag between when a manuscript is
     originally submitted and the time it is accepted the review process
     does not differ greatly from the standard sixtoeight weeks
     employed by many of the hardcopy journals  The process still
     depends on people

      As far as a preservation copy is concerned articles will be
     maintained on the computer permanently and subscribers as part of
     their subscription will receive a microfichequality archival copy
     of everything published during that year in addition reprints can
     be purchased in much the same way as in a hardcopy environment
     Hard copies are prepared but are not the primary medium for the
     dissemination of the information

      Because OJCCT is not yet on line it is difficult to know how many
     people would simply browse through the journal on the screen as
     opposed to downloading the whole thing and printing it out a mix of
     both types of users likely will result

                                 


PERSONIUS  Developments in technology over the past decade  The CLASS
Project  Advantages for technology and for the CLASS Project 
Developing a network application an underlying assumption of the project
 Details of the scanning process  Printondemand copies of books 
Future plans include development of a browsing tool 


Lynne PERSONIUS assistant director Cornell Information Technologies for
Scholarly Information Services Cornell University first commented on
the tremendous impact that developments in technology over the past ten
yearsnetworking in particularhave had on the way information is
handled and how in her own case these developments have counterbalanced
Cornells relative geographical isolation  Other significant technologies
include scanners which are much more sophisticated than they were ten years
ago mass storage and the dramatic savings that result from it in terms of
both space and money relative to twenty or thirty years ago new and
improved printing technologies which have greatly affected the distribution
of information and of course digital technologies whose applicability to
library preservation remains at issue

Given that context PERSONIUS described the College Library Access and
Storage System CLASS Project a library preservation project
primarily and what has been accomplished  Directly funded by the
Commission on Preservation and Access and by the Xerox Corporation which
has provided a significant amount of hardware the CLASS Project has been
working with a development team at Xerox to develop a software
application tailored to library preservation requirements  Within
Cornell participants in the project have been working jointly with both
library and information technologies  The focus of the project has been
on reformatting and saving books that are in brittle condition
PERSONIUS showed Workshop participants a brittle book and described how
such books were the result of developments in papermaking around the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution  The papermaking process was
changed so that a significant amount of acid was introduced into the
actual paper itself which deteriorates as it sits on library shelves

One of the advantages for technology and for the CLASS Project is that
the information in brittle books is mostly out of copyright and thus
offers an opportunity to work with material that requires library
preservation and to create and work on an infrastructure to save the
material  Acknowledging the familiarity of those working in preservation
with this information PERSONIUS noted that several things are being
done  the primary preservation technology used today is photocopying of
brittle material  Saving the intellectual content of the material is the
main goal  With microfilm copy the intellectual content is preserved on
the assumption that in the future the image can be reformatted in any
other way that then exists

An underlying assumption of the CLASS Project from the beginning was
that it would develop a network application  Project staff scan books
at a workstation located in the library near the brittle material
An imageserver filing system is located at a distance from that
workstation and a printer is located in another building  All of the
materials digitized and stored on the imagefiling system are cataloged
in the online catalogue  In fact a record for each of these electronic
books is stored in the RLIN database so that a record exists of what is
in the digital library throughout standard catalogue procedures  In the
future researchers working from their own workstations in their offices
or their networks will have accesswherever they might bethrough a
request server being built into the new digital library  A second
assumption is that the preferred means of finding the material will be by
looking through a catalogue  PERSONIUS described the scanning process
which uses a prototype scanner being developed by Xerox and which scans a
very high resolution image at great speed  Another significant feature
because this is a preservation application is the placing of the pages
that fall apart one for one on the platen  Ordinarily a scanner could
be used with some sort of a document feeder but because of this
application that is not feasible  Further because CLASS is a
preservation application after the paper replacement is made there a
very careful quality control check is performed  An original book is
compared to the printed copy and verification is made before proceeding
that all of the image all of the information has been captured  Then
a new library book is produced  The printed images are rebound by a
commercial binder and a new book is returned to the shelf
Significantly the books returned to the library shelves are beautiful
and useful replacements on acidfree paper that should last a long time
in effect the equivalent of preservation photocopies  Thus the project
has a library of digital books  In essence CLASS is scanning and
storing books as  dotperinch bitmapped images compressed using
Group  CCITT ie the French acronym for International Consultative
Committee for Telegraph and Telephone compression  They are stored as
TIFF files on an optical filing system that is composed of a database
used for searching and locating the books and an optical jukebox that
stores  twelveinch platters  A veryhighresolution printed copy of
these books at  dots per inch is created using a Xerox DocuTech
printer to make the paper replacements on acidfree paper

PERSONIUS maintained that the CLASS Project presents an opportunity to
introduce people to books as digital images by using a paper medium
Books are returned to the shelves while people are also given the ability
to print on demandto make their own copies of books  PERSONIUS
distributed copies of an engineering journal published by engineering
students at Cornell around  as an example of what a printondemand
copy of material might be like  This very cheap copy would be available
to people to use for their own research purposes and would bridge the gap
between an electronic work and the paper that readers like to have
PERSONIUS then attempted to illustrate a very early prototype of
networked access to this digital library  Xerox Corporation has
developed a prototype of a view station that can send images across the
network to be viewed

The particular library brought down for demonstration contained two
mathematics books  CLASS is developing and will spend the next year
developing an application that allows people at workstations to browse
the books  Thus CLASS is developing a browsing tool on the assumption
that users do not want to read an entire book from a workstation but
would prefer to be able to look through and decide if they would like to
have a printed copy of it

                                 


DISCUSSION  Re retrieval software  "Digital file copyright"  Scanning
rate during production  Autosegmentation  Criteria employed in
selecting books for scanning  Compression and decompression of images 
OCR not precluded 


During the questionandanswer period that followed her presentation
PERSONIUS made these additional points

      Re retrieval software Cornell is developing a Unixbased server
     as well as clients for the server that support multiple platforms
     Macintosh IBM and Sun workstations in the hope that people from
     any of those platforms will retrieve books a further operating
     assumption is that standard interfaces will be used as much as
     possible where standards can be put in place because CLASS
     considers this retrieval software a library application and would
     like to be able to look at material not only at Cornell but at other
     institutions

      The phrase "digital file copyright by Cornell University" was
     added at the advice of Cornells legal staff with the caveat that it
     probably would not hold up in court  Cornell does not want people
     to copy its books and sell them but would like to keep them
     available for use in a library environment for library purposes

      In production the scanner can scan about  pages per hour
     capturing  dots per inch

      The Xerox software has filters to scan halftone material and avoid
     the moire patterns that occur when halftone material is scanned
     Xerox has been working on hardware and software that would enable
     the scanner itself to recognize this situation and deal with it
     appropriatelya kind of autosegmentation that would enable the
     scanner to handle halftone material as well as text on a single page

      The books subjected to the elaborate process described above were
     selected because CLASS is a preservation project with the first 
     books selected coming from Cornells mathematics collection because
     they were still being heavily used and because although they were
     in need of preservation the mathematics library and the mathematics
     faculty were uncomfortable having them microfilmed  They wanted a
     printed copy  Thus these books became a logical choice for this
     project  Other books were chosen by the projects selection committees
     for experiments with the technology as well as to meet a demand or need

      Images will be decompressed before they are sent over the line at
     this time they are compressed and sent to the image filing system
     and then sent to the printer as compressed images they are returned
     to the workstation as compressed dpi images and the workstation
     decompresses and scales them for displayan inefficient way to
     access the material though it works quite well for printing and
     other purposes

      CLASS is also decompressing on Macintosh and IBM a slow process
     right now  Eventually compression and decompression will take
     place on an image conversion server  Tradeoffs will be made based
     on future performance testing concerning where the file is
     compressed and what resolution image is sent

      OCR has not been precluded images are being stored that have been
     scanned at a high resolution which presumably would suit them well
     to an OCR process  Because the material being scanned is about 
     years old and was printed with lessthanideal technologies very
     early and preliminary tests have not produced good results  But the
     project is capturing an image that is of sufficient resolution to be
     subjected to OCR in the future  Moreover the system architecture
     and the system plan have a logical place to store an OCR image if it
     has been captured  But that is not being done now

                                 

SESSION III  DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS AND NETWORKING  OPTIONS FOR
DISSEMINATION


ZICH  Issues pertaining to CDROMs  Options for publishing in CDROM 


Robert ZICH special assistant to the associate librarian for special
projects Library of Congress and moderator of this session first noted
the blessed but somewhat awkward circumstance of having four very
distinguished people representing networks and networking or at least
leaning in that direction while lacking anyone to speak from the
strongest possible background in CDROMs  ZICH expressed the hope that
members of the audience would join the discussion  He stressed the
subtitle of this particular session "Options for Dissemination" and
concerning CDROMs the importance of determining when it would be wise
to consider dissemination in CDROM versus networks  A shopping list of
issues pertaining to CDROMs included  the grounds for selecting
commercial publishers and inhouse publication where possible versus
nonprofit or government publication  A similar list for networks
included  determining when one should consider dissemination through a
network identifying the mechanisms or entities that exist to place items
on networks identifying the pool of existing networks determining how a
producer  would choose between networks and identifying the elements of
a business arrangement in a network

Options for publishing in CDROM  an outside publisher versus
selfpublication  If an outside publisher is used it can be nonprofit
such as the Government Printing Office GPO or the National Technical
Information Service NTIS in the case of government  The pros and cons
associated with employing an outside publisher are obvious  Among the
pros there is no trouble getting accepted  One pays the bill and in
effect goes ones way  Among the cons when one pays an outside
publisher to perform the work that publisher will perform the work it is
obliged to do but perhaps without the production expertise and skill in
marketing and dissemination that some would seek  There is the body of
commercial publishers that do possess that kind of expertise in
distribution and marketing but that obviously are selective  In
selfpublication one exercises full control but then one must handle
matters such as distribution and marketing  Such are some of the options
for publishing in the case of CDROM

In the case of technical and design issues which are also important
there are many matters which many at the Workshop already knew a good
deal about  retrieval system requirements and costs what to do about
images the various capabilities and platforms the tradeoffs between
cost and performance concerns about localarea networkability
interoperability etc

                                 


LYNCH  Creating networked information is different from using networks
as an access or dissemination vehicle  Networked multimedia on a large
scale does not yet work  Typical CDROM publication model a twoedged
sword  Publishing information on a CDROM in the present world of
immature standards  Contrast between CDROM and network pricing 
Examples demonstrated earlier in the day as a set of insular information
gems  Paramount need to link databases  Layering to become increasingly
necessary  Project NEEDS and the issues of information reuse and active
versus passive use  XWindows as a way of differentiating between
network access and networked information  Barriers to the distribution
of networked multimedia information  Need for good realtime delivery
protocols  The question of presentation integrity in clientserver
computing in the academic world  Recommendations for producing multimedia


Clifford LYNCH director Library Automation University of California
opened his talk with the general observation that networked information
constituted a difficult and elusive topic because it is something just
starting to develop and not yet fully understood  LYNCH contended that
creating genuinely networked information was different from using
networks as an access or dissemination vehicle and was more sophisticated
and more subtle  He invited the members of the audience to extrapolate
from what they heard about the preceding demonstration projects to what
sort of a world of electronics informationscholarly archival
cultural etcthey wished to end up with ten or fifteen years from now
LYNCH suggested that to extrapolate directly from these projects would
produce unpleasant results

Putting the issue of CDROM in perspective before getting into
generalities on networked information LYNCH observed that those engaged
in multimedia today who wish to ship a product so to say probably do
not have much choice except to use CDROM  networked multimedia on a
large scale basically does not yet work because the technology does not
exist  For example anybody who has tried moving images around over the
Internet knows that this is an exciting touchandgo process a
fascinating and fertile area for experimentation research and
development but not something that one can become deeply enthusiastic
about committing to production systems at this time

This situation will change LYNCH said  He differentiated CDROM from
the practices that have been followed up to now in distributing data on
CDROM  For LYNCH the problem with CDROM is not its portability or its
slowness but the twoedged sword of having the retrieval application and
the user interface inextricably bound up with the data which is the
typical CDROM publication model  It is not a case of publishing data
but of distributing a typically standalone typically closed system
allsoftware user interface and dataon a little disk  Hence all
the betweendisk navigational issues as well as the impossibility in most
cases of integrating data on one disk with that on another  Most CDROM
retrieval software does not network very gracefully at present  However
in the present world of immature standards and lack of understanding of
what network information is or what the ground rules are for creating or
using it publishing information on a CDROM does add value in a very
real sense

LYNCH drew a contrast between CDROM and network pricing and in doing so
highlighted something bizarre in information pricing  A large
institution such as the University of California has vendors who will
offer to sell information on CDROM for a price per year in four digits
but for the same data eg an abstracting and indexing database on
magnetic tape regardless of how many people may use it concurrently
will quote a price in six digits

What is packaged with the CDROM in one sense adds valuea complete
access system not just raw unrefined informationalthough it is not
generally perceived that way  This is because the access software
although it adds value is viewed by some people particularly in the
university environment where there is a very heavy commitment to
networking as being developed in the wrong direction

Given that context LYNCH described the examples demonstrated as a set of
insular information gemsPerseus for example offers nicely linked
information but would be very difficult to integrate with other
databases that is to link together seamlessly with other source files
from other sources  It resembles an island and in this respect is
similar to numerous standalone projects that are based on videodiscs
that is on the singleworkstation concept

As scholarship evolves in a network environment the paramount need will
be to link databases  We must link personal databases to public
databases to group databases in fairly seamless wayswhich is
extremely difficult in the environments under discussion with copies of
databases proliferating all over the place

The notion of layering also struck LYNCH as lurking in several of the
projects demonstrated  Several databases in a sense constitute
information archives without a significant amount of navigation built in
Educators critics and others will want a layered structureone that
defines or links paths through the layers to allow users to reach
specific points  In LYNCHs view layering will become increasingly
necessary and not just within a single resource but across resources
eg tracing mythology and cultural themes across several classics
databases as well as a database of Renaissance culture  This ability to
organize resources to build things out of multiple other things on the
network or select pieces of it represented for LYNCH one of the key
aspects of network information

Contending that information reuse constituted another significant issue
LYNCH commended to the audiences attention Project NEEDS ie National
Engineering Education Delivery System  This projects objective is to
produce a database of engineering courseware as well as the components
that can be used to develop new courseware  In a number of the existing
applications LYNCH said the issue of reuse how much one can take apart
and reuse in other applications was not being well considered  He also
raised the issue of active versus passive use one aspect of which  is
how much information will be manipulated locally by users  Most people
he argued may do a little browsing and then will wish to print  LYNCH
was uncertain how these resources would be used by the vast majority of
users in the network environment

LYNCH next said a few words about XWindows as a way of differentiating
between network access and networked information  A number of the
applications demonstrated at the Workshop could be rewritten to use X
across the network so that one could run them from any Xcapable device
a workstation an X terminaland transact with a database across the
network  Although this opens up access a little assuming one has enough
network to handle it it does not provide an interface to develop a
program that conveniently integrates information from multiple databases
X is a viewing technology that has limits  In a real sense it is just a
graphical version of remote login across the network  Xtype applications
represent only one step in the progression towards real access

LYNCH next discussed barriers to the distribution of networked multimedia
information  The heart of the problem is a lack of standards to provide
the ability for computers to talk to each other retrieve information
and shuffle it around fairly casually  At the moment little progress is
being made on standards for networked information for example present
standards do not cover images digital voice and digital video  A
useful tool kit of exchange formats for basic texts is only now being
assembled  The synchronization of content streams ie synchronizing a
voice track to a video track establishing temporal relations between
different components in a multimedia object constitutes another issue
for networked multimedia that is just beginning to receive attention

Underlying network protocols also need some work good realtime
delivery protocols on the Internet do not yet exist  In LYNCHs view
highly important in this context is the notion of networked digital
object IDs the ability of one object on the network to point to another
object or component thereof on the network  Serious bandwidth issues
also exist  LYNCH was uncertain if billionbitpersecond networks would
prove sufficient if numerous people ran video in parallel

LYNCH concluded by offering an issue for database creators to consider
as well as several comments about what might constitute good trial
multimedia experiments  In a networked information world the database
builder or service builder publisher does not exercise the same
extensive control over the integrity of the presentation strange
programs "munge" with ones data before the user sees it  Serious
thought must be given to what guarantees integrity of presentation  Part
of that is related to where one draws the boundaries around a networked
information service  This question of presentation integrity in
clientserver computing has not been stressed enough in the academic
world LYNCH argued though commercial service providers deal with it
regularly

Concerning multimedia LYNCH observed that good multimedia at the moment
is hideously expensive to produce  He recommended producing multimedia
with either very high sale value or multimedia with a very long life
span or multimedia that will have a very broad usage base and whose
costs therefore can be amortized among large numbers of users  In this
connection historical and humanistically oriented material may be a good
place to start because it tends to have a longer life span than much of
the scientific material as well as a wider user base  LYNCH noted for
example that American Memory fits many of the criteria outlined  He
remarked the extensive discussion about bringing the Internet or the
National Research and Education Network NREN into the K environment
as a way of helping the American educational system

LYNCH closed by noting that the kinds of applications demonstrated struck
him as excellent justifications of broadscale networking for K but
that at this time no "killer" application exists to mobilize the K
community to obtain connectivity

                                 


DISCUSSION  Dearth of genuinely interesting applications on the network
a slowchanging situation  The issue of the integrity of presentation in
a networked environment  Several reasons why CDROM software does not
network 


During the discussion period that followed LYNCHs presentation several
additional points were made

LYNCH reiterated even more strongly his contention that historically
once one goes outside highend science and the group of those who need
access to supercomputers there is a great dearth of genuinely
interesting applications on the network  He saw this situation changing
slowly with some of the scientific databases and scholarly discussion
groups and electronic journals coming on as well as with the availability
of Wide Area Information Servers WAIS and some of the databases that
are being mounted there  However many of those things do not seem to
have piqued great popular interest  For instance most high school
students of LYNCHs acquaintance would not qualify as devotees of serious
molecular biology

Concerning the issue of the integrity of presentation LYNCH believed
that a couple of information providers have laid down the law at least on
certain things  For example his recollection was that the National
Library of Medicine feels strongly that one needs to employ the
identifier field if he or she is to mount a database commercially  The
problem with a real networked environment is that one does not know who
is reformatting and reprocessing ones data when one enters a client
server mode  It becomes anybodys guess for example if the network
uses a Z server or what clients are doing with ones data  A data
provider can say that his contract will only permit clients to have
access to his data after he vets them and their presentation and makes
certain it suits him  But LYNCH held out little expectation that the
network marketplace would evolve in that way because it required too
much prior negotiation

CDROM software does not network for a variety of reasons LYNCH said
He speculated that CDROM publishers are not eager to have their products
really hook into wide area networks because they fear it will make their
data suppliers nervous  Moreover until relatively recently one had to
be rather adroit to run a full TCPIP stack plus applications on a
PCsize machine whereas nowadays it is becoming easier as PCs grow
bigger and faster  LYNCH also speculated that software providers had not
heard from their customers until the last year or so or had not heard
from enough of their customers

                                 


BESSER  Implications of disseminating images on the network planning
the distribution of multimedia documents poses two critical
implementation problems  Layered approach represents the way to deal
with users capabilities  Problems in platform design file size and its
implications for networking  Transmission of megabyte size images
impractical  Compression and decompression at the users end  Promising
trends for compression  A disadvantage of using XWindows  A project at
the Smithsonian that mounts images on several networks 


Howard BESSER School of Library and Information Science University of
Pittsburgh spoke primarily about multimedia focusing on images and the
broad implications of disseminating them on the network  He argued that
planning the distribution of multimedia documents posed two critical
implementation problems which he framed in the form of two questions
 What platform will one use and what hardware and software will users
have for viewing of the material?  and  How can one deliver a
sufficiently robust set of information in an accessible format in a
reasonable amount of time?  Depending on whether network or CDROM is the
medium used this question raises different issues of storage
compression and transmission

Concerning the design of platforms eg sound gray scale simple
color etc and the various capabilities users may have BESSER
maintained that a layered approach was the way to deal with users
capabilities  A result would be that users with less powerful
workstations would simply have less functionality  He urged members of
the audience to advocate standards and accompanying software that handle
layered functionality across a wide variety of platforms

BESSER also addressed problems in platform design namely deciding how
large a machine to design for situations when the largest number of users
have the lowest level of the machine and one desires higher
functionality  BESSER then proceeded to the question of file size and
its implications for networking  He discussed still images in the main
For example a digital color image that fills the screen of a standard
megapel workstation Sun or Next will require one megabyte of storage
for an eightbit image or three megabytes of storage for a true color or
twentyfourbit image  Lossless compression algorithms that is
computational procedures in which no data is lost in the process of
compressing and decompressing an imagethe exact bitrepresentation is
maintained might bring storage down to a third of a megabyte per image
but not much further than that  The question of size makes it difficult
to fit an appropriately sized set of these images on a single disk or to
transmit them quickly enough on a network

With these full screen megapel images that constitute a third of a
megabyte one gets  fullscreen images on a onegigabyte disk
a standard CDROM represents approximately  percent of that  Storing
images the size of a PC screen just  bit color increases storage
capacity to  images per gigabyte  percent of that gives
one the size of a CDROM which in turn creates a major problem  One
cannot have fullscreen fullcolor images with lossless compression one
must compress them or use a lower resolution  For megabytesize images
anything slower than a T speed is impractical  For example on a
fiftysixkilobaud line it takes three minutes to transfer a
onemegabyte file if it is not compressed and this speed assumes ideal
circumstances no other user contending for network bandwidth  Thus
questions of disk access remote display and current telephone
connection speed make transmission of megabytesize images impractical

BESSER then discussed ways to deal with these large images for example
compression and decompression at the users end  In this connection the
issues of how much one is willing to lose in the compression process and
what image quality one needs in the first place are unknown  But what is
known is that compression entails some loss of data  BESSER urged that
more studies be conducted on image quality in different situations for
example what kind of images are needed for what kind of disciplines and
what kind of image quality is needed for a browsing tool an intermediate
viewing tool and archiving

BESSER remarked two promising trends for compression  from a technical
perspective algorithms that use what is called subjective redundancy
employ principles from visual psychophysics to identify and remove
information from the image that the human eye cannot perceive from an
interchange and interoperability perspective the JPEG ie Joint
Photographic Experts Group an ISO standard compression algorithms also
offer promise  These issues of compression and decompression BESSER
argued resembled those raised earlier concerning the design of different
platforms  Gauging the capabilities of potential users constitutes a
primary goal  BESSER advocated layering or separating the images from
the applications that retrieve and display them to avoid tying them to
particular software

BESSER detailed several lessons learned from his work at Berkeley with
Imagequery especially the advantages and disadvantages of using
XWindows  In the latter category for example retrieval is tied
directly to ones data an intolerable situation in the long run on a
networked system  Finally BESSER described a project of Jim Wallace at
the Smithsonian Institution who is mounting images in a extremely
rudimentary way on the Compuserv and Genie networks and is preparing to
mount them on America On Line  Although the average user takes over
thirty minutes to download these images assuming a fairly fast modem
nevertheless images have been downloaded  times

BESSER concluded his talk with several comments on the business
arrangement between the Smithsonian and Compuserv  He contended that not
enough is known concerning the value of images

                                 


DISCUSSION  Creating digitized photographic collections nearly
impossible except with large organizations like museums  Need for study
to determine quality of images users will tolerate 


During the brief exchange between LESK and BESSER that followed several
clarifications emerged

LESK argued that the photographers were far ahead of BESSER  It is
almost impossible to create such digitized photographic collections
except with large organizations like museums because all the
photographic agencies have been going crazy about this and will not sign
licensing agreements on any sort of reasonable terms  LESK had heard
that National Geographic for example had tried to buy the right to use
some image in some kind of educational production for  per image but
the photographers will not touch it  They want accounting and payment
for each use which cannot be accomplished within the system  BESSER
responded that a consortium of photographers headed by a former National
Geographic photographer had started assembling its own collection of
electronic reproductions of images with the money going back to the
cooperative

LESK contended that BESSER was unnecessarily pessimistic about multimedia
images because people are accustomed to lowquality images particularly
from video  BESSER urged the launching of a study to determine what
users would tolerate what they would feel comfortable with and what
absolutely is the highest quality they would ever need  Conceding that
he had adopted a dire tone in order to arouse people about the issue
BESSER closed on a sanguine note by saying that he would not be in this
business if he did not think that things could be accomplished

                                 


LARSEN  Issues of scalability and modularity  Geometric growth of the
Internet and the role played by layering  Basic functions sustaining
this growth  A librarys roles and functions in a network environment 
Effects of implementation of the Z protocol for information
retrieval on the library system  The tradeoff between volumes of data
and its potential usage  A snapshot of current trends 


Ronald LARSEN associate director for information technology University
of Maryland at College Park first addressed the issues of scalability
and modularity  He noted the difficulty of anticipating the effects of
ordersofmagnitude growth reflecting on the twenty years of experience
with the Arpanet and Internet  Recalling the days demonstrations of
CDROM and optical disk material he went on to ask if the field has yet
learned how to scale new systems to enable delivery and dissemination
across largescale networks

LARSEN focused on the geometric growth of the Internet from its inception
circa  to the present and the adjustments required to respond to
that rapid growth  To illustrate the issue of scalability LARSEN
considered computer networks as including three generic components
computers network communication nodes and communication media  Each
component scales eg computers range from PCs to supercomputers
network nodes scale from interface cards in a PC through sophisticated
routers and gateways and communication media range from baud
dialup facilities through Mbps backbone links and eventually to
multigigabitpersecond communication lines and architecturally the
components are organized to scale hierarchically from local area networks
to internationalscale networks  Such growth is made possible by
building layers of communication protocols as BESSER pointed out
By layering both physically and logically a sense of scalability is
maintained from local area networks in offices across campuses through
bridges routers campus backbones fiberoptic links etc up into
regional networks and ultimately into national and international
networks

LARSEN then illustrated the geometric growth over a twoyear period
through September of the number of networks that comprise the
Internet  This growth has been sustained largely by the availability of
three basic functions  electronic mail file transfer ftp and remote
logon telnet  LARSEN also reviewed the growth in the kind of traffic
that occurs on the network  Network traffic reflects the joint contributions
of a larger population of users and increasing use per user  Today one sees
serious applications involving moving images across the networka rarity
ten years ago  LARSEN recalled and concurred with BESSERs main point
that the interesting problems occur at the application level

LARSEN then illustrated a model of a librarys roles and functions in a
network environment  He noted in particular the placement of online
catalogues onto the network and patrons obtaining access to the library
increasingly through local networks campus networks and the Internet
LARSEN supported LYNCHs earlier suggestion that we need to address
fundamental questions of networked information in order to build
environments that scale in the information sense as well as in the
physical sense

LARSEN supported the role of the library system as the access point into
the nations electronic collections  Implementation of the Z
protocol for information retrieval would make such access practical and
feasible  For example this would enable patrons in Maryland to search
California libraries or other libraries around the world that are
conformant with Z in a manner that is familiar to University of
Maryland patrons  This clientserver model also supports moving beyond
secondary content into primary content  The notion of how one links
from secondary content to primary content LARSEN said represents a
fundamental problem that requires rigorous thought  After noting
numerous network experiments in accessing fulltext materials including
projects supporting the ordering of materials across the network LARSEN
revisited the issue of transmitting highdensity highresolution color
images across the network and the large amounts of bandwidth they
require  He went on to address the bandwidth and synchronization
problems inherent in sending fullmotion video across the network

LARSEN illustrated the tradeoff between volumes of data in bytes or
orders of magnitude and the potential usage of that data  He discussed
transmission rates particularly the time it takes to move various forms
of information and what one could do with a network supporting
multigigabitpersecond transmission  At the moment the network
environment includes a composite of datatransmission requirements
volumes and forms going from steady to bursty highvolume and from
very slow to very fast  This aggregate must be considered in the design
construction and operation of multigigabyte networks

LARSENs objective is to use the networks and library systems now being
constructed to increase access to resources wherever they exist and
thus to evolve toward an online electronic virtual library

LARSEN concluded by offering a snapshot of current trends  continuing
geometric growth in network capacity and number of users slower
development of applications and glacial development and adoption of
standards  The challenge is to design and develop each new application
system with network access and scalability in mind

                                 


BROWNRIGG  Access to the Internet cannot be taken for granted  Packet
radio and the development of MELVYL in  in the Division of Library
Automation at the University of California    Design criteria for packet
radio  A demonstration project in San Diego and future plans  Spread
spectrum  Frequencies at which the radios will run and plans to
reimplement the WAIS server software in the public domain  Need for an
infrastructure of radios that do not move around 


Edwin BROWNRIGG executive director Memex Research Institute first
polled the audience in order to seek out regular users of the Internet as
well as those planning to use it some time in the future  With nearly
everybody in the room falling into one category or the other BROWNRIGG
made a point re access namely that numerous individuals especially those
who use the Internet every day take for granted their access to it the
speeds with which they are connected and how well it all works
However as BROWNRIGG discovered between  and  in Australia
if one wants access to the Internet but cannot afford it or has some
physical boundary that prevents her or him from gaining access it can
be extremely frustrating  He suggested that because of economics and
physical barriers we were beginning to create a world of haves and havenots
in the process of scholarly communication even in the United States

BROWNRIGG detailed the development of MELVYL in academic year  in
the Division of Library Automation at the University of California in
order to underscore the issue of access to the system which at the
outset was extremely limited  In short the project needed to build a
network which at that time entailed use of satellite technology that is
putting earth stations on campus and also acquiring some terrestrial links
from the State of Californias microwave system  The installation of
satellite links however did not solve the problem which actually
formed part of a larger problem involving politics and financial resources
For while the project team could get a signal onto a campus it had no means
of distributing the signal throughout the campus  The solution involved
adopting a recent development in wireless communication called packet radio
which combined the basic notion of packetswitching with radio  The project
used this technology to get the signal from a point on campus where it
came down an earth station for example into the libraries because it
found that wiring the libraries especially the older marble buildings
would cost  per terminal

BROWNRIGG noted that ten years ago the project had neither the public
policy nor the technology that would have allowed it to use packet radio
in any meaningful way  Since then much had changed  He proceeded to
detail research and development of the technology how it is being
deployed in California and what direction he thought it would take
The design criteria are to produce a highspeed onetime lowcost
highquality secure licensefree device packet radio that one can
plug in and play today forget about it and have access to the Internet
By high speed BROWNRIGG meant  megabyte and  megabytes  Those units
have been built he continued and are in the process of being
typecertified by an independent underwriting laboratory so that they can
be typelicensed by the Federal Communications Commission  As is the
case with citizens band one will be able to purchase a unit and not have
to worry about applying for a license

The basic idea BROWNRIGG elaborated is to take highspeed radio data
transmission and create a backbone network that at certain strategic
points in the network will "gateway" into a mediumspeed packet radio
ie one that runs at  kilobytes so that perhaps by 
people like those in the audience for the price of a VCR could purchase
a mediumspeed radio for the office or home have full network connectivity
to the Internet and partake of all its services with no need for an FCC
license and no regular bill from the local common carrier  BROWNRIGG
presented several details of a demonstration project currently taking
place in San Diego and described plans pending funding to install a
fullbore network in the San Francisco area  This network will have 
nodes running at backbone speeds and  of these nodes will be libraries
which in turn will be the gateway ports to the  kilobyte radios that
will give coverage for the neighborhoods surrounding the libraries

BROWNRIGG next explained Part  a new rule within Title  of the
Code of Federal Regulations enacted by the FCC in   This rule
challenged the industry which has only now risen to the occasion to
build a radio that would run at no more than one watt of output power and
use a fairly exotic method of modulating the radio wave called spread
spectrum  Spread spectrum in fact permits the building of networks so
that numerous data communications can occur simultaneously without
interfering with each other within the same wide radio channel

BROWNRIGG explained that the frequencies at which the radios would run
are very short wave signals  They are well above standard microwave and
radar  With a radio wave that small one watt becomes a tremendous punch
per bit and thus makes transmission at reasonable speed possible  In
order to minimize the potential for congestion the project is
undertaking to reimplement software which has been available in the
networking business and is taken for granted now for example TCPIP
routing algorithms bridges and gateways  In addition the project
plans to take the WAIS server software in the public domain and
reimplement it so that one can have a WAIS server on a Mac instead of a
Unix machine  The Memex Research Institute believes that libraries in
particular will want to use the WAIS servers with packet radio  This
project which has a team of about twelve people will run through 
and will include the  libraries already mentioned as well as other
professionals such as those in the medical profession engineering and
law  Thus the need is to create an infrastructure of radios that do not
move around which BROWNRIGG hopes will solve a problem not only for
libraries but for individuals who by and large today do not have access
to the Internet from their homes and offices
