Or works of God in Heaven air earth or sea
And all the riches of this world enjoyedst
And all the rule one empire only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith
Add virtue patience temperance add love
By name to come called charity the soul
Of all the rest then wilt thou not be loth
To leave this Paradise but shalt possess
A Paradise within thee happier far
Let us descend now therefore from this top
Of speculation for the hour precise
Exacts our parting hence and seethe guards
By me encamped on yonder hill expect
Their motion at whose front a flaming sword
In signal of remove waves fiercely round
We may no longer stay go waken Eve
Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed
Portending good and all her spirits composed
To meek submission thou at season fit
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard
Chiefly what may concern her faith to know
The great deliverance by her seed to come
For by the Womans seed on all mankind
That ye may live which will be many days
Both in one faith unanimous though sad
With cause for evils past yet much more cheered
With meditation on the happy end
He ended and they both descend the hill
Descended Adam to the bower where Eve
Lay sleeping ran before but found her waked
And thus with words not sad she him received
Whence thou returnest and whither wentest I know
For God is also in sleep and dreams advise
Which he hath sent propitious some great good
Presaging since with sorrow and hearts distress
Wearied I fell asleep  But now lead on
In me is no delay with thee to go
Is to stay here without thee here to stay
Is to go hence unwilling thou to me
Art all things under Heaven all places thou
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence
This further consolation yet secure
I carry hence though all by me is lost
Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore
So spake our mother Eve and Adam heard
Well pleased but answered not  For now too nigh
The ArchAngel stood and from the other hill
To their fixed station all in bright array
The Cherubim descended on the ground
Gliding meteorous as eveningmist
Risen from a river oer the marish glides
And gathers ground fast at the labourers heel
Homeward returning  High in front advanced
The brandished sword of God before them blazed
Fierce as a comet which with torrid heat
And vapour as the Libyan air adust
Began to parch that temperate clime whereat
In either hand the hastening Angel caught
Our lingering parents and to the eastern gate
Led them direct and down the cliff as fast
To the subjected plain then disappeared
They looking back all the eastern side beheld
Of Paradise so late their happy seat
Waved over by that flaming brand the gate
With dreadful faces thronged and fiery arms
Some natural tears they dropt but wiped them soon
The world was all before them where to choose
Their place of rest and Providence their guide
They hand in hand with wandering steps and slow
Through Eden took their solitary way

Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about one million dollars for each hour we work  One
hundred hours is a conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected entered proofread edited copyright
searched and analyzed the copyright letters written etc  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar then we produce a
million dollars per hour next year we will have to do four text
files per month thus upping our productivity to two millionhr
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December     x Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers

Afghanistan Economy

Overview
    Fundamentally Afghanistan is an extremely poor landlocked country highly
    dependent on farming wheat especially and livestock raising sheep and
    goats Economic considerations however have played second fiddle to
    political and military upheavals during more than  years of war including
    the nearly year Soviet military occupation which ended  February
     Over the past decade onethird of the population fled the country
    with Pakistan sheltering more than  million refugees and Iran about 
    million Another  million probably moved into and around urban areas within
    Afghanistan Although reliable data are unavailable gross domestic product
    is lower than  years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the
    disruption of trade and transport
