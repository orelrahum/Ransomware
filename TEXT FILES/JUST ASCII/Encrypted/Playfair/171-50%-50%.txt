The ark no more now floats but seems on ground
Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed
And now the tops of hills as rocks appear
With clamour thence the rapid currents drive
Towards the retreating sea their furious tide
Forthwith from out the ark a raven flies
And after him the surer messenger
A dove sent forth once and again to spy
Green tree or ground whereon his foot may light
The second time returning in his bill
An oliveleaf he brings pacifick sign
Anon dry ground appears and from his ark
The ancient sire descends with all his train
Then with uplifted hands and eyes devout
Grateful to Heaven over his head beholds
A dewy cloud and in the cloud a bow
Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay
Betokening peace from God and covenant new
Whereat the heart of Adam erst so sad
Greatly rejoiced and thus his joy broke forth
O thou who future things canst represent
As present heavenly Instructer  I revive
At this last sight assured that Man shall live
With all the creatures and their seed preserve
Far less I now lament for one whole world
Of wicked sons destroyed than I rejoice
For one man found so perfect and so just
That God vouchsafes to raise another world
From him and all his anger to forget
But say what mean those coloured streaks in Heaven
Distended as the brow of God appeased?
Or serve they as a flowery verge to bind
The fluid skirts of that same watery cloud
Lest it again dissolve and shower the earth?
To whom the ArchAngel  Dextrously thou aimest
So willingly doth God remit his ire
Though late repenting him of Man depraved
Grieved at his heart when looking down he saw
The whole earth filled with violence and all flesh
Corrupting each their way yet those removed
Such grace shall one just man find in his sight
That he relents not to blot out mankind
And makes a covenant never to destroy
The earth again by flood nor let the sea
Surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world
With man therein or beast but when he brings
Over the earth a cloud will therein set
His triplecoloured bow whereon to look
And call to mind his covenant Day and night
Seedtime and harvest heat and hoary frost
Shall hold their course till fire purge all things new
Both Heaven and Earth wherein the just shall dwell



Book XII


As one who in his journey bates at noon
Though bent on speed so here the ArchAngel paused
Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose
Then with transition sweet new speech resumes
Thus thou hast seen one world begin and end
And Man as from a second stock proceed
Much thou hast yet to see but I perceive
Thy mortal sight to fail objects divine
Must needs impair and weary human sense
Henceforth what is to come I will relate
Thou therefore give due audience and attend
This second source of Men while yet but few
And while the dread of judgement past remains
Fresh in their minds fearing the Deity
With some regard to what is just and right
Shall lead their lives and multiply apace
Labouring the soil and reaping plenteous crop
Corn wine and oil and from the herd or flock
Oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid
With large wineofferings poured and sacred feast
Shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell
Long time in peace by families and tribes
Under paternal rule till one shall rise
Of proud ambitious heart who not content
With fair equality fraternal state
Will arrogate dominion undeserved
Over his brethren and quite dispossess
Concord and law of nature from the earth
Hunting and men not beasts shall be his game
With war and hostile snare such as refuse
Subjection to his empire tyrannous
A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled
Before the Lord as in despite of Heaven
Or from Heaven claiming second sovranty
And from rebellion shall derive his name
Though of rebellion others he accuse
He with a crew whom like ambition joins
With him or under him to tyrannize
Marching from Eden towards the west shall find
The plain wherein a black bituminous gurge
Boils out from under ground the mouth of Hell
Of brick and of that stuff they cast to build
A city and tower whose top may reach to Heaven
And get themselves a name lest far dispersed
In foreign lands their memory be lost
Regardless whether good or evil fame
But God who oft descends to visit men
Unseen and through their habitations walks
To mark their doings them beholding soon
Comes down to see their city ere the tower
Obstruct Heaventowers and in derision sets
Upon their tongues a various spirit to rase
Quite out their native language and instead
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud
Among the builders each to other calls
Not understood till hoarse and all in rage
As mocked they storm great laughter was in Heaven
And looking down to see the hubbub strange
And hear the din  Thus was the building left
Ridiculous and the work Confusion named
Whereto thus Adam fatherly displeased
O execrable son so to aspire
Above his brethren to himself assuming
Authority usurped from God not given
He gave us only over beast fish fowl
Dominion absolute that right we hold
By his donation but man over men
He made not lord such title to himself
Reserving human left from human free
But this usurper his encroachment proud
Stays not on Man to God his tower intends
Siege and defiance  Wretched manwhat food
Will he convey up thither to sustain
Himself and his rash army where thin air
Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross
And famish him of breath if not of bread?
To whom thus Michael  Justly thou abhorrest
That son who on the quiet state of men
Such trouble brought affecting to subdue
Rational liberty yet know withal
Since thy original lapse true liberty
Is lost which always with right reason dwells
Twinned and from her hath no dividual being
Reason in man obscured or not obeyed
Immediately inordinate desires
And upstart passions catch the government
From reason and to servitude reduce
Man till then free  Therefore since he permits
Within himself unworthy powers to reign
Over free reason God in judgement just
Subjects him from without to violent lords
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
His outward freedom  Tyranny must be
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low
From virtue which is reason that no wrong
But justice and some fatal curse annexed
Deprives them of their outward liberty
Their inward lost  Witness the irreverent son
Of him who built the ark who for the shame
Done to his father heard this heavy curse
Servant of servants on his vicious race
Thus will this latter as the former world
Still tend from bad to worse till God at last
Wearied with their iniquities withdraw
His presence from among them and avert
His holy eyes resolving from thenceforth
To leave them to their own polluted ways
And one peculiar nation to select
From all the rest of whom to be invoked
A nation from one faithful man to spring
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing
Bred up in idolworship  O that men
Canst thou believe? should be so stupid grown
While yet the patriarch lived who scaped the flood
As to forsake the living God and fall
To worship their own work in wood and stone
For Gods  Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes
To call by vision from his fathers house
His kindred and false Gods into a land
Which he will show him and from him will raise
A mighty nation and upon him shower
His benediction so that in his seed
All nations shall be blest he straight obeys
Not knowing to what land yet firm believes
I see him but thou canst not with what faith
He leaves his Gods his friends and native soil
Ur of Chaldaea passing now the ford
To Haran after him a cumbrous train
Of herds and flocks and numerous servitude
Not wandering poor but trusting all his wealth
With God who called him in a land unknown
Canaan he now attains I see his tents
Pitched about Sechem and the neighbouring plain
Of Moreh there by promise he receives
Gift to his progeny of all that land
From Hameth northward to the Desart south
Things by their names I call though yet unnamed
From Hermon east to the great western Sea
Mount Hermon yonder sea each place behold
In prospect as I point them on the shore
Mount Carmel here the doublefounted stream
Jordan true limit eastward but his sons
Shall dwell to Senir that long ridge of hills
This ponder that all nations of the earth
Shall in his seed be blessed  By that seed
Is meant thy great Deliverer who shall bruise
The Serpents head whereof to thee anon
Plainlier shall be revealed  This patriarch blest
Whom faithful Abraham due time shall call
A son and of his son a grandchild leaves
Like him in faith in wisdom and renown
The grandchild with twelve sons increased departs
From Canaan to a land hereafter called
Egypt divided by the river Nile
See where it flows disgorging at seven mouths
Into the sea To sojourn in that land
He comes invited by a younger son
In time of dearth a son whose worthy deeds
Raise him to be the second in that realm
Of Pharaoh There he dies and leaves his race
Growing into a nation and now grown
Suspected to a sequent king who seeks
To stop their overgrowth as inmate guests
Too numerous whence of guests he makes them slaves
Inhospitably and kills their infant males
Till by two brethren these two brethren call
Moses and Aaron sent from God to claim
His people from enthralment they return
With glory and spoil back to their promised land
But first the lawless tyrant who denies
To know their God or message to regard
Must be compelled by signs and judgements dire
To blood unshed the rivers must be turned
Frogs lice and flies must all his palace fill
With loathed intrusion and fill all the land
His cattle must of rot and murren die
Botches and blains must all his flesh emboss
And all his people thunder mixed with hail
Hail mixed with fire must rend the Egyptians sky
And wheel on the earth devouring where it rolls
What it devours not herb or fruit or grain
A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down
Must eat and on the ground leave nothing green
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds
Palpable darkness and blot out three days
Last with one midnight stroke all the firstborn
Of Egypt must lie dead  Thus with ten wounds
The riverdragon tamed at length submits
To let his sojourners depart and oft
Humbles his stubborn heart but still as ice
More hardened after thaw till in his rage
Pursuing whom he late dismissed the sea
Swallows him with his host but them lets pass
As on dry land between two crystal walls
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand
Divided till his rescued gain their shore
Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend
Though present in his Angel who shall go
Before them in a cloud and pillar of fire
By day a cloud by night a pillar of fire
To guide them in their journey and remove
Behind them while the obdurate king pursues
All night he will pursue but his approach
Darkness defends between till morning watch
Then through the fiery pillar and the cloud
God looking forth will trouble all his host
And craze their chariotwheels when by command
Moses once more his potent rod extends
Over the sea the sea his rod obeys
On their embattled ranks the waves return
And overwhelm their war  The race elect
Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance
Through the wild Desart not the readiest way
Lest entering on the Canaanite alarmed
War terrify them inexpert and fear
Return them back to Egypt choosing rather
Inglorious life with servitude for life
To noble and ignoble is more sweet
Untrained in arms where rashness leads not on
This also shall they gain by their delay
In the wide wilderness there they shall found
Their government and their great senate choose
Through the twelve tribes to rule by laws ordained
God from the mount of Sinai whose gray top
Shall tremble he descending will himself
In thunder lightning and loud trumpets sound
Ordain them laws part such as appertain
To civil justice part religious rites
Of sacrifice informing them by types
And shadows of that destined Seed to bruise
The Serpent by what means he shall achieve
Mankinds deliverance  But the voice of God
To mortal ear is dreadful  They beseech
That Moses might report to them his will
And terrour cease he grants what they besought
Instructed that to God is no access
Without Mediator whose high office now
Moses in figure bears to introduce
One greater of whose day he shall foretel
And all the Prophets in their age the times
Of great Messiah shall sing  Thus laws and rites
Established such delight hath God in Men
Obedient to his will that he vouchsafes
Among them to set up his tabernacle
The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed
Of cedar overlaid with gold therein
An ark and in the ark his testimony
The records of his covenant over these
A mercyseat of gold between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim before him burn
Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing
The heavenly fires over the tent a cloud
Shall rest by day a fiery gleam by night
Save when they journey and at length they come
Conducted by his Angel to the land
Promised to Abraham and his seedThe rest
Were long to tell how many battles fought
How many kings destroyed and kingdoms won
Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still
A day entire and nights due course adjourn
Mans voice commanding Sun in Gibeon stand
And thou moon in the vale of Aialon
Till Israel overcome so call the third
From Abraham son of Isaac and from him
His whole descent who thus shall Canaan win
Here Adam interposed  O sent from Heaven
Enlightener of my darkness gracious things
Thou hast revealed those chiefly which concern
Just Abraham and his seed now first I find
Mine eyes trueopening and my heart much eased
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts what would become
Of me and all mankind  But now I see
His day in whom all nations shall be blest
Favour unmerited by me who sought
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means
This yet I apprehend not why to those
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth
So many and so various laws are given
So many laws argue so many sins
Among them how can God with such reside?
To whom thus Michael  Doubt not but that sin
Will reign among them as of thee begot
And therefore was law given them to evince
Their natural pravity by stirring up
Sin against law to fight that when they see
Law can discover sin but not remove
Save by those shadowy expiations weak
The blood of bulls and goats they may conclude
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man
Just for unjust that in such righteousness
To them by faith imputed they may find
Justification towards God and peace
Of conscience which the law by ceremonies
Cannot appease nor Man the mortal part
Perform and not performing cannot live
So law appears imperfect and but given
With purpose to resign them in full time
Up to a better covenant disciplined
From shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit
From imposition of strict laws to free
Acceptance of large grace from servile fear
To filial works of law to works of faith
And therefore shall not Moses though of God
Highly beloved being but the minister
Of law his people into Canaan lead
But Joshua whom the Gentiles Jesus call
His name and office bearing who shall quell
The adversarySerpent and bring back
Through the worlds wilderness longwandered Man
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest
Mean while they in their earthly Canaan placed
Long time shall dwell and prosper but when sins
National interrupt their publick peace
Provoking God to raise them enemies
From whom as oft he saves them penitent
By Judges first then under Kings of whom
The second both for piety renowned
And puissant deeds a promise shall receive
Irrevocable that his regal throne
For ever shall endure the like shall sing
All Prophecy that of the royal stock
Of David so I name this king shall rise
A Son the Womans seed to thee foretold
Foretold to Abraham as in whom shall trust
All nations and to kings foretold of kings
The last for of his reign shall be no end
But first a long succession must ensue
And his next son for wealth and wisdom famed
The clouded ark of God till then in tents
Wandering shall in a glorious temple enshrine
Such follow him as shall be registered
Part good part bad of bad the longer scroll
Whose foul idolatries and other faults
Heaped to the popular sum will so incense
God as to leave them and expose their land
Their city his temple and his holy ark
With all his sacred things a scorn and prey
To that proud city whose high walls thou sawest
Left in confusion Babylon thence called
There in captivity he lets them dwell
The space of seventy years then brings them back
Remembering mercy and his covenant sworn
To David stablished as the days of Heaven
Returned from Babylon by leave of kings
Their lords whom God disposed the house of God
They first reedify and for a while
In mean estate live moderate till grown
In wealth and multitude factious they grow
But first among the priests dissention springs
Men who attend the altar and should most
Endeavour peace their strife pollution brings
Upon the temple itself at last they seise
The scepter and regard not Davids sons
Then lose it to a stranger that the true
Anointed King Messiah might be born
Barred of his right yet at his birth a star
Unseen before in Heaven proclaims him come
And guides the eastern sages who inquire
His place to offer incense myrrh and gold
His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
To simple shepherds keeping watch by night
They gladly thither haste and by a quire
Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung
A virgin is his mother but his sire
The power of the Most High  He shall ascend
The throne hereditary and bound his reign
With Earths wide bounds his glory with the Heavens
He ceased discerning Adam with such joy
Surcharged as had like grief been dewed in tears
Without the vent of words which these he breathed
O prophet of glad tidings finisher
Of utmost hope now clear I understand
What oft my steadiest thoughts have searched in vain
Why our great Expectation should be called
The seed of Woman  Virgin Mother hail
High in the love of Heaven yet from my loins
Thou shalt proceed and from thy womb the Son
Of God Most High so God with Man unites
Needs must the Serpent now his capital bruise
Expect with mortal pain  Say where and when
Their fight what stroke shall bruise the victors heel
To whom thus Michael  Dream not of their fight
As of a duel or the local wounds
Of head or heel  Not therefore joins the Son
Manhood to Godhead with more strength to foil
Thy enemy nor so is overcome
Satan whose fall from Heaven a deadlier bruise
Disabled not to give thee thy deaths wound
Which he who comes thy Saviour shall recure
Not by destroying Satan but his works
In thee and in thy seed  Nor can this be
But by fulfilling that which thou didst want
Obedience to the law of God imposed
On penalty of death and suffering death
The penalty to thy transgression due
And due to theirs which out of thine will grow
So only can high Justice rest appaid
The law of God exact he shall fulfil
Both by obedience and by love though love
Alone fulfil the law thy punishment
He shall endure by coming in the flesh
To a reproachful life and cursed death
Proclaiming life to all who shall believe
In his redemption and that his obedience
Imputed becomes theirs by faith his merits
To save them not their own though legal works
For this he shall live hated be blasphemed
Seised on by force judged and to death condemned
A shameful and accursed nailed to the cross
By his own nation slain for bringing life
But to the cross he nails thy enemies
The law that is against thee and the sins
Of all mankind with him there crucified
Never to hurt them more who rightly trust
In this his satisfaction so he dies
But soon revives Death over him no power
Shall long usurp ere the third dawning light
Return the stars of morn shall see him rise
Out of his grave fresh as the dawning light
Thy ransom paid which Man from death redeems
His death for Man as many as offered life
Neglect not and the benefit embrace
By faith not void of works  This Godlike act
Annuls thy doom the death thou shouldest have died
In sin for ever lost from life this act
Shall bruise the head of Satan crush his strength
Defeating Sin and Death his two main arms
And fix far deeper in his head their stings
Than temporal death shall bruise the victors heel
Or theirs whom he redeems a death like sleep
A gentle wafting to immortal life
Nor after resurrection shall he stay
Longer on earth than certain times to appear
To his disciples men who in his life
Still followed him to them shall leave in charge
To teach all nations what of him they learned
And his salvation them who shall believe
Baptizing in the profluent stream the sign
Of washing them from guilt of sin to life
Pure and in mind prepared if so befall
For death like that which the Redeemer died
All nations they shall teach for from that day
Not only to the sons of Abrahams loins
Salvation shall be preached but to the sons
Of Abrahams faith wherever through the world
So in his seed all nations shall be blest
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend
With victory triumphing through the air
Over his foes and thine there shall surprise
The Serpent prince of air and drag in chains
Through all his realm and there confounded leave
Then enter into glory and resume
His seat at Gods right hand exalted high
Above all names in Heaven and thence shall come
When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe
With glory and power to judge both quick and dead
To judge the unfaithful dead but to reward
His faithful and receive them into bliss
Whether in Heaven or Earth for then the Earth
Shall all be Paradise far happier place
Than this of Eden and far happier days
So spake the ArchAngel Michael then paused
As at the worlds great period and our sire
Replete with joy and wonder thus replied
O Goodness infinite Goodness immense
That all this good of evil shall produce
And evil turn to good more wonderful
Than that which by creation first brought forth
Light out of darkness  Full of doubt I stand
Whether I should repent me now of sin
By me done and occasioned or rejoice
Much more that much more good thereof shall spring
To God more glory more goodwill to Men
From God and over wrath grace shall abound
But say if our Deliverer up to Heaven
Must reascend what will betide the few
His faithful left among the unfaithful herd
The enemies of truth?  Who then shall guide
His people who defend?  Will they not deal
Worse with his followers than with him they dealt?
Be sure they will said the Angel but from Heaven
He to his own a Comforter will send
The promise of the Father who shall dwell
His Spirit within them and the law of faith
Working through love upon their hearts shall write
To guide them in all truth and also arm
With spiritual armour able to resist
Satans assaults and quench his fiery darts
What man can do against them not afraid
Though to the death against such cruelties
With inward consolations recompensed
And oft supported so as shall amaze
Their proudest persecutors  For the Spirit
Poured first on his Apostles whom he sends
To evangelize the nations then on all
Baptized shall them with wonderous gifts endue
To speak all tongues and do all miracles
As did their Lord before them  Thus they win
Great numbers of each nation to receive
With joy the tidings brought from Heaven  At length
Their ministry performed and race well run
Their doctrine and their story written left
They die but in their room as they forewarn
Wolves shall succeed for teachers grievous wolves
Who all the sacred mysteries of Heaven
To their own vile advantages shall turn
Of lucre and ambition and the truth
With superstitions and traditions taint
Left only in those written records pure
Though not but by the Spirit understood
Then shall they seek to avail themselves of names
Places and titles and with these to join
Secular power though feigning still to act
By spiritual to themselves appropriating
The Spirit of God promised alike and given
To all believers and from that pretence
Spiritual laws by carnal power shall force
On every conscience laws which none shall find
Left them inrolled or what the Spirit within
Shall on the heart engrave  What will they then
But force the Spirit of Grace itself and bind
His consort Liberty? what but unbuild
His living temples built by faith to stand
Their own faith not anothers? for on earth
Who against faith and conscience can be heard
Infallible? yet many will presume
Whence heavy persecution shall arise
On all who in the worship persevere
Of spirit and truth the rest far greater part
Will deem in outward rites and specious forms
Religion satisfied Truth shall retire
Bestuck with slanderous darts and works of faith
Rarely be found  So shall the world go on
To good malignant to bad men benign
Under her own weight groaning till the day
Appear of respiration to the just
And vengeance to the wicked at return
Of him so lately promised to thy aid
The Womans Seed obscurely then foretold
Now ampler known thy Saviour and thy Lord
Last in the clouds from Heaven to be revealed
In glory of the Father to dissolve
Satan with his perverted world then raise
From the conflagrant mass purged and refined
New Heavens new Earth ages of endless date
Founded in righteousness and peace and love
To bring forth fruits joy and eternal bliss
