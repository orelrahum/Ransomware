    years of strong economic expansion which had raised national output by one
    quarter Britains inflation rate which has been consistently well above
    those of her major trading partners declined significantly in  Between
     and  unemployment fell from  to about  but crept back up to
     in  because of the economic slowdown As a major trading nation the
