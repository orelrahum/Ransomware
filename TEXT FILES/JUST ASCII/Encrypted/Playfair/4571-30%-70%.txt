thus to evolve toward an online electronic virtual library

LARSEN concluded by offering a snapshot of current trends  continuing
geometric growth in network capacity and number of users slower
development of applications and glacial development and adoption of

Edwin BROWNRIGG executive director Memex Research Institute first
polled the audience in order to seek out regular users of the Internet as
well as those planning to use it some time in the future  With nearly
everybody in the room falling into one category or the other BROWNRIGG
made a point re access namely that numerous individuals especially those
who use the Internet every day take for granted their access to it the
speeds with which they are connected and how well it all works
However as BROWNRIGG discovered between  and  in Australia
if one wants access to the Internet but cannot afford it or has some
physical boundary that prevents her or him from gaining access it can
be extremely frustrating  He suggested that because of economics and
physical barriers we were beginning to create a world of haves and havenots
in the process of scholarly communication even in the United States

BROWNRIGG detailed the development of MELVYL in academic year  in
the Division of Library Automation at the University of California in
order to underscore the issue of access to the system which at the
outset was extremely limited  In short the project needed to build a
network which at that time entailed use of satellite technology that is
putting earth stations on campus and also acquiring some terrestrial links
from the State of Californias microwave system  The installation of
satellite links however did not solve the problem which actually
formed part of a larger problem involving politics and financial resources
For while the project team could get a signal onto a campus it had no means
of distributing the signal throughout the campus  The solution involved
adopting a recent development in wireless communication called packet radio
which combined the basic notion of packetswitching with radio  The project
used this technology to get the signal from a point on campus where it
came down an earth station for example into the libraries because it
found that wiring the libraries especially the older marble buildings
would cost  per terminal

BROWNRIGG noted that ten years ago the project had neither the public
policy nor the technology that would have allowed it to use packet radio
in any meaningful way  Since then much had changed  He proceeded to
detail research and development of the technology how it is being
deployed in California and what direction he thought it would take
The design criteria are to produce a highspeed onetime lowcost
highquality secure licensefree device packet radio that one can
plug in and play today forget about it and have access to the Internet
By high speed BROWNRIGG meant  megabyte and  megabytes  Those units
have been built he continued and are in the process of being
typecertified by an independent underwriting laboratory so that they can
be typelicensed by the Federal Communications Commission  As is the
case with citizens band one will be able to purchase a unit and not have
to worry about applying for a license

The basic idea BROWNRIGG elaborated is to take highspeed radio data
transmission and create a backbone network that at certain strategic
points in the network will "gateway" into a mediumspeed packet radio
ie one that runs at  kilobytes so that perhaps by 
people like those in the audience for the price of a VCR could purchase
a mediumspeed radio for the office or home have full network connectivity
to the Internet and partake of all its services with no need for an FCC
license and no regular bill from the local common carrier  BROWNRIGG
presented several details of a demonstration project currently taking
place in San Diego and described plans pending funding to install a
fullbore network in the San Francisco area  This network will have 
nodes running at backbone speeds and  of these nodes will be libraries
which in turn will be the gateway ports to the  kilobyte radios that
will give coverage for the neighborhoods surrounding the libraries

BROWNRIGG next explained Part  a new rule within Title  of the
Code of Federal Regulations enacted by the FCC in   This rule
challenged the industry which has only now risen to the occasion to
build a radio that would run at no more than one watt of output power and
use a fairly exotic method of modulating the radio wave called spread
spectrum  Spread spectrum in fact permits the building of networks so
that numerous data communications can occur simultaneously without
interfering with each other within the same wide radio channel

BROWNRIGG explained that the frequencies at which the radios would run
are very short wave signals  They are well above standard microwave and
radar  With a radio wave that small one watt becomes a tremendous punch
per bit and thus makes transmission at reasonable speed possible  In
order to minimize the potential for congestion the project is
undertaking to reimplement software which has been available in the
networking business and is taken for granted now for example TCPIP
routing algorithms bridges and gateways  In addition the project
plans to take the WAIS server software in the public domain and
reimplement it so that one can have a WAIS server on a Mac instead of a
Unix machine  The Memex Research Institute believes that libraries in
particular will want to use the WAIS servers with packet radio  This
project which has a team of about twelve people will run through 
and will include the  libraries already mentioned as well as other
professionals such as those in the medical profession engineering and
law  Thus the need is to create an infrastructure of radios that do not
move around which BROWNRIGG hopes will solve a problem not only for
libraries but for individuals who by and large today do not have access
to the Internet from their homes and offices

                                 


DISCUSSION  Project operating frequencies 


During a brief discussion period which also concluded the days
proceedings BROWNRIGG stated that the project was operating in four
frequencies  The slow speed is operating at  megahertz and it would
later go up to  megahertz  With the highspeed frequency the
onemegabyte radios will run at  gigabits and  will run at 
At  rain can be a factor but it would have to be tropical rain
unlike what falls in most parts of the United States

                                 

SESSION IV  IMAGE CAPTURE TEXT CAPTURE OVERVIEW OF TEXT AND
             IMAGE STORAGE FORMATS

William HOOTON vice president of operations INET moderated this session


KENNEY  Factors influencing development of CXP  Advantages of using
digital technology versus photocopy and microfilm  A primary goal of
CXP publishing challenges  Characteristics of copies printed  Quality
of samples achieved in image capture  Several factors to be considered
in choosing scanning  Emphasis of CXP on timely and costeffective
production of blackandwhite printed facsimiles  Results of producing
microfilm from digital files  Advantages of creating microfilm  Details
concerning production  Costs  Role of digital technology in library
preservation 


Anne KENNEY associate director Department of Preservation and
Conservation Cornell University opened her talk by observing that the
Cornell Xerox Project CXP has been guided by the assumption that the
ability to produce printed facsimiles or to replace paper with paper
would be important at least for the present generation of users and
equipment  She described three factors that influenced development of
the project   Because the project has emphasized the preservation of
deteriorating brittle books the quality of what was produced had to be
sufficiently high to return a paper replacement to the shelf  CXP was
only interested in using   a system that was costeffective which
meant that it had to be costcompetitive with the processes currently
available principally photocopy and microfilm and  new or currently
available product hardware and software

KENNEY described the advantages that using digital technology offers over
both photocopy and microfilm   The potential exists to create a higher
quality reproduction of a deteriorating original than conventional
lightlens technology   Because a digital image is an encoded
representation it can be reproduced again and again with no resulting
loss of quality as opposed to the situation with lightlens processes
in which there is discernible difference between a second and a
subsequent generation of an image   A digital image can be manipulated
in a number of ways to improve image capture for example Xerox has
developed a windowing application that enables one to capture a page
containing both text and illustrations in a manner that optimizes the
reproduction of both  With lightlens technology one must choose which
to optimize text or the illustration in preservation microfilming the
current practice is to shoot an illustrated page twice once to highlight
the text and the second time to provide the best capture for the
illustration   A digital image can also be edited density levels
adjusted to remove underlining and stains and to increase legibility for
faint documents   Onscreen inspection can take place at the time of
initial setup and adjustments made prior to scanning factors that
substantially reduce the number of retakes required in quality control

A primary goal of CXP has been to evaluate the paper output printed on
the Xerox DocuTech a highspeed printer that produces dpi pages from
scanned images at a rate of  pages a minute  KENNEY recounted several
publishing challenges to represent faithful and legible reproductions of
the originals that the dpi copy for the most part successfully
captured  For example many of the deteriorating volumes in the project
were heavily illustrated with fine line drawings or halftones or came in
languages such as Japanese in which the buildup of characters comprised
of varying strokes is difficult to reproduce at lower resolutions a
surprising number of them came with annotations and mathematical
formulas which it was critical to be able to duplicate exactly

KENNEY noted that  the copies are being printed on paper that meets the
ANSI standards for performance  the DocuTech printer meets the machine
and toner requirements for proper adhesion of print to page as described
by the National Archives and thus  paper product is considered to be
the archival equivalent of preservation photocopy

KENNEY then discussed several samples of the quality achieved in the
project that had been distributed in a handout for example a copy of a
printondemand version of the  Reed lecture on the steam turbine
which contains halftUWSP VURA RCYNUDPV LAK DXVHLPCQFHIRL QHSQWVKR UD
