Croatia Economy

Overview
    Before the political disintegration of Yugoslavia the republic of Croatia
    stood next to Slovenia as the most prosperous and industrialized area with
    a per capita output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps
    onethird above the Yugoslav average Serbia and the Serbdominated army of
    the old Yugoslavia however have seized Croatian territory and the
    overriding determinant of Croatias longterm economic prospects will be the
    final border settlement Under the most favorable circumstances Croatia
    will retain the Dalmatian coast with its major tourist attractions and
    Slavonia with its oilfields and rich agricultural land Even so Croatia
    would face monumental problems stemming from the legacy of longtime
    Communist mismanagement of the economy large foreign debt damage during
    the fighting to bridges factories powerlines buildings and houses and
    the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav
    republics At the minimum extensive Western aid and investment especially
    in the tourist and oil industries would seem necessary to salvage a
    desperate economic situation However peace and political stability must
    come first

Croatia Economy

Agriculture
    Croatia normally produces a food surplus most agricultural land in private
    hands and concentrated in Croatmajority districts in Slavonia and Istria
    much of Slavonias land has been put out of production by fighting wheat
    corn sugar beets sunflowers alfalfa and clover are main crops in
    Slavonia central Croatian highlands are less fertile but support cereal

Cuba Economy

Overview
    The economy centrally planned and largely state owned is highly dependent
    on the agricultural sector and foreign trade Sugar provided about
    twothirds of export revenues in  and over half was exported to the
    former Soviet republics The economy has stagnated since  under policies
    that have deemphasized material incentives in the workplace abolished
    farmers informal produce markets and raised prices of governmentsupplied
    goods and services In  the economy probably fell  largely as a result
    of declining trade with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe Recently
    the government has been trying to increase trade with LatUD QUSEMDY LWR
