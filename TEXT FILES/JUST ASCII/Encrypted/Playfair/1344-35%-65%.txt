    been devastated by widespread political instability mismanagement and

    economy employing over  of the work force Coffee is the major export
    crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues Since  the government
    has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency
    reform raising producer prices on export crops increasing petroleum
    prices and improving civil service wages The policy changes are especially
    aimed at dampening inflation which was running at over  in  and

    economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
    rehabilitation of infrastructure improved incentives for production and
    exports and gradually improving domestic security
