  I dare say youre wondering why I dont put my arm round your
waist the Duchess said after a pause  the reason is that Im
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo  Shall I try the
experiment?

  HE might bite Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all
anxious to have the experiment tried

  Very true said the Duchess  flamingoes and mustard both
bite  And the moral of that is"Birds of a feather flock
together"

  Only mustard isnt a bird Alice remarked

  Right as usual said the Duchess  what a clear way you
have of putting things

  Its a mineral I THINK said Alice

  Of course it is said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree
to everything that Alice said theres a large mustardmine near
here  And the moral of that is"The more there is of mine the
less there is of yours"

  Oh I know exclaimed Alice who had not attended to this
last remark its a vegetable  It doesnt look like one but it
is

  I quite agree with you said the Duchess and the moral of
that is"Be what you would seem to be"or if youd like it put
more simply"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than
what it might appear to others that what you were or might have
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared
to them to be otherwise"

  I think I should understand that better Alice said very
politely if I had it written down  but I cant quite follow it
as you say it

  Thats nothing to what I could say if I chose the Duchess
replied in a pleased tone

  Pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that
said Alice

  Oh dont talk about trouble said the Duchess  I make you
a present of everything Ive said as yet

  A cheap sort of present thought Alice  Im glad they dont
give birthday presents like that  But she did not venture to
say it out loud

  Thinking again? the Duchess asked with another dig of her
sharp little chin

  Ive a right to think said Alice sharply for she was
beginning to feel a little worried

  Just about as much right said the Duchess as pigs have to
fly and the m

  But here to Alices great surprise the Duchesss voice died
away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble  Alice looked up
and there stood the Queen in front of them with her arms folded
frowning like a thunderstorm

  A fine day your Majesty the Duchess began in a low weak
voice

  Now I give you fair warning shouted the Queen stamping on
the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off
and that in about half no time  Take your choice

  The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment

  Lets go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and Alice
was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her
back to the croquetground

  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queens absence
and were resting in the shade  however the moment they saw her
they hurried back to the game the Queen merely remarking that a
moments delay would cost them their lives

  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off
quarrelling with the other players and shouting Off with his
head or Off with her head  Those whom she sentenced were
taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave
off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour
or so there were no arches left and all the players except the
King the Queen and Alice were in custody and under sentence of
execution

  Then the Queen left off quite out of breath and said to
Alice Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?

  No said Alice  I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is

  Its the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from said the Queen

  I never saw one or heard of one said Alice

  Come on then said the Queen and he shall tell you his
history

  As they walked off together Alice heard the King say in a low
voice to the company generally You are all pardoned  Come
THATS a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite
unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered

  They very soon came upon a Gryphon lying fast asleep in the
sun  IF you dont know what a Gryphon is look at the picture
Up lazy thing said the Queen and take this young lady to
see the Mock Turtle and to hear his history  I must go back and
see after some executions I have ordered and she walked off
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon  Alice did not quite like
the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would
be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
Queen  so she waited

  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the
Queen till she was out of sight  then it chuckled  What fun
said the Gryphon half to itself half to Alice

  What IS the fun? said Alice

  Why SHE said the Gryphon  Its all her fancy that  they
never executes nobody you know  Come on

  Everybody says "come on" here thought Alice as she went
slowly after it  I never was so ordered about in all my life
never

  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the
distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and
as they came nearer Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart
would break  She pitied him deeply  What is his sorrow? she
asked the Gryphon and the Gryphon answered very nearly in the
same words as before Its all his fancy that  he hasnt got
no sorrow you know  Come on

  So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with
large eyes full of tears but said nothing

  This here young lady said the Gryphon she wants for to
know your history she do

  Ill tell it her said the Mock Turtle in a deep hollow
tone  sit down both of you and dont speak a word till Ive
finished

  So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes  Alice
thought to herself I dont see how he can EVEN finish if he
doesnt begin  But she waited patiently

  Once said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh I was
a real Turtle

  These words were followed by a very long silence broken only
by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh from the Gryphon and
the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle  Alice was very
nearly getting up and saying Thank you sir for your
interesting story but she could not help thinking there MUST be
more to come so she sat still and said nothing

  When we were little the Mock Turtle went on at last more
calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to
school in the sea  The master was an old Turtlewe used to call
him Tortoise

  Why did you call him Tortoise if he wasnt one? Alice asked

  We called him Tortoise because he taught us said the Mock
Turtle angrily  really you are very dull

  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and
looked at poor Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth  At
last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle Drive on old fellow
Dont be all day about it and he went on in these words

  Yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe
it

  I never said I didnt interrupted Alice

  You did said the Mock Turtle

  Hold your tongue added the Gryphon before Alice could speak
again  The Mock Turtle went on

  We had the best of educationsin fact we went to school
every day

  IVE been to a dayschool too said Alice you neednt be
so proud as all that

  With extras? asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously

  Yes said Alice we learned French and music

  And washing? said the Mock Turtle

  Certainly not said Alice indignantly

  Ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the Mock
Turtle in a tone of great relief  Now at OURS they had at the
end of the bill "French music AND WASHINGextra"

  You couldnt have wanted it much said Alice living at the
bottom of the sea

  I couldnt afford to learn it said the Mock Turtle with a
sigh  I only took the regular course

  What was that? inquired Alice

  Reeling and Writhing of course to begin with the Mock
Turtle replied and then the different branches of Arithmetic
Ambition Distraction Uglification and Derision

  I never heard of "Uglification" Alice ventured to say  What
is it?

  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise  What  Never
heard of uglifying it exclaimed  You know what to beautify
is I suppose?

  Yes said Alice doubtfully  it meanstomakeanything
prettier

  Well then the Gryphon went on if you dont know what to
uglify is you ARE a simpleton

  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about
it so she turned to the Mock Turtle and said What else had you
to learn?

  Well there was Mystery the Mock Turtle replied counting
off the subjects on his flappers Mystery ancient and modern
with Seaography  then Drawlingthe Drawlingmaster was an old
congereel that used to come once a week  HE taught us
Drawling Stretching and Fainting in Coils

  What was THAT like? said Alice

  Well I cant show it you myself the Mock Turtle said  Im
too stiff  And the Gryphon never learnt it

  Hadnt time said the Gryphon  I went to the Classics
master though  He was an old crab HE was

  I never went to him the Mock Turtle said with a sigh  he
taught Laughing and Grief they used to say

  So he did so he did said the Gryphon sighing in his turn
and both creatures hid their faces in their paws

  And how many hours a day did you do lessons? said Alice in a
hurry to change the subject

  Ten hours the first day said the Mock Turtle nine the
next and so on

  What a curious plan exclaimed Alice

  Thats the reason theyre called lessons the Gryphon
remarked  because they lessen from day to day

  This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a
little before she made her next remark  Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday?

  Of course it was said the Mock Turtle

  And how did you manage on the twelfth? Alice went on eagerly

  Thats enough about lessons the Gryphon interrupted in a
very decided tone  tell her something about the games now



                            CHAPTER X

                      The Lobster Quadrille


  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper
across his eyes  He looked at Alice and tried to speak but for
a minute or two sobs choked his voice  Same as if he had a bone
in his throat said the Gryphon  and it set to work shaking him
and punching him in the back  At last the Mock Turtle recovered
his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on
again

  You may not have lived much under the sea I havent
said Aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster
Alice began to say I once tasted but checked herself hastily
and said No never so you can have no idea what a delightful
thing a Lobster Quadrille is

  No indeed said Alice  What sort of a dance is it?

  Why said the Gryphon you first form into a line along the
seashore

  Two lines cried the Mock Turtle  Seals turtles salmon
and so on then when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of
the way

  THAT generally takes some time interrupted the Gryphon

  you advance twice

  Each with a lobster as a partner cried the Gryphon

  Of course the Mock Turtle said  advance twice set to
partners

  change lobsters and retire in same order continued the
Gryphon

  Then you know the Mock Turtle went on you throw the

  The lobsters shouted the Gryphon with a bound into the air

  as far out to sea as you can

  Swim after them screamed the Gryphon

  Turn a somersault in the sea cried the Mock Turtle
capering wildly about

  Back to land again and thats all the first figure said the
Mock Turtle suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures
who had been jumping about like mad things all this time sat
down again very sadly and quietly and looked at Alice

  It must be a very pretty dance said Alice timidly

  Would you like to see a little of it? said the Mock Turtle

  Very much indeed said Alice

  Come lets try the first figure said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon  We can do without lobsters you know  Which shall
sing?

  Oh YOU sing said the Gryphon  Ive forgotten the words

  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice every now
and then treading on her toes when they passed too close and
waving their forepaws to mark the time while the Mock Turtle
sang this very slowly and sadly


"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail
"Theres a porpoise close behind us and hes treading on my
 tail
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance
They are waiting on the shinglewill you come and join the
dance?

Will you wont you will you wont you will you join the
dance?
Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the
dance?


"You can really have no notion how delightful it will be
When they take us up and throw us with the lobsters out to
                                                      sea"
But the snail replied "Too far too far" and gave a look
                                                       askance
Said he thanked the whiting kindly but he would not join the
   dance
    Would not could not would not could not would not join
        the dance
    Would not could not would not could not could not join
        the dance

"What matters it how far we go?" his scaly friend replied
"There is another shore you know upon the other side
The further off from England the nearer is to France
Then turn not pale beloved snail but come and join the dance

    Will you wont you will you wont you will you join the
         dance?
    Will you wont you will you wont you wont you join the
         dance?"



  Thank you its a very interesting dance to watch said
Alice feeling very glad that it was over at last  and I do so
like that curious song about the whiting

  Oh as to the whiting said the Mock Turtle theyyouve
seen them of course?

  Yes said Alice Ive often seen them at dinn she
checked herself hastily

  I dont know where Dinn may be said the Mock Turtle but
if youve seen them so often of course you know what theyre
like

  I believe so Alice replied thoughtfully  They have their
tails in their mouthsand theyre all over crumbs

  Youre wrong about the crumbs said the Mock Turtle
crumbs would all wash off in the sea  But they HAVE their tails
in their mouths and the reason is here the Mock Turtle
yawned and shut his eyesTell her about the reason and all
that he said to the Gryphon

  The reason is said the Gryphon that they WOULD go with
the lobsters to the dance  So they got thrown out to sea  So
they had to fall a long way  So they got their tails fast in
their mouths  So they couldnt get them out again  Thats all

  Thank you said Alice its very interesting  I never knew
so much about a whiting before

  I can tell you more than that if you like said the
Gryphon  Do you know why its called a whiting?

  I never thought about it said Alice  Why?

  IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES the Gryphon replied very
solemnly

  Alice was thoroughly puzzled  Does the boots and shoes she
repeated in a wondering tone

  Why what are YOUR shoes done with? said the Gryphon  I
mean what makes them so shiny?

  Alice looked down at them and considered a little before she
gave her answer  Theyre done with blacking I believe

  Boots and shoes under the sea the Gryphon went on in a deep
voice are done with a whiting  Now you know

  And what are they made of? Alice asked in a tone of great
curiosity

  Soles and eels of course the Gryphon replied rather
impatiently  any shrimp could have told you that

  If Id been the whiting said Alice whose thoughts were
still running on the song Id have said to the porpoise "Keep
back please  we dont want YOU with us"

  They were obliged to have him with them the Mock Turtle
said  no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise

  Wouldnt it really? said Alice in a tone of great surprise

  Of course not said the Mock Turtle  why if a fish came
to ME and told me he was going a journey I should say "With
what porpoise?"

  Dont you mean "purpose"? said Alice

  I mean what I say the Mock Turtle replied in an offended
tone  And the Gryphon added Come lets hear some of YOUR
adventures

  I could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning
said Alice a little timidly  but its no use going back to
yesterday because I was a different person then

  Explain all that said the Mock Turtle

  No no  The adventures first said the Gryphon in an
impatient tone  explanations take such a dreadful time

  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when
she first saw the White Rabbit  She was a little nervous about
it just at first the two creatures got so close to her one on
each side and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide but she
gained courage as she went on  Her listeners were perfectly
quiet till she got to the part about her repeating YOU ARE OLD
FATHER WILLIAM to the Caterpillar and the words all coming
different and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath and said
Thats very curious

  Its all about as curious as it can be said the Gryphon

  It all came different the Mock Turtle repeated
thoughtfully  I should like to hear her try and repeat
something now  Tell her to begin  He looked at the Gryphon as
if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice

  Stand up and repeat "TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD" said
the Gryphon

  How the creatures order one about and make one repeat
lessons thought Alice I might as well be at school at once
However she got up and began to repeat it but her head was so
full of the Lobster Quadrille that she hardly knew what she was
saying and the words came very queer indeed

    Tis the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare
    "You have baked me too brown I must sugar my hair"
    As a duck with its eyelids so he with his nose
    Trims his belt and his buttons and turns out his toes

              later editions continued as follows
    When the sands are all dry he is gay as a lark
    And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark
    But when the tide rises and sharks are around
    His voice has a timid and tremulous sound

  Thats different from what I used to say when I was a child
said the Gryphon

  Well I never heard it before said the Mock Turtle but it
sounds uncommon nonsense

  Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her
hands wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way
again

  I should like to have it explained said the Mock Turtle

  She cant explain it said the Gryphon hastily  Go on with
the next verse

  But about his toes? the Mock Turtle persisted  How COULD
he turn them out with his nose you know?

  Its the first position in dancing Alice said but was
dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing and longed to change the
subject

  Go on with the next verse the Gryphon repeated impatiently
it begins "I passed by his garden"

  Alice did not dare to disobey though she felt sure it would
all come wrong and she went on in a trembling voice

    I passed by his garden and marked with one eye
    How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie

        later editions continued as follows
    The Panther took piecrust and gravy and meat
    While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat
    When the pie was all finished the Owl as a boon
    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon
    While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl
    And concluded the banquet

  What IS the use of repeating all that stuff the Mock Turtle
interrupted if you dont explain it as you go on?  Its by far
the most confusing thing I ever heard

  Yes I think youd better leave off said the Gryphon  and
Alice was only too glad to do so

  Shall we try another figure of the Lobster Quadrille? the
Gryphon went on  Or would you like the Mock Turtle to sing you
a song?

  Oh a song please if the Mock Turtle would be so kind
Alice replied so eagerly that the Gryphon said in a rather
offended tone Hm No accounting for tastes  Sing her "Turtle
Soup" will you old fellow?

  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and began in a voice sometimes
choked with sobs to sing this


    Beautiful Soup so rich and green
    Waiting in a hot tureen
    Who for such dainties would not stoop?
    Soup of the evening beautiful Soup
    Soup of the evening beautiful Soup
        Beauootiful Soooop
        Beauootiful Soooop
    Soooop of the eeevening
        Beautiful beautiful Soup

    Beautiful Soup  Who cares for fish
    Game or any other dish?
    Who would not give all else for two p
    ennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
    Pennyworth only of beautiful Soup?
        Beauootiful Soooop
        Beauootiful Soooop
    Soooop of the eeevening
        Beautiful beautiFUL SOUP

  Chorus again cried the Gryphon and the Mock Turtle had
just begun to repeat it when a cry of The trials beginning
was heard in the distance

  Come on cried the Gryphon and taking Alice by the hand
it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song

  What trial is it? Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon
only answered Come on and ran the faster while more and more
faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the
melancholy words

    Soooop of the eeevening
        Beautiful beautiful Soup



                           CHAPTER XI

                      Who Stole the Tarts?


  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts
of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards
the Knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on
each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the
other  In the very middle of the court was a table with a large
dish of tarts upon it  they looked so good that it made Alice
quite hungry to look at themI wish theyd get the trial done
she thought and hand round the refreshments  But there seemed
to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about
her to pass away the time

  Alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had
read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that
she knew the name of nearly everything there  Thats the
judge she said to herself because of his great wig

  The judge by the way was the King and as he wore his crown
over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he
did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly
not becoming

  And thats the jurybox thought Alice and those twelve
creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because
some of them were animals and some were birds I suppose they
are the jurors  She said this last word two or three times over
to herself being rather proud of it  for she thought and
rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the
meaning of it at all  However jurymen would have done just
as well

  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
What are they doing?  Alice whispered to the Gryphon  They
cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun

  Theyre putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in
reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the
trial

  Stupid things Alice began in a loud indignant voice but
she stopped hastily for the White Rabbit cried out Silence in
the court and the King put on his spectacles and looked
anxiously round to make out who was talking

  Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their
shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things
on their slates and she could even make out that one of them
didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his
neighbour to tell him  A nice muddle their slatesll be in
before the trials over thought Alice

  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked  This of course
Alice could not stand and she went round the court and got
behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it
away  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was
Bill the Lizard could not make out at all what had become of
it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write
with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very
little use as it left no mark on the slate

  Herald read the accusation said the King

  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and
then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as followX
