Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
Unseen both when we wake and when we sleep
All these with ceaseless praise his works behold
Both day and night  How often from the steep
Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
Celestial voices to the midnight air
Sole or responsive each to others note
Singing their great Creator? oft in bands
While they keep watch or nightly rounding walk
With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds
In full harmonick number joined their songs
Divide the night and lift our thoughts to Heaven
Thus talking hand in hand alone they passed
On to their blissful bower it was a place
Chosen by the sovran Planter when he framed
All things to Mans delightful use the roof
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
Laurel and myrtle and what higher grew
Of firm and fragrant leaf on either side
Acanthus and each odorous bushy shrub
Fenced up the verdant wall each beauteous flower
Iris all hues roses and jessamin
Reared high their flourished heads between and wrought
Mosaick underfoot the violet
Crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay
Broidered the ground more coloured than with stone
Of costliest emblem  Other creature here
Bird beast insect or worm durst enter none
Such was their awe of Man  In shadier bower
More sacred and sequestered though but feigned
Pan or Sylvanus never slept nor Nymph
Nor Faunus haunted  Here in close recess
With flowers garlands and sweetsmelling herbs
Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed
And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung
What day the genial Angel to our sire
Brought her in naked beauty more adorned
More lovely than Pandora whom the Gods
Endowed with all their gifts and O too like
In sad event when to the unwiser son
Of Japhet brought by Hermes she ensnared
Mankind with her fair looks to be avenged
On him who had stole Joves authentick fire
Thus at their shady lodge arrived both stood
Both turned and under open sky adored
The God that made both sky air earth and heaven
Which they beheld the moons resplendent globe
And starry pole  Thou also madest the night
Maker Omnipotent and thou the day
Which we in our appointed work employed
Have finished happy in our mutual help
And mutual love the crown of all our bliss
Ordained by thee and this delicious place
For us too large where thy abundance wants
Partakers and uncropt falls to the ground
But thou hast promised from us two a race
To fill the earth who shall with us extol
Thy goodness infinite both when we wake
And when we seek as now thy gift of sleep
This said unanimous and other rites
Observing none but adoration pure
Which God likes best into their inmost bower
Handed they went and eased the putting off
These troublesome disguises which we wear
Straight side by side were laid nor turned I ween
Adam from his fair spouse nor Eve the rites
Mysterious of connubial love refused
Whatever hypocrites austerely talk
Of purity and place and innocence
Defaming as impure what God declares
Pure and commands to some leaves free to all
Our Maker bids encrease who bids abstain
But our Destroyer foe to God and Man?
Hail wedded Love mysterious law true source
Of human offspring sole propriety
In Paradise of all things common else
By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men
Among the bestial herds to range by thee
Founded in reason loyal just and pure
Relations dear and all the charities
Of father son and brother first were known
Far be it that I should write thee sin or blame
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place
Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets
Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced
Present or past as saints and patriarchs used
Here Love his golden shafts employs here lights
His constant lamp and waves his purple wings
Reigns here and revels not in the bought smile
Of harlots loveless joyless unendeared
Casual fruition nor in courtamours
Mixed dance or wanton mask or midnight ball
Or serenate which the starved lover sings
To his proud fair best quitted with disdain
These lulled by nightingales embracing slept
And on their naked limbs the flowery roof
Showered roses which the morn repaired  Sleep on
Blest pair and Oyet happiest if ye seek
No happier state and know to know no more
Now had night measured with her shadowy cone
Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault
And from their ivory port the Cherubim
Forth issuing at the accustomed hour stood armed
To their night watches in warlike parade
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake
Uzziel half these draw off and coast the south
With strictest watch these other wheel the north
Our circuit meets full west  As flame they part
Half wheeling to the shield half to the spear
From these two strong and subtle Spirits he called
That near him stood and gave them thus in charge
Ithuriel and Zephon with winged speed
Search through this garden leave unsearched no nook
But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harm
This evening from the suns decline arrived
Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen
Hitherward bent who could have thought? escaped
The bars of Hell on errand bad no doubt
Such where ye find seise fast and hither bring
So saying on he led his radiant files
Dazzling the moon these to the bower direct
In search of whom they sought  Him there they found
Squat like a toad close at the ear of Eve
Assaying by his devilish art to reach
The organs of her fancy and with them forge
Illusions as he list phantasms and dreams
Or if inspiring venom he might taint
The animal spirits that from pure blood arise
Like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
At least distempered discontented thoughts
Vain hopes vain aims inordinate desires
Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride
Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear
Touched lightly for no falshood can endure
Touch of celestial temper but returns
Of force to its own likeness  Up he starts
Discovered and surprised  As when a spark
Lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid
Fit for the tun some magazine to store
Against a rumoured war the smutty grain
With sudden blaze diffused inflames the air
So started up in his own shape the Fiend
Back stept those two fair Angels half amazed
So sudden to behold the grisly king
Yet thus unmoved with fear accost him soon
Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell
Comest thou escaped thy prison? and transformed
Why satst thou like an enemy in wait
Here watching at the head of these that sleep?
Know ye not then said Satan filled with scorn
Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate
For you there sitting where ye durst not soar
Not to know me argues yourselves unknown
The lowest of your throng or if ye know
Why ask ye and superfluous begin
Your message like to end as much in vain?
To whom thus Zephon answering scorn with scorn
Think not revolted Spirit thy shape the same
Or undiminished brightness to be known
As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure
That glory then when thou no more wast good
Departed from thee and thou resemblest now
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul
But come for thou be sure shalt give account
To him who sent us whose charge is to keep
This place inviolable and these from harm
So spake the Cherub and his grave rebuke
Severe in youthful beauty added grace
Invincible  Abashed the Devil stood
And felt how awful goodness is and saw
Virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined
His loss but chiefly to find here observed
His lustre visibly impaired yet seemed
Undaunted  If I must contend said he
Best with the best the sender not the sent
Or all at once more glory will be won
Or less be lost  Thy fear said Zephon bold
Will save us trial what the least can do
Single against thee wicked and thence weak
The Fiend replied not overcome with rage
But like a proud steed reined went haughty on
Champing his iron curb  To strive or fly
He held it vain awe from above had quelled
His heart not else dismayed  Now drew they nigh
The western point where those halfrounding guards
Just met and closing stood in squadron joined
A waiting next command  To whom their Chief
Gabriel from the front thus called aloud
O friends  I hear the tread of nimble feet
Hasting this way and now by glimpse discern
Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade
And with them comes a third of regal port
But faded splendour wan who by his gait
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell
Not likely to part hence without contest
Stand firm for in his look defiance lours
He scarce had ended when those two approached
And brief related whom they brought where found
How busied in what form and posture couched
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake
Why hast thou Satan broke the bounds prescribed
To thy transgressions and disturbed the charge
Of others who approve not to transgress
By thy example but have power and right
To question thy bold entrance on this place
Employed it seems to violate sleep and those
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss
To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow
Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise
And such I held thee but this question asked
Puts me in doubt  Lives there who loves his pain
Who would not finding way break loose from Hell
Though thither doomed  Thou wouldst thyself no doubt
And boldly venture to whatever place
Farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
Torment with ease and soonest recompense
Dole with delight which in this place I sought
To thee no reason who knowest only good
But evil hast not tried and wilt object
His will who bounds us  Let him surer bar
His iron gates if he intends our stay
In that dark durance  Thus much what was asked
The rest is true they found me where they say
But that implies not violence or harm
Thus he in scorn  The warlike Angel moved
Disdainfully half smiling thus replied
O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise
Since Satan fell whom folly overthrew
And now returns him from his prison scaped
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
Or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed
So wise he judges it to fly from pain
However and to scape his punishment
So judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath
