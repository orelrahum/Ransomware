    Western Germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically advanced
    goods The regions economy is mature services and manufacturing account
    for the dominant share of economic activity and raw materials and
    semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports In recent
    years manufacturing has accounted for about  of GDP with other sectors
    contributing lesser amounts Gross fixed investment in  accounted for
    about  of GDP In  GDP in the western region was an estimated
     per capita In contrast eastern Germanys economy is shedding the
    obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the Communist
    era Eastern Germanys share of allGerman GDP is only about  and eastern
    productivity is just  that of the west The privatization agency for
    eastern Germany the Treuhand is rapidly selling many of the  firms
    under its control The pace of private investment is starting to pick up
    but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain
    Eastern Germany has one of the worlds largest reserves of lowgrade lignite
    coal but little else in the way of mineral resources The quality of
    statistics from eastern Germany is improving yet many gaps remain the
    federal government began producing allGerman data for select economic
    statistics at the start of  The most challenging economic problem is
    promoting eastern Germanys economic reconstruction  specifically finding
    the right mix of fiscal monetary regulatory and tax policies that will
    spur investment in eastern Germany  without destabilizing western Germanys
    economy or damaging relations with West European partners The biggest
    danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could
    fuel inflation and prompt the German Central Bank the Bundesbank to keep a
    tight monetary policy to choke off a wageprice spiral Meanwhile the FRG
    has been providing billions of dollars to help the former Soviet republics
    and the reformist economies of Eastern Europe

    peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
    democratic government have been boosting government expenditures and
