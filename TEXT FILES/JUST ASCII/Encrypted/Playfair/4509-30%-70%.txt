Nigeria Economy

Overview
    Although Nigeria is Africas leading oilproducing country it remains poor
    with a  per capita GDP In  massive government spending much of it
    to help ensure a smooth transition to civilian rule ballooned the budget
    deficit and caused inflation and interest rates to rise The lack of fiscal
    discipline forced the IMF to declare Nigeria not in compliance with an
    month standby facility started in January  Lagos has set ambitious
    targets for expanding oil production capacity and is offering foreign
    companies more attractive investment incentives Government efforts to
    reduce Nigerias dependence on oil exports and to sustain noninflationary
    growth however have fallen short because of inadequate new investment
    funds and endemic corruption Living standards continue to deteriorate from
    the higher level of the early s oil boom
