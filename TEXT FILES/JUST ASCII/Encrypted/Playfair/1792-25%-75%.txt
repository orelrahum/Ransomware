          desirable

           Standards are a complex issue involving the medium the
          hardware the software and the technical capacity for
          reproductive fidelity and clarity

           The prognosis for reliable archival standards as defined by
          librarians in the foreseeable future is poor

     Significant potential and attractiveness of digital technology as a
     preservation medium and access mechanism

     Productive use of digital imagery for preservation requires a
     reconceptualizing of preservation principles in a volatile
     standardless world

     Concept of managing continuing access in the digital environment
     rather than focusing on the permanence of the medium and longterm
     archival standards developed for the analog world

     Transition period  How long and what to do?

            Redefine "archival"

            Remove the burden of "archival copy" from paper artifacts

            Use digital technology for storage develop management
          strategies for refreshing medium hardware and software

            Create acidfree paper copies for transition period backup
          until we develop reliable procedures for ensuring continuing
          access to digital files

SESSION IVD

Stuart WEIBEL            The Role of SGML Markup in the CORE Project 

The emergence of highspeed telecommunications networks as a basic
feature of the scholarly workplace is driving the demand for electronic
document delivery  Three distinct categories of electronic
publishingrepublishing are necessary to support access demands in this
emerging environment

       Conversion of paper or microfilm archives to electronic format
       Conversion of electronic files to formats tailored to
          electronic retrieval and display
       Primary electronic publishing materials for which the
          electronic version is the primary format

OCLC has experimental or product development activities in each of these
areas  Among the challenges that lie ahead is the integration of these
three types of information stores in coherent distributed systems

The CORE Chemistry Online Retrieval Experiment Project is a model for
the conversion of large text and graphics collections for which
electronic typesetting files are available category   The American
Chemical Society has made available computer typography files dating from
 for its twenty journals  This collection of some  journalyears
is being converted to an electronic format that will be accessible
through several enduser applications

The use of Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML offers the means
to capture the structural richness of the original articles in a way that
will support a variety of retrieval navigation and display options
necessary to navigate effectively in very large text databases

An SGML document consists of text that is marked up with descriptive tags
that specify the function of a given element within the document  As a
formal language construct an SGML document can be parsed against a
documenttype definition DTD that unambiguously defines what elements
are allowed and where in the document they can or must occur  This
formalized map of article structure allows the user interface design to
be uncoupled from the underlying database system an important step
toward interoperability  Demonstration of this separability is a part of
the CORE project wherein user interface designs born of very different
philosophies will access the same database

NOTES
       The CORE project is a collaboration among Cornell Universitys
     Mann Library Bell Communications Research Bellcore the American
     Chemical Society ACS the Chemical Abstracts Service CAS and
     OCLC

Michael LESK                  The CORE Electronic Chemistry Library

A major online file of chemical journal literature complete with
graphics is being developed to test the usability of fully electronic
access to documents as a joint project of Cornell University the
American Chemical Society the Chemical Abstracts Service OCLC and
Bellcore with additional support from Sun Microsystems SpringerVerlag
DigitaI Equipment Corporation Sony Corporation of America and Apple
Computers  Our file contains the American Chemical Societys online
journals supplemented with the graphics from the paper publication  The
indexing of the articles from Chemical Abstracts Documents is available
in both image and text format and several different interfaces can be
used  Our goals are  to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of
electronic access to primary journals as compared with paper and  to
identify the most desirable functions of the user interface to an
electronic system of journals including in particular a comparison of
pageimage display with ASCII display interfaces  Early experiments with
chemistry students on a variety of tasks suggest that searching tasks are
completed much faster with any electronic system than with paper but
that for reading all versions of the articles are roughly equivalent

Pamela ANDRE and Judith ZIDAR

Text conversion is far more expensive and timeconsuming than image
capture alone  NALs experience with optical character recognition OCR
will be related and compared with the experience of having text rekeyed
What factors affect OCR accuracy?  How accurate does full text have to be
in order to be useful?  How do different users react to imperfect text?
These are questions that will be explored  For many a service bureau
may be a better solution than performing the work inhouse this will also
be discussed

SESSION VI

Marybeth PETERS

Copyright law protects creative works  Protection granted by the law to
authors and disseminators of works includes the right to do or authorize
the following  reproduce the work prepare derivative works distribute
the work to the public and publicly perform or display the work  In
addition copyright owners of sound recordings and computer programs have
the right to control rental of their works  These rights are not
unlimited there are a number of exceptions and limitations

An electronic environment places strains on the copyright system
Copyright owners want to control uses of their work and be paid for any
use the public wants quick and easy access at little or no cost  The
marketplace is working in this area  Contracts guidelines on electronic
use and collective licensing are in use and being refined

Issues concerning the ability to change works without detection are more
difficult to deal with  Questions concerning the integrity of the work
and the status of the changed version under the copyright law are to be
addressed  These are public policy issues which require informed
dialogue

End of The Project Gutenberg Etext of LOC WORKSHOP ON ELECTRONIC ETEXTS


This is the February  Project Gutenberg release of

Paradise Lost by John Milton

The oldest etext known to Project Gutenberg ca 
If you know of any older ones please let us know


Introduction  one page

This etext was originally created in  according to Dr
Joseph Raben of Queens College NY to whom it is attributed by
Project Gutenberg  We had heard of this etext for years but it
was not until  that we actually managed to track it down to
a specific location and then it took months to convince people
to let us have a copy then more months for them actually to do
the copying and get it to us  Then another month to convert to
something we could massage with our favorite  in DOS  After
that is was only a matter of days to get it into this shape you
will see below  The original was of course in CAPS only and
so were all the other etexts of the s and early s  Dont
let anyone fool you into thinking any etext with both upper and
lower case is an original all those original Project Gutenberg
etexts were also in upper case and were translated or rewritten
many times to get them into their current condition  They have
been worked on by many people throughout the world

In the course of our searches for Professor Raben and his etext
we were never able to determine where copies were or which of a
variety of editions he may have used as a source  We did get a
little information here and there but even after we received a
copy of the etext we were unwilling to release it without first
determining that it was in fact Public Domain and finding Raben
to verify this and get his permission  Interested enough in a
totally unrelated action to our searches for him the professor
subscribed to the Project Gutenberg listserver and we happened
by accident to notice his name We dont really look at every
subscription request as the computers usually handle them The
etext was then properly identified copyright analyzed and the
current edition prepared

To give you an estimation of the difference in the original and
what we have today  the original was probably entered on cards
commonly known at the time as "IBM cards" Do Not Fold Spindle
or Mutilate and probably took in excess of  of them  A
single card could hold  characters hence  characters is an
accepted standard for so many computer margins and the entire
original edition we received in all caps was over  chars
in length including line enumeration symbols for caps and the
punctuation marks etc since they were not available keyboard
characters at the time probably the keyboards operated at baud
rates of around  meaning the typists had to type slowly for
the keyboard to keep up

This is the second version of Paradise Lost released by Project
Gutenberg  The first was released as our October  etext





Paradise Lost




Book I


Of Mans first disobedience and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
Brought death into the World and all our woe
With loss of Eden till one greater Man
Restore us and regain the blissful seat
Sing Heavenly Muse that on the secret top
Of Oreb or of Sinai didst inspire
That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
In the beginning how the heavens and earth
Rose out of Chaos or if Sion hill
Delight thee more and Siloas brook that flowed
Fast by the oracle of God I thence
Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song
That with no middle flight intends to soar
Above th Aonian mount while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme
And chiefly thou O Spirit that dost prefer
Before all temples th upright heart and pure
Instruct me for thou knowst thou from the first
Wast present and with mighty wings outspread
Dovelike satst brooding on the vast Abyss
And madst it pregnant what in me is dark
Illumine what is low raise and support
That to the height of this great argument
I may assert Eternal Providence
And justify the ways of God to men
  Say firstfor Heaven hides nothing from thy view
Nor the deep tract of Hellsay first what cause
Moved our grand parents in that happy state
Favoured of Heaven so highly to fall off
From their Creator and transgress his will
For one restraint lords of the World besides
Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?
  Th infernal Serpent he it was whose guile
Stirred up with envy and revenge deceived
The mother of mankind what time his pride
Had cast him out from Heaven with all his host
Of rebel Angels by whose aid aspiring
To set himself in glory above his peers
He trusted to have equalled the Most High
If he opposed and with ambitious aim
Against the throne and monarchy of God
Raised impious war in Heaven and battle proud
With vain attempt Him the Almighty Power
Hurled headlong flaming from th ethereal sky
With hideous ruin and combustion down
To bottomless perdition there to dwell
In adamantine chains and penal fire
Who durst defy th Omnipotent to arms
  Nine times the space that measures day and night
To mortal men he with his horrid crew
Lay vanquished rolling in the fiery gulf
Confounded though immortal But his doom
Reserved him to more wrath for now the thought
Both of lost happiness and lasting pain
Torments him round he throws his baleful eyes
That witnessed huge affliction and dismay
Mixed with obdurate pride and steadfast hate
At once as far as Angels ken he views
The dismal situation waste and wild
A dungeon horrible on all sides round
As one great furnace flamed yet from those flames
No light but rather darkness visible
Served only to discover sights of woe
Regions of sorrow doleful shades where peace
And rest can never dwell hope never comes
That comes to all but torture without end
Still urges and a fiery deluge fed
With everburning sulphur unconsumed
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared
For those rebellious here their prison ordained
In utter darkness and their portion set
As far removed from God and light of Heaven
As from the centre thrice to th utmost pole
Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell
There the companions of his fall oerwhelmed
With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire
He soon discerns and weltering by his side
One next himself in power and next in crime
Long after known in Palestine and named
Beelzebub To whom th ArchEnemy
And thence in Heaven called Satan with bold words
Breaking the horrid silence thus began
  "If thou beest hebut O how fallen how changed
From him who in the happy realms of light
Clothed with transcendent brightness didst outshine
Myriads though brightif he whom mutual league
United thoughts and counsels equal hope
And hazard in the glorious enterprise
Joined with me once now misery hath joined
In equal ruin into what pit thou seest
From what height fallen so much the stronger proved
He with his thunder and till then who knew
The force of those dire arms? Yet not for those
Nor what the potent Victor in his rage
Can else inflict do I repent or change
Though changed in outward lustre that fixed mind
And high disdain from sense of injured merit
That with the Mightiest raised me to contend
And to the fierce contentions brought along
Innumerable force of Spirits armed
That durst dislike his reign and me pESPAWSUDZ
