France Economy

Overview
    One of the worlds most developed economies France has substantial
    agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector
    Large tracts of fertile land the application of modern technology and
    subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in
    Western Europe France is largely selfsufficient in agricultural products
    and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products The industrial sector
    generates about onequarter of GDP and the growing services sector has
    become crucial to the economy After expanding at a rapid  pace during
    the period  the economy slowed down in  with growth of  in
     and  in  growth in  is expected to be about  The
    economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the
    labor force resulting in a high unemployment rate which rose to almost 
    in  The steadily advancing economic integration within the European
    Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic
    sectors

Gabon Economy

Overview
    The economy dependent on timber and manganese until the early s is now
    dominated by the oil sector During the period  oil accounted for
    about  of GDP  of export earnings and  of government revenues on
    average The high oil prices of the early s contributed to a substantial
    increase in per capita income stimulated domestic demand reinforced
    migration from rural to urban areas and raised the level of real wages to
    among the highest in SubSaharan Africa The threeyear slide of Gabons
    economy which began with falling oil prices in  was reversed in 
    because of a near doubling of oil prices over their  lows In  the
    economy posted strong growth despite serious strikes but debt servicing
    problems are hindering economic advancement The agricultural and industrial
    sectors are relatively underdeveloped except for oil
