United States Economy

Overview
    The US has the most powerful diverse and technologically advanced economy
    in the world with a per capita GDP of  the largest among major
    industrial nations The economy is market oriented with most decisions made
    by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of
    goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace In  the
    economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth the
    longest in peacetime history The expansion featured moderation in wage and
    consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to  of
    the labor force In  however growth slowed to  because of a
    combination of factors such as the worldwide increase in interest rates
    Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in August the subsequent spurt in oil prices and
    a general decline in business and consumer confidence In  output failed
    to recover unemployment grew and signs of recovery proved premature
    Ongoing problems for the s include inadequate investment in economic
    infrastructure rapidly rising medical costs and sizable budget and trade
    deficits
