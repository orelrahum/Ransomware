France Economy

Overview
    One of the worlds most developed economies France has substantial
    agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector
    Large tracts of fertile land the application of modern technology and
    subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in
    Western Europe France is largely selfsufficient in agricultural products
    and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products The industrial sector
    generates about onequarter of GDP and the growing services sector has
    become crucial to the economy After expanding at a rapid  pace during
    the period  the economy slowed down in  with growth of  in
     and  in  growth in  is expected to be about  The
    economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the
    labor force resulting in a high unemployment rate which rose to almost 
    in  The steadily advancing economic integration within the European
    Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic
    sectors

Overview
    The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and imports
    Besides the French space center at Kourou fishing and forestry are the most
    important economic activities with exports of fish and fish products

    large reserves of tropical hardwoods not fully exploited support an
    expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export Cultivation
    of crops  rice cassava bananas and sugarcane  are limited to the
    coastal area where the population is largely concentrated French Guiana is
    heavily dependent on imports of food and energy Unemployment is a serious
    problem particularly among younger workers
