just begun to repeat it when a cry of The trials beginning
was heard in the distance

  Come on cried the Gryphon and taking Alice by the hand
it hurried off without waiting for the end of the song

  What trial is it? Alice panted as she ran but the Gryphon
only answered Come on and ran the faster while more and more
faintly came carried on the breeze that followed them the
melancholy words

                           CHAPTER XI

                      Who Stole the Tarts?


  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
they arrived with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts
of little birds and beasts as well as the whole pack of cards
the Knave was standing before them in chains with a soldier on
each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit
with a trumpet in one hand and a scroll of parchment in the
other  In the very middle of the court was a table with a large
dish of tarts upon it  they looked so good that it made Alice
quite hungry to look at themI wish theyd get the trial done
she thought and hand round the refreshments  But there seemed
to be no chance of this so she began looking at everything about
her to pass away the time

  Alice had never been in a court of justice before but she had
read about them in books and she was quite pleased to find that
she knew the name of nearly everything there  Thats the
judge she said to herself because of his great wig

  The judge by the way was the King and as he wore his crown
over the wig look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he
did it he did not look at all comfortable and it was certainly
not becoming

  And thats the jurybox thought Alice and those twelve
creatures she was obliged to say creatures you see because
some of them were animals and some were birds I suppose they
are the jurors  She said this last word two or three times over
to herself being rather proud of it  for she thought and
rightly too that very few little girls of her age knew the
meaning of it at all  However jurymen would have done just
as well

  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates
What are they doing?  Alice whispered to the Gryphon  They
cant have anything to put down yet before the trials begun

  Theyre putting down their names the Gryphon whispered in
reply for fear they should forget them before the end of the
trial

  Stupid things Alice began in a loud indignant voice but
she stopped hastily for the White Rabbit cried out Silence in
the court and the King put on his spectacles and looked
anxiously round to make out who was talking

  Alice could see as well as if she were looking over their
shoulders that all the jurors were writing down stupid things
on their slates and she could even make out that one of them
didnt know how to spell stupid and that he had to ask his
neighbour to tell him  A nice muddle their slatesll be in
before the trials over thought Alice

  One of the jurors had a pencil that squeaked  This of course
Alice could not stand and she went round the court and got
behind him and very soon found an opportunity of taking it
away  She did it so quickly that the poor little juror it was
Bill the Lizard could not make out at all what had become of
it so after hunting all about for it he was obliged to write
with one finger for the rest of the day and this was of very
little use as it left no mark on the slate

  Herald read the accusation said the King

  On this the White Rabbit blew three blasts on the trumpet and
then unrolled the parchment scroll and read as follows

    The Queen of Hearts she made some tarts
          All on a summer day
      The Knave of Hearts he stole those tarts
          And took them quite away

  Consider your verdict the King said to the jury

  Not yet not yet the Rabbit hastily interrupted  Theres
a great deal to come before that

  Call the first witness said the King and the White Rabbit
blew three blasts on the trumpet and called out First
witness

  The first witness was the Hatter  He came in with a teacup in
one hand and a piece of breadandbutter in the other  I beg
pardon your Majesty he began for bringing these in  but I
hadnt quite finished my tea when I was sent for

  You ought to have finished said the King  When did you
begin?

  The Hatter looked at the March Hare who had followed him into
the court arminarm with the Dormouse  Fourteenth of March I
think it was he said

  Fifteenth said the March Hare

  Sixteenth added the Dormouse
