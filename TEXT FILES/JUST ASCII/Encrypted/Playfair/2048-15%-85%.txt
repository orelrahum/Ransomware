rubbing its eyes for it was getting very sleepy and they drew
all manner of thingseverything that begins with an M

  Why with an M? said Alice

  Why not? said the March Hare

  Alice was silent

  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time and was going
off into a doze but on being pinched by the Hatter it woke up
again with a little shriek and went on  that begins with an
M such as mousetraps and the moon and memory and muchness
you know you say things are "much of a muchness"did you ever
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?

  Really now you ask me said Alice very much confused I
dont think

  Then you shouldnt talk said the Hatter

  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear  she got
up in great disgust and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep
instantly and neither of the others took the least notice of her
going though she looked back once or twice half hoping that
they would call after her  the last time she saw them they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot

  At any rate Ill never go THERE again said Alice as she
picked her way through the wood  Its the stupidest teaparty I
ever was at in all my life

  Just as she said this she noticed that one of the trees had a
door leading right into it  Thats very curious she thought
But everythings curious today  I think I may as well go in at
once  And in she went

  Once more she found herself in the long hall and close to the
little glass table  Now Ill manage better this time she
said to herself and began by taking the little golden key and
unlocking the door that led into the garden  Then she went to
work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her
pocked till she was about a foot high  then she walked down the
little passage  and THENshe found herself at last in the
beautiful garden among the bright flowerbeds and the cool
fountains



                          CHAPTER VIII

                   The Queens CroquetGround


  A large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden  the
roses growing on it were white but there were three gardeners at
it busily painting them red  Alice thought this a very curious
thing and she went nearer to watch them and just as she came up
to them she heard one of them say Look out now Five  Dont go
splashing paint over me like that

  I couldnt help it said Five in a sulky tone Seven jogged
my elbow

  On which Seven looked up and said Thats right Five  Always
lay the blame on others

  YOUD better not talk said Five  I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded

  What for? said the one who had spoken first

  Thats none of YOUR business Two said Seven

  Yes it IS his business said Five and Ill tell himit
was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions

  Seven flung down his brush and had just begun Well of all
the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice as
she stood watching them and he checked himself suddenly  the
others looked round also and all of them bowed low

  Would you tell me said Alice a little timidly why you are
painting those roses?

  Five and Seven said nothing but looked at Two  Two began in a
low voice Why the fact is you see Miss this here ought to
have been a RED rosetree and we put a white one in by mistake
and if the Queen was to find it out we should all have our heads
cut off you know  So you see Miss were doing our best afore
she comes to  At this moment Five who had been anxiously
looking across the garden called out The Queen  The Queen
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
their faces  There was a sound of many footsteps and Alice
looked round eager to see the Queen

  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped
like the three gardeners oblong and flat with their hands and
feet at the corners  next the ten courtiers these were
ornamented all over with diamonds and walked two and two as the
soldiers did  After these came the royal children there were
ten of them and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
in hand in couples  they were all ornamented with hearts  Next
came the guests mostly Kings and Queens and among them Alice
recognised the White Rabbit  it was talking in a hurried nervous
manner smiling at everything that was said and went by without
noticing her  Then followed the Knave of Hearts carrying the
Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and last of all this
grand procession came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS

  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on
her face like the three gardeners but she could not remember
every having heard of such a rule at processions and besides
what would be the use of a procession thought she if people
had all to lie down upon their faces so that they couldnt see
it?  So she stood still where she was and waited

  When the procession came opposite to Alice they all stopped
and looked at her and the Queen said severely Who is this?
She said it to the Knave of Hearts who only bowed and smiled in
reply

  Idiot said the Queen tossing her head impatiently and
turning to Alice she went on Whats your name child?

  My name is Alice so please your Majesty said Alice very
politely but she added to herself Why theyre only a pack of
cards after all  I neednt be afraid of them

  And who are THESE? said the Queen pointing to the three
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for you see as
they were lying on their faces and the pattern on their backs
was the same as the rest of the pack she could not tell whether
they were gardeners or soldiers or courtiers or three of her
own children

  How should I know? said Alice surprised at her own courage
Its no business of MINE

  The Queen turned crimson with fury and after glaring at her
for a moment like a wild beast screamed Off with her head
Off

  Nonsense said Alice very loudly and decidedly and the
Queen was silent

  The King laid his hand upon her arm and timidly said
Consider my dear  she is only a child

  The Queen turned angrily away from him and said to the Knave
Turn them over

  The Knave did so very carefully with one foot

  Get up said the Queen in a shrill loud voice and the
three gardeners instantly jumped up and began bowing to the
King the Queen the royal children and everybody else

  Leave off that screamed the Queen  You make me giddy
And then turning to the rosetree she went on What HAVE you
been doing here?

  May it please your Majesty said Two in a very humble tone
going down on one knee as he spoke we were trying

  I see said the Queen who had meanwhile been examining the
roses  Off with their heads and the procession moved on
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
gardeners who ran to Alice for protection

  You shant be beheaded said Alice and she put them into a
large flowerpot that stood near  The three soldiers wandered
about for a minute or two looking for them and then quietly
marched off after the others

  Are their heads off? shouted the Queen

  Their heads are gone if it please your Majesty the soldiers
shouted in reply

  Thats right shouted the Queen  Can you play croquet?

  The soldiers were silent and looked at Alice as the question
was evidently meant for her

  Yes shouted Alice

  Come on then roared the Queen and Alice joined the
procession wondering very much what would happen next

  Itsits a very fine day said a timid voice at her side
She was walking by the White Rabbit who was peeping anxiously
into her face

  Very said Alice  wheres the Duchess?

  Hush  Hush said the Rabbit in a low hurried tone  He
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke and then raised
himself upon tiptoe put his mouth close to her ear and
whispered Shes under sentence of execution

  What for? said Alice

  Did you say "What a pity"? the Rabbit asked

  No I didnt said Alice  I dont think its at all a pity
I said "What for?"

  She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began  Alice gave a
little scream of laughter  Oh hush the Rabbit whispered in a
frightened tone  The Queen will hear you  You see she came
rather late and the Queen said

  Get to your places shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder
and people began running about in all directions tumbling up
against each other however they got settled down in a minute or
two and the game began  Alice thought she had never seen such a
curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and
furrows the balls were live hedgehogs the mallets live
flamingoes and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to
stand on their hands and feet to make the arches

  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her
flamingo  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away
comfortably enough under her arm with its legs hanging down
but generally just as she had got its neck nicely straightened
out and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head it
WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face with such a
puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing
and when she had got its head down and was going to begin again
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself and was in the act of crawling away  besides all this
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to and as the doubledup soldiers
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the
ground Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
difficult game indeed

  The players all played at once without waiting for turns
quarrelling all the while and fighting for the hedgehogs and in
a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion and went
stamping about and shouting Off with his head or Off with
her head about once in a minute

  Alice began to feel very uneasy  to be sure she had not as
yet had any dispute with the Queen but she knew that it might
happen any minute and then thought she what would become of
me?  Theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great
wonder is that theres any one left alive

  She was looking about for some way of escape and wondering
whether she could get away without being seen when she noticed a
curious appearance in the air  it puzzled her very much at
first but after watching it a minute or two she made it out to
be a grin and she said to herself Its the Cheshire Cat  now I
shall have somebody to talk to

  How are you getting on? said the Cat as soon as there was
mouth enough for it to speak with

  Alice waited till the eyes appeared and then nodded  Its no
use speaking to it she thought till its ears have come or at
least one of them  In another minute the whole head appeared
and then Alice put down her flamingo and began an account of the
game feeling very glad she had someone to listen to her  The
Cat seemed to think that there was enough of it now in sight and
no more of it appeared

  I dont think they play at all fairly Alice began in rather
a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant
hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in
particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand
youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive
for instance theres the arch Ive got to go through next
walking about at the other end of the groundand I should have
croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it
saw mine coming

  How do you like the Queen? said the Cat in a low voice

  Not at all said Alice  shes so extremely  Just then
she noticed that the Queen was close behind her listening  so
she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while
finishing the game

  The Queen smiled and passed on

  Who ARE you talking to? said the King going up to Alice and
looking at the Cats head with great curiosity

  Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat said Alice  allow me
to introduce it

  I dont like the look of it at all said the King  however
it may kiss my hand if it likes

  Id rather not the Cat remarked

  Dont be impertinent said the King and dont look at me
like that  He got behind Alice as he spoke

  A cat may look at a king said Alice  Ive read that in
some book but I dont remember where

  Well it must be removed said the King very decidedly and
he called the Queen who was passing at the moment My dear  I
wish you would have this cat removed

  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great
or small  Off with his head she said without even looking
round

  Ill fetch the executioner myself said the King eagerly and
he hurried off

  Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game
was going on as she heard the Queens voice in the distance
screaming with passion  She had already heard her sentence three
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and
she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in
such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or
not  So she went in search of her hedgehog

  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one
of them with the other  the only difficulty was that her
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
into a tree

  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back
the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight
but it doesnt matter much thought Alice as all the arches
are gone from this side of the ground  So she tucked it away
under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for
a little more conversation with her friend

  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to
find quite a large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute
going on between the executioner the King and the Queen who
were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent
and looked very uncomfortable

  The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to
settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her
though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed
to make out exactly what they said

  The executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a
head unless there was a body to cut it off from  that he had
never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin
at HIS time of life

  The Kings argument was that anything that had a head could be
beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense

  The Queens argument was that if something wasnt done about
it in less than no time shed have everybody executed all round
It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so
grave and anxious

  Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the
Duchess  youd better ask HER about it

  Shes in prison the Queen said to the executioner  fetch
her here  And the executioner went off like an arrow

   The Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone and
by the time he had come back with the Dutchess it had entirely
disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and
down looking for it while the rest of the party went back to the game



                           CHAPTER IX

                     The Mock Turtles Story


  You cant think how glad I am to see you again you dear old
thing said the Duchess as she tucked her arm affectionately
into Alices and they walked off together

  Alice was very glad to find her in such a pleasant temper and
thought to herself that perhaps it was only the pepper that had
made her so savage when they met in the kitchen

  When IM a Duchess she said to herself not in a very
hopeful tone though I wont have any pepper in my kitchen AT
ALL  Soup does very well withoutMaybe its always pepper that
makes people hottempered she went on very much pleased at
having found out a new kind of rule and vinegar that makes them
sourand camomile that makes them bitterandand barleysugar
and such things that make children sweettempered  I only wish
people knew that  then they wouldnt be so stingy about it you
know

  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time and was a
little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear
Youre thinking about something my dear and that makes you
forget to talk  I cant tell you just now what the moral of that
is but I shall remember it in a bit

  Perhaps it hasnt one Alice ventured to remark

  Tut tut child said the Duchess  Everythings got a
moral if only you can find it  And she squeezed herself up
closer to Alices side as she spoke

  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her  first
because the Duchess was VERY ugly and secondly because she was
exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alices shoulder
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin  However she did not
like to be rude so she bore it as well as she could

  The games going on rather better now she said by way of
keeping up the conversation a little

  Tis so said the Duchess  and the moral of that is"Oh
tis love tis love that makes the world go round"

  Somebody said Alice whispered that its done by everybody
minding their own business

  Ah well  It means much the same thing said the Duchess
digging her sharp little chin into Alices shoulder as she added
and the moral of THAT is"Take care of the sense and the
sounds will take care of themselves"

  How fond she is of finding morals in things Alice thought to
herself

  I dare say youre wondering why I dont put my arm round your
waist the Duchess said after a pause  the reason is that Im
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo  Shall I try the
experiment?

  HE might bite Alice cautiously replied not feeling at all
anxious to have the experiment tried

  Very true said the Duchess  flamingoes and mustard both
bite  And the moral of that is"Birds of a feather flock
together"

  Only mustard isnt a bird Alice remarked

  Right as usual said the Duchess  what a clear way you
have of putting things

  Its a mineral I THINK said Alice

  Of course it is said the Duchess who seemed ready to agree
to everything that Alice said theres a large mustardmine near
here  And the moral of that is"The more there is of mine the
less there is of yours"

  Oh I know exclaimed Alice who had not attended to this
last remark its a vegetable  It doesnt look like one but it
is

  I quite agree with you said the Duchess and the moral of
that is"Be what you would seem to be"or if youd like it put
more simply"Never imagine yourself not to be otherwise than
what it might appear to others that what you were or might have
been was not otherwise than what you had been would have appeared
to them to be otherwise"

  I think I should understand that better Alice said very
politely if I had it written down  but I cant quite follow it
as you say it

  Thats nothing to what I could say if I chose the Duchess
replied in a pleased tone

  Pray dont trouble yourself to say it any longer than that
said Alice

  Oh dont talk about trouble said the Duchess  I make you
a present of everything Ive said as yet

  A cheap sort of present thought Alice  Im glad they dont
give birthday presents like that  But she did not venture to
say it out loud

  Thinking again? the Duchess asked with another dig of her
sharp little chin

  Ive a right to think said Alice sharply for she was
beginning to feel a little worried

  Just about as much right said the Duchess as pigs have to
fly and the m

  But here to Alices great surprise the Duchesss voice died
away even in the middle of her favourite word moral and the
arm that was linked into hers began to tremble  Alice looked up
and there stood the Queen in front of them with her arms folded
frowning like a thunderstorm

  A fine day your Majesty the Duchess began in a low weak
voice

  Now I give you fair warning shouted the Queen stamping on
the ground as she spoke either you or your head must be off
and that in about half no time  Take your choice

  The Duchess took her choice and was gone in a moment

  Lets go on with the game the Queen said to Alice and Alice
was too much frightened to say a word but slowly followed her
back to the croquetground

  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queens absence
and were resting in the shade  however the moment they saw her
they hurried back to the game the Queen merely remarking that a
moments delay would cost them their lives

  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off
quarrelling with the other players and shouting Off with his
head or Off with her head  Those whom she sentenced were
taken into custody by the soldiers who of course had to leave
off being arches to do this so that by the end of half an hour
or so there were no arches left and all the players except the
King the Queen and Alice were in custody and under sentence of
execution

  Then the Queen left off quite out of breath and said to
Alice Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?

  No said Alice  I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is

  Its the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from said the Queen

  I never saw one or heard of one said Alice

  Come on then said the Queen and he shall tell you his
history

  As they walked off together Alice heard the King say in a low
voice to the company generally You are all pardoned  Come
THATS a good thing she said to herself for she had felt quite
unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered

  They very soon came upon a Gryphon lying fast asleep in the
sun  IF you dont know what a Gryphon is look at the picture
Up lazy thing said the Queen and take this young lady to
see the Mock Turtle and to hear his history  I must go back and
see after some executions I have ordered and she walked off
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon  Alice did not quite like
the look of the creature but on the whole she thought it would
be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
Queen  so she waited

  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes  then it watched the
Queen till she was out of sight  then it chuckled  What fun
said the Gryphon half to itself half to Alice

  What IS the fun? said Alice

  Why SHE said the Gryphon  Its all her fancy that  they
never executes nobody you know  Come on

  Everybody says "come on" here thought Alice as she went
slowly after it  I never was so ordered about in all my life
never

  They had not gone far before they saw the Mock Turtle in the
distance sitting sad and lonely on a little ledge of rock and
as they came nearer Alice could hear him sighing as if his heart
would break  She pitied him deeply  What is his sorrow? she
asked the Gryphon and the Gryphon answered very nearly in the
same words as before Its all his fancy that  he hasnt got
no sorrow you know  Come on

  So they went up to the Mock Turtle who looked at them with
large eyes full of tears but said nothing

  This here young lady said the Gryphon she wants for to
know your history she do

  Ill tell it her said the Mock Turtle in a deep hollow
tone  sit down both of you and dont speak a word till Ive
finished

  So they sat down and nobody spoke for some minutes  Alice
thought to herself I dont see how he can EVEN finish if he
doesnt begin  But she waited patiently

  Once said the Mock Turtle at last with a deep sigh I was
a real Turtle

  These words were followed by a very long silence broken only
by an occasional exclamation of Hjckrrh from the Gryphon and
the constant heavy sobbing of the Mock Turtle  Alice was very
nearly getting up and saying Thank you sir for your
interesting story but she could not help thinking there MUST be
more to come so she sat still and said nothing

  When we were little the Mock Turtle went on at last more
calmly though still sobbing a little now and then we went to
school in the sea  The master was an old Turtlewe used to call
him Tortoise

  Why did you call him Tortoise if he wasnt one? Alice asked

  We called him Tortoise because he taught us said the Mock
Turtle angrily  really you are very dull

  You ought to be ashamed of yourself for asking such a simple
question added the Gryphon and then they both sat silent and
looked at poor Alice who felt ready to sink into the earth  At
last the Gryphon said to the Mock Turtle Drive on old fellow
Dont be all day about it and he went on in these words

  Yes we went to school in the sea though you maynt believe
it

  I never said I didnt interrupted Alice

  You did said the Mock Turtle

  Hold your tongue added the Gryphon before Alice could speak
again  The Mock Turtle went on

  We had the best of educationsin fact we went to school
every day

  IVE been to a dayschool too said Alice you neednt be
so proud as all that

  With extras? asked the Mock Turtle a little anxiously

  Yes said Alice we learned French and music

  And washing? said the Mock Turtle

  Certainly not said Alice indignantly

  Ah then yours wasnt a really good school said the Mock
Turtle in a tone of great relief  Now at OURS they had at the
end of the bill "French music AND WASHINGextra"

  You couldnt have wanted it much said Alice living at the
bottom of the sea

  I couldnt afford to learn it said the Mock Turtle with a
sigh  I only took the regular course

  What was that? inquired Alice

  Reeling and Writhing of course to begin with the Mock
Turtle replied and then the different branches of Arithmetic
Ambition Distraction Uglification and Derision

  I never heard of "Uglification" Alice ventured to say  What
is it?

  The Gryphon lifted up both its paws in surprise  What  Never
heard of uglifying it exclaimed  You know what to beautify
is I suppose?

  Yes said Alice doubtfully  it meanstomakeanything
prettier

  Well then the Gryphon went on if you dont know what to
uglify is you ARE a simpleton

  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about
it so she turned to the Mock Turtle and said What else had you
to learn?

  Well there was Mystery the Mock Turtle replied counting
off the subjects on his flappers Mystery ancient and modern
with Seaography  then Drawlingthe Drawlingmaster was an old
congereel that used to come once a week  HE taught us
Drawling Stretching and Fainting in Coils

  What was THAT like? said Alice

  Well I cant show it you myself the Mock Turtle said  Im
too stiff  And the Gryphon never learnt it

  Hadnt time said the Gryphon  I went to the Classics
master though  He was an old crab HE was

  I never went to him the Mock Turtle said with a sigh  he
taught Laughing and Grief they used to say

  So he did so he did said the Gryphon sighing in his turn
and both creatures hid their faces in their paws

  And how many hours a day did you do lessons? said Alice in a
hurry to change the subject

  Ten hours the first day said the Mock Turtle nine the
next and so on

  What a curious plan exclaimed Alice

  Thats the reason theyre called lessons the Gryphon
remarked  because they lessen from day to day

  This was quite a new idea to Alice and she thought it over a
little before she made her next remark  Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday?

  Of course it was said the Mock Turtle

  And how did you manage on the twelfth? Alice went on eagerly

  Thats enough about lessons the Gryphon interrupted in a
very decided tone  tell her something about the games now



                            CHAPTER X

                      The Lobster Quadrille


  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply and drew the back of one flapper
across his eyes  He looked at Alice and tried to speak but for
a minute or two sobs choked his voice  Same as if he had a bone
in his throat said the Gryphon  and it set to work shaking him
and punching him in the back  At last the Mock Turtle recovered
his voice and with tears running down his cheeks he went on
again

  You may not have lived much under the sea I havent
said Aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster
Alice began to say I once tasted but checked herself hastily
and said No never so you can have no idea what a delightful
thing a Lobster Quadrille is

  No indeed said Alice  What sort of a dance is it?

  Why said the Gryphon you first form into a line along the
seashore

  Two lines cried the Mock Turtle  Seals turtles salmon
and so on then when youve cleared all the jellyGUPR IOZ MZ
