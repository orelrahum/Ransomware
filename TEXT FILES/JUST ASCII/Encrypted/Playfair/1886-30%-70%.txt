Syria Economy

Overview
    Syrias statedominated Bathist economy has benefited from the Gulf war
    increased oil production good weather and economic deregulation Economic
    growth averaged nearly  annually in  buoyed by increased oil
    production and improved agricultural performance The Gulf war of early 
    provided Syria an aid windfall of several billion dollars from Arab
    European and Japanese donors These inflows more than offset Damascuss
    warrelated costs and will help Syria cover some of its debt arrears
    restore suspended credit lines and initiate selected military and civilian
    purchases For the long run Syrias economy is still saddled with a large
    number of poorly performing public sector firms investment levels remain
    low and industrial and agricultural productivity is poor A major longterm
    concern is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when
    its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed by middecade

    electric power and aluminum production based on the countrys sizable
    hydropower resources and a surprising specialty in the production of
    metalcutting machine tools In  and early  disruptions in food
    supplies from the outside have severely strained the availability of food
    throughout the republic The combination of the poor food supply the
    general disruption of industrial links to suppliers and markets and
    political instability have meant that the republics leadership could make
