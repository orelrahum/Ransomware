  "So strange thy outcry and thy words so strange
Thou interposest that my sudden hand
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
What it intends till first I know of thee
What thing thou art thus doubleformed and why
In this infernal vale first met thou callst
Me father and that phantasm callst my son
I know thee not nor ever saw till now
Sight more detestable than him and thee"
  T whom thus the Portress of Hellgate replied
"Hast thou forgot me then and do I seem
Now in thine eye so foul?once deemed so fair
In Heaven when at th assembly and in sight
Of all the Seraphim with thee combined
In bold conspiracy against Heavens King
All on a sudden miserable pain
Surprised thee dim thine eyes and dizzy swum
In darkness while thy head flames thick and fast
Threw forth till on the left side opening wide
Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright
Then shining heavenly fair a goddess armed
Out of thy head I sprung Amazement seized
All th host of Heaven back they recoiled afraid
At first and called me Sin and for a sign
Portentous held me but familiar grown
I pleased and with attractive graces won
The most aversethee chiefly who full oft
Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing
Becamst enamoured and such joy thou tookst
With me in secret that my womb conceived
A growing burden Meanwhile war arose
And fields were fought in Heaven wherein remained
For what could else? to our Almighty Foe
Clear victory to our part loss and rout
Through all the Empyrean Down they fell
Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven down
Into this Deep and in the general fall
I also at which time this powerful key
Into my hands was given with charge to keep
These gates for ever shut which none can pass
Without my opening Pensive here I sat
Alone but long I sat not till my womb
Pregnant by thee and now excessive grown
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest
Thine own begotten breaking violent way
Tore through my entrails that with fear and pain
Distorted all my nether shape thus grew
Transformed but he my inbred enemy
Forth issued brandishing his fatal dart
Made to destroy I fled and cried out Death
Hell trembled at the hideous name and sighed
From all her caves and back resounded Death
I fled but he pursued though more it seems
Inflamed with lust than rage and swifter far
Me overtook his mother all dismayed
And in embraces forcible and foul
Engendering with me of that rape begot
These yelling monsters that with ceaseless cry
Surround me as thou sawsthourly conceived
And hourly born with sorrow infinite
To me for when they list into the womb
That bred them they return and howl and gnaw
My bowels their repast then bursting forth
Afresh with conscious terrors vex me round
That rest or intermission none I find
Before mine eyes in opposition sits
Grim Death my son and foe who set them on
And me his parent would full soon devour
For want of other prey but that he knows
His end with mine involved and knows that I
Should prove a bitter morsel and his bane
Whenever that shall be so Fate pronounced
But thou O father I forewarn thee shun
His deadly arrow neither vainly hope
To be invulnerable in those bright arms
Through tempered heavenly for that mortal dint
Save he who reigns above none can resist"
  She finished and the subtle Fiend his lore
Soon learned now milder and thus answered smooth
  "Dear daughtersince thou claimst me for thy sire
And my fair son here showst me the dear pledge
Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven and joys
Then sweet now sad to mention through dire change
Befallen us unforeseen unthoughtofknow
I come no enemy but to set free
From out this dark and dismal house of pain
Both him and thee and all the heavenly host
Of Spirits that in our just pretences armed
Fell with us from on high From them I go
This uncouth errand sole and one for all
Myself expose with lonely steps to tread
Th unfounded Deep and through the void immense
To search with wandering quest a place foretold
Should beand by concurring signs ere now
Created vast and rounda place of bliss
In the purlieus of Heaven and therein placed
A race of upstart creatures to supply
Perhaps our vacant room though more removed
Lest Heaven surcharged with potent multitude
Might hap to move new broils Be this or aught
Than this more secret now designed I haste
To know and this once known shall soon return
And bring ye to the place where thou and Death
Shall dwell at ease and up and down unseen
Wing silently the buxom air embalmed
With odours There ye shall be fed and filled
Immeasurably all things shall be your prey"
  He ceased for both seemed highly pleased and Death
Grinned horrible a ghastly smile to hear
His famine should be filled and blessed his maw
Destined to that good hour No less rejoiced
His mother bad and thus bespake her sire
  "The key of this infernal Pit by due
And by command of Heavens allpowerful King
I keep by him forbidden to unlock
These adamantine gates against all force
Death ready stands to interpose his dart
Fearless to be oermatched by living might
But what owe I to his commands above
Who hates me and hath hither thrust me down
Into this gloom of Tartarus profound
To sit in hateful office here confined
Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born
Here in perpetual agony and pain
With terrors and with clamours compassed round
Of mine own brood that on my bowels feed?
Thou art my father thou my author thou
My being gavst me whom should I obey
But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon
To that new world of light and bliss among
The gods who live at ease where I shall reign
At thy right hand voluptuous as beseems
Thy daughter and thy darling without end"
  Thus saying from her side the fatal key
Sad instrument of all our woe she took
And towards the gate rolling her bestial train
Forthwith the huge portcullis high updrew
Which but herself not all the Stygian Powers
Could once have moved then in the keyhole turns
Th intricate wards and every bolt and bar
Of massy iron or solid rock with ease
Unfastens On a sudden open fly
With impetuous recoil and jarring sound
Th infernal doors and on their hinges grate
Harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shook
Of Erebus She opened but to shut
Excelled her power the gates wide open stood
That with extended wings a bannered host
Under spread ensigns marching mibht pass through
With horse and chariots ranked in loose array
So wide they stood and like a furnacemouth
Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame
Before their eyes in sudden view appear
The secrets of the hoary Deepa dark
Illimitable ocean without bound
Without dimension where length breadth and height
And time and place are lost where eldest Night
And Chaos ancestors of Nature hold
Eternal anarchy amidst the noise
Of endless wars and by confusion stand
For Hot Cold Moist and Dry four champions fierce
Strive here for mastery and to battle bring
Their embryon atoms they around the flag
Of each his faction in their several clans
Lightarmed or heavy sharp smooth swift or slow
Swarm populous unnumbered as the sands
Of Barca or Cyrenes torrid soil
Levied to side with warring winds and poise
Their lighter wings To whom these most adhere
He rules a moment Chaos umpire sits
And by decision more embroils the fray
By which he reigns next him high arbiter
Chance governs all Into this wild Abyss
The womb of Nature and perhaps her grave
Of neither sea nor shore nor air nor fire
But all these in their pregnant causes mixed
Confusedly and which thus must ever fight
Unless th Almighty Maker them ordain
His dark materials to create more worlds
Into this wild Abyss the wary Fiend
Stood on the brink of Hell and looked a while
Pondering his voyage for no narrow frith
He had to cross Nor was his ear less pealed
With noises loud and ruinous to compare
Great things with small than when Bellona storms
With all her battering engines bent to rase
Some capital city or less than if this frame
Of Heaven were falling and these elements
In mutiny had from her axle torn
The steadfast Earth At last his sailbroad vans
He spread for flight and in the surging smoke
Uplifted spurns the ground thence many a league
As in a cloudy chair ascending rides
Audacious but that seat soon failing meets
A vast vacuity All unawares
Fluttering his pennons vain plumbdown he drops
Ten thousand fathom deep and to this hour
Down had been falling had not by ill chance
The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud
Instinct with fire and nitre hurried him
As many miles aloft That fury stayed
Quenched in a boggy Syrtis neither sea
Nor good dry landnigh foundered on he fares
Treading the crude consistence half on foot
Half flying behoves him now both oar and sail
As when a gryphon through the wilderness
With winged course oer hill or moory dale
Pursues the Arimaspian who by stealth
Had from his wakeful custody purloined
The guarded gold so eagerly the Fiend
Oer bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare
With head hands wings or feet pursues his way
And swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies
At length a universal hubbub wild
Of stunning sounds and voices all confused
Borne through the hollow dark assaults his ear
With loudest vehemence Thither he plies
Undaunted to meet there whatever Power
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
Might in that noise reside of whom to ask
Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
Bordering on light when straight behold the throne
Of Chaos and his dark pavilion spread
Wide on the wasteful Deep With him enthroned
Sat sablevested Night eldest of things
The consort of his reign and by them stood
Orcus and Ades and the dreaded name
Of Demogorgon Rumour next and Chance
And Tumult and Confusion all embroiled
And Discord with a thousand various mouths
  T whom Satan turning boldly thus"Ye Powers
And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss
Chaos and ancient Night I come no spy
With purpose to explore or to disturb
The secrets of your realm but by constraint
Wandering this darksome desert as my way
Lies through your spacious empire up to light
Alone and without guide half lost I seek
What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds
Confine with Heaven or if some other place
From your dominion won th Ethereal King
Possesses lately thither to arrive
I travel this profound Direct my course
Directed no mean recompense it brings
To your behoof if I that region lost
All usurpation thence expelled reduce
To her original darkness and your sway
Which is my present journey and once more
Erect the standard there of ancient Night
Yours be th advantage all mine the revenge"
  Thus Satan and him thus the Anarch old
With faltering speech and visage incomposed
Answered  "I know thee stranger who thou art  
That mighty leading Angel who of late
Made head against Heavens King though overthrown
I saw and heard for such a numerous host
Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep
With ruin upon ruin rout on rout
Confusion worse confounded and Heavengates
Poured out by millions her victorious bands
Pursuing I upon my frontiers here
Keep residence if all I can will serve
That little which is left so to defend
Encroached on still through our intestine broils
Weakening the sceptre of old Night first Hell
Your dungeon stretching far and wide beneath
Now lately Heaven and Earth another world
Hung oer my realm linked in a golden chain
To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell
If that way be your walk you have not far
So much the nearer danger Go and speed
Havoc and spoil and ruin are my gain"
  He ceased and Satan stayed not to reply
But glad that now his sea should find a shore
With fresh alacrity and force renewed
Springs upward like a pyramid of fire
Into the wild expanse and through the shock
Of fighting elements on all sides round
Environed wins his way harder beset
And more endangered than when Argo passed
Through Bosporus betwixt the justling rocks
Or when Ulysses on the larboard shunned
Charybdis and by th other whirlpool steered
So he with difficulty and labour hard
Moved on with difficulty and labour he
But he once passed soon after when Man fell
Strange alteration Sin and Death amain
Following his track such was the will of Heaven
Paved after him a broad and beaten way
Over the dark Abyss whose boiling gulf
Tamely endured a bridge of wondrous length
From Hell continued reaching th utmost orb
Of this frail World by which the Spirits perverse
With easy intercourse pass to and fro
To tempt or punish mortals except whom
God and good Angels guard by special grace
  But now at last the sacred influence
Of light appears and from the walls of Heaven
Shoots far into the bosom of dim Night
A glimmering dawn Here Nature first begins
Her farthest verge and Chaos to retire
As from her outmost works a broken foe
With tumult less and with less hostile din
That Satan with less toil and now with ease
Wafts on the calmer wave by dubious light
And like a weatherbeaten vessel holds
Gladly the port though shrouds and tackle torn
Or in the emptier waste resembling air
Weighs his spread wings at leisure to behold
Far off th empyreal Heaven extended wide
In circuit undetermined square or round
With opal towers and battlements adorned
Of living sapphire once his native seat
And fast by hanging in a golden chain
This pendent World in bigness as a star
Of smallest magnitude close by the moon
Thither full fraught with mischievous revenge
Accursed and in a cursed hour he hies



Book III


Hail holy Light offspring of Heaven firstborn
Or of the Eternal coeternal beam
May I express thee unblamd?  since God is light
And never but in unapproached light
Dwelt from eternity dwelt then in thee
Bright effluence of bright essence increate
Or hear"st thou rather pure ethereal stream
Whose fountain who shall tell?  before the sun
Before the Heavens thou wert and at the voice
Of God as with a mantle didst invest  
The rising world of waters dark and deep
Won from the void and formless infinite
Thee I revisit now with bolder wing
Escapd the Stygian pool though long detaind
In that obscure sojourn while in my flight
Through utter and through middle darkness borne
With other notes than to the Orphean lyre
I sung of Chaos and eternal Night
Taught by the heavenly Muse to venture down
The dark descent and up to reascend
Though hard and rare  Thee I revisit safe
And feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou
Revisitst not these eyes that roll in vain
To find thy piercing ray and find no dawn
So  thick a drop serene hath quenchd their orbs
Or dim suffusion veild  Yet not the more
Cease I to wander where the Muses haunt
Clear spring or shady grove or sunny hill
Smit with the love of sacred song but chief
Thee Sion and the flowery brooks beneath
That wash thy hallowd feet and warbling flow
Nightly I visit  nor sometimes forget
So were I equalld with them in renown
Thy sovran command that Man should find grace
Blind Thamyris and blind Maeonides
And Tiresias and Phineus prophets old
Then feed on thoughts that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird
Sings darkling and in shadiest covert hid
Tunes her nocturnal note  Thus with the year
Seasons return but not to me returns
Day or the sweet approach of even or morn
Or sight of vernal bloom or summers rose
Or flocks or herds or human face divine
But cloud instead and everduring dark
Surrounds me from the cheerful ways of men
Cut off and for the book of knowledge fair
Presented with a universal blank
Of natures works to me expungd and rasd
And wisdom at one entrance quite shut out
So much the rather thou celestial Light
Shine inward and the mind through all her powers
Irradiate there plant eyes all mist from thence
Purge and disperse that I may see and tell
Of things invisible to mortal sight
Now had the Almighty Father from above
From the pure empyrean where he sits
High thrond above all highth bent down his eye
His own works and their works at once to view
About him all the Sanctities of Heaven
Stood thick as stars and from his sight receivd
Beatitude past utterance on his right
The radiant image of his glory sat
His only son on earth he first beheld
Our two first parents yet the only two
Of mankind in the happy garden placd
Reaping immortal fruits of joy and love
Uninterrupted joy unrivalld love
In blissful solitude he then surveyd
Hell and the gulf between and Satan there
Coasting the wall of Heaven on this side Night
In the dun air sublime and ready now
To stoop with wearied wings and willing feet
On the bare outside of this world that seemd
Firm land imbosomd without firmament
Uncertain which in ocean or in air
Him God beholding from his prospect high
Wherein past present future he beholds
Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake
Only begotten Son seest thou what rage
Transports our Adversary?  whom no bounds
Prescribd no bars of Hell nor all the chains
Heapd on him there nor yet the main abyss
Wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems
On desperate revenge that shall redound
Upon his own rebellious head  And now
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
Not far off Heaven in the precincts of light
Directly towards the new created world
And man there placd with purpose to assay
If him by force he can destroy or worse
By some false guile pervert and shall pervert
For man will hearken to his glozing lies
And easily transgress the sole command
Sole pledge of his obedience  So will fall
He and his faithless progeny  Whose fault?
Whose but his own?  ingrate he had of me
All he could have I made him just and right
Sufficient to have stood though free to fall
Such I created all the ethereal Powers
And Spirits both them who stood and them who faild
Freely they stood who stood and fell who fell
Not free what proof could they have given sincere
Of true allegiance constant faith or love
Where only what they needs must do appeard
Not what they would?  what praise could they receive?
What pleasure I from such obedience paid
When will and reason reason also is choice
Useless and vain of freedom both despoild
Made passive both had servd necessity
Not me?  they therefore as to rigIM TASUWI K
