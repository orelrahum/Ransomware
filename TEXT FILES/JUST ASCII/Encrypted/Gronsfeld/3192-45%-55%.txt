ROSALIND	O my dear Orlando how it grieves me to see thee
	wear thy heart in a scarf

ORLANDO	It is my arm

ROSALIND	I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
	of a lion

ORLANDO	Wounded it is but with the eyes of a lady

ROSALIND	Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
	swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?

ORLANDO	Ay and greater wonders than that

ROSALIND	O I know where you are nay tis true there was
	never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
	and Caesars thrasonical brag of I came saw and
	overcame for your brother and my sister no sooner
	met but they looked no sooner looked but they
	loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner
	sighed but they asked one another the reason no
	sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy
	and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
	to marriage which they will climb incontinent or
	else be incontinent before marriage they are in
	the very wrath of love and they will together clubs
	cannot part them

ORLANDO	They shall be married tomorrow and I will bid the
	duke to the nuptial But O how bitter a thing it
	is to look into happiness through another mans
	eyes By so much the more shall I tomorrow be at
	the height of heartheaviness by how much I shall
	think my brother happy in having what he wishes for

ROSALIND	Why then tomorrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?

	Know of me then for now I speak to some purpose
	that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit I
	speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
	of my knowledge insomuch I say I know you are
	neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
	some little measure draw a belief from you to do
	yourself good and not to grace me Believe then if
	you please that I can do strange things I have
	since I was three year old conversed with a
	magician most profound in his art and yet not
	damnable If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
	as your gesture cries it out when your brother
	marries Aliena shall you marry her I know into
	what straits of fortune she is driven and it is
	not impossible to me if it appear not inconvenient
	to you to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
	as she is and without any danger

ORLANDO	Speakest thou in sober meanings?

ROSALIND	By my life I do which I tender dearly though I
	say I am a magician Therefore put you in your
	best array bid your friends for if you will be
	married tomorrow you shall and to Rosalind if you will
