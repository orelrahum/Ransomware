The Angel ended and in Adams ear
So charming left his voice that he a while
Thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear
Then as new waked thus gratefully replied
What thanks sufficient or what recompence
Equal have I to render thee divine
Historian who thus largely hast allayed
The thirst I had of knowledge and vouchsafed
This friendly condescension to relate
Things else by me unsearchable now heard
With wonder but delight and as is due
With glory attributed to the high
Creator  Something yet of doubt remains
Which only thy solution can resolve
When I behold this goodly frame this world
Of Heaven and Earth consisting and compute
Their magnitudes this Earth a spot a grain
An atom with the firmament compared
And all her numbered stars that seem to roll
Spaces incomprehensible for such
Their distance argues and their swift return
Diurnal merely to officiate light
Round this opacous Earth this punctual spot
One day and night in all her vast survey
Useless besides reasoning I oft admire
How Nature wise and frugal could commit
Such disproportions with superfluous hand
So many nobler bodies to create
Greater so manifold to this one use
For aught appears and on their orbs impose
Such restless revolution day by day
Repeated while the sedentary Earth
That better might with far less compass move
Served by more noble than herself attains
Her end without least motion and receives
As tribute such a sumless journey brought
Of incorporeal speed her warmth and light
Speed to describe whose swiftness number fails
So spake our sire and by his countenance seemed
Entering on studious thoughts abstruse which Eve
Perceiving where she sat retired in sight
With lowliness majestick from her seat
And grace that won who saw to wish her stay
Rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers
To visit how they prospered bud and bloom
Her nursery they at her coming sprung
And touched by her fair tendance gladlier grew
Yet went she not as not with such discourse
Delighted or not capable her ear
Of what was high such pleasure she reserved
Adam relating she sole auditress
Her husband the relater she preferred
Before the Angel and of him to ask
Chose rather he she knew would intermix
Grateful digressions and solve high dispute
With conjugal caresses from his lip
Not words alone pleased her  O when meet now
Such pairs in love and mutual honour joined?
With Goddesslike demeanour forth she went
Not unattended for on her as Queen
A pomp of winning Graces waited still
And from about her shot darts of desire
Into all eyes to wish her still in sight
And Raphael now to Adams doubt proposed
Benevolent and facile thus replied
To ask or search I blame thee not for Heaven
Is as the book of God before thee set
Wherein to read his wonderous works and learn
His seasons hours or days or months or years
This to attain whether Heaven move or Earth
Imports not if thou reckon right the rest
From Man or Angel the great Architect
Did wisely to conceal and not divulge
His secrets to be scanned by them who ought
Rather admire or if they list to try
Conjecture he his fabrick of the Heavens
Hath left to their disputes perhaps to move
His laughter at their quaint opinions wide
Hereafter when they come to model Heaven
And calculate the stars how they will wield
The mighty frame how build unbuild contrive
To save appearances how gird the sphere
With centrick and eccentrick scribbled oer
Cycle and epicycle orb in orb
Already by thy reasoning this I guess
Who art to lead thy offspring and supposest
That bodies bright and greater should not serve
The less not bright nor Heaven such journeys run
Earth sitting still when she alone receives
The benefit  Consider first that great
Or bright infers not excellence the Earth
Though in comparison of Heaven so small
Nor glistering may of solid good contain
More plenty than the sun that barren shines
Whose virtue on itself works no effect
But in the fruitful Earth there first received
His beams unactive else their vigour find
Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries
Officious but to thee Earths habitant
And for the Heavens wide circuit let it speak
The Makers high magnificence who built
So spacious and his line stretched out so far
That Man may know he dwells not in his own
An edifice too large for him to fill
Lodged in a small partition and the rest
Ordained for uses to his Lord best known
The swiftness of those circles attribute
Though numberless to his Omnipotence
That to corporeal substances could add
Speed almost spiritual  Me thou thinkest not slow
Who since the morninghour set out from Heaven
Where God resides and ere midday arrived
In Eden distance inexpressible
By numbers that have name  But this I urge
Admitting motion in the Heavens to show
Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved
Not that I so affirm though so it seem
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth
God to remove his ways from human sense
Placed Heaven from Earth so far that earthly sight
If it presume might err in things too high
And no advantage gain  What if the sun
Be center to the world and other stars
By his attractive virtue and their own
Incited dance about him various rounds?
Their wandering course now high now low then hid
Progressive retrograde or standing still
In six thou seest and what if seventh to these
The planet earth so stedfast though she seem
Insensibly three different motions move?
Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe
Moved contrary with thwart obliquities
Or save the sun his labour and that swift
Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed
Invisible else above all stars the wheel
Of day and night which needs not thy belief
If earth industrious of herself fetch day
Travelling east and with her part averse
From the suns beam meet night her other part
Still luminous by his ray  What if that light
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air
To the terrestrial moon be as a star
Enlightening her by day as she by night
This earth? reciprocal if land be there
Fields and inhabitants  Her spots thou seest
As clouds and clouds may rain and rain produce
Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat
Allotted there and other suns perhaps
With their attendant moons thou wilt descry
Communicating male and female light
Which two great sexes animate the world
Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed
By living soul desart and desolate
Only to shine yet scarce to contribute
Each orb a glimpse of light conveyed so far
Down to this habitable which returns
Light back to them is obvious to dispute
But whether thus these things or whether not
But whether the sun predominant in Heaven
Rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun
He from the east his flaming road begin
Or she from west her silent course advance
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
On her soft axle while she paces even
And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid
Leave them to God above him serve and fear
Of other creatures as him pleases best
Wherever placed let him dispose joy thou
In what he gives to thee this Paradise
And thy fair Eve Heaven is for thee too high
To know what passes there be lowly wise
Think only what concerns thee and thy being
Dream not of other worlds what creatures there
Live in what state condition or degree
Contented that thus far hath been revealed
Not of Earth only but of highest Heaven
To whom thus Adam cleared of doubt replied
How fully hast thou satisfied me pure
Intelligence of Heaven Angel serene
And freed from intricacies taught to live
The easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts
To interrupt the sweet of life from which
God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares
And not molest us unless we ourselves
Seek them with wandering thoughts and notions vain
But apt the mind or fancy is to rove
Unchecked and of her roving is no end
Till warned or by experience taught she learn
That not to know at large of things remote
From use obscure and subtle but to know
That which before us lies in daily life
Is the prime wisdom  What is more is fume
Or emptiness or fond impertinence
And renders us in things that most concern
Unpractised unprepared and still to seek
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
A lower flight and speak of things at hand
Useful whence haply mention may arise
Of something not unseasonable to ask
By sufferance and thy wonted favour deigned
Thee I have heard relating what was done
Ere my remembrance now hear me relate
My story which perhaps thou hast not heard
And day is not yet spent till then thou seest
How subtly to detain thee I devise
Inviting thee to hear while I relate
Fond were it not in hope of thy reply
For while I sit with thee I seem in Heaven
And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear
Than fruits of palmtree pleasantest to thirst
And hunger both from labour at the hour
Of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill
Though pleasant but thy words with grace divine
Imbued bring to their sweetness no satiety
To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek
Nor are thy lips ungraceful Sire of men
Nor tongue ineloquent for God on thee
Abundantly his gifts hath also poured
Inward and outward both his image fair
Speaking or mute all comeliness and grace
Attends thee and each word each motion forms
Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth
Than of our fellowservant and inquire
Gladly into the ways of God with Man
For God we see hath honoured thee and set
On Man his equal love  Say therefore on
For I that day was absent as befel
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure
Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell
Squared in full legion such command we had
To see that none thence issued forth a spy
Or enemy while God was in his work
Lest he incensed at such eruption bold
Destruction with creation might have mixed
Not that they durst without his leave attempt
But us he sends upon his high behests
For state as Sovran King and to inure
Our prompt obedience  Fast we found fast shut
The dismal gates and barricadoed strong
But long ere our approaching heard within
Noise other than the sound of dance or song
Torment and loud lament and furious rage
Glad we returned up to the coasts of light
Ere sabbathevening so we had in charge
But thy relation now for I attend
Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine
So spake the Godlike Power and thus our Sire
For Man to tell how human life began
Is hard for who himself beginning knew
Desire with thee still longer to converse
Induced me  As new waked from soundest sleep
Soft on the flowery herb I found me laid
In balmy sweat which with his beams the sun
Soon dried and on the reeking moisture fed
Straight toward Heaven my wondering eyes I turned
And gazed a while the ample sky till raised
By quick instinctive motion up I sprung
As thitherward endeavouring and upright
Stood on my feet about me round I saw
Hill dale and shady woods and sunny plains
And liquid lapse of murmuring streams by these
Creatures that lived and moved and walked or flew
Birds on the branches warbling all things smiled
With fragrance and with joy my heart oerflowed
Myself I then perused and limb by limb
Surveyed and sometimes went and sometimes ran
With supple joints as lively vigour led
But who I was or where or from what cause
Knew not to speak I tried and forthwith spake
My tongue obeyed and readily could name
Whateer I saw  Thou Sun said I fair light
And thou enlightened Earth so fresh and gay
Ye Hills and Dales ye Rivers Woods and Plains
And ye that live and move fair Creatures tell
Tell if ye saw how I came thus how here?
Not of myselfby some great Maker then
In goodness and in power preeminent
Tell me how may I know him how adore
From whom I have that thus I move and live
And feel that I am happier than I know
While thus I called and strayed I knew not whither
From where I first drew air and first beheld
This happy light when answer none returned
On a green shady bank profuse of flowers
Pensive I sat me down  There gentle sleep
First found me and with soft oppression seised
My droused sense untroubled though I thought
I then was passing to my former state
Insensible and forthwith to dissolve
When suddenly stood at my head a dream
Whose inward apparition gently moved
My fancy to believe I yet had being
And lived  One came methought of shape divine
And said Thy mansion wants thee Adam rise
First Man of men innumerable ordained
First Father called by thee I come thy guide
To the garden of bliss thy seat prepared
So saying by the hand he took me raised
And over fields and waters as in air
Smoothsliding without step last led me up
A woody mountain whose high top was plain
A circuit wide enclosed with goodliest trees
Planted with walks and bowers that what I saw
Of Earth before scarce pleasant seemed  Each tree
Loaden with fairest fruit that hung to the eye
Tempting stirred in me sudden appetite
To pluck and eat whereat I waked and found
Before mine eyes all real as the dream
Had lively shadowed  Here had new begun
My wandering had not he who was my guide
Up hither from among the trees appeared
Presence Divine  Rejoicing but with awe
In adoration at his feet I fell
Submiss  He reared me and Whom thou soughtest I am
Said mildly Author of all this thou seest
Above or round about thee or beneath
This Paradise I give thee count it thine
To till and keep and of the fruit to eat
Of every tree that in the garden grows
Eat freely with glad heart fear here no dearth
But of the tree whose operation brings
Knowledge of good and ill which I have set
The pledge of thy obedience and thy faith
Amid the garden by the tree of life
Remember what I warn thee shun to taste
And shun the bitter consequence for know
The day thou eatest thereof my sole command
Transgressed inevitably thou shalt die
From that day mortal and this happy state
Shalt lose expelled from hence into a world
Of woe and sorrow  Sternly he pronounced
The rigid interdiction which resounds
Yet dreadful in mine ear though in my choice
Not to incur but soon his clear aspect
Returned and gracious purpose thus renewed
Not only these fair bounds but all the Earth
To thee and to thy race I give as lords
Possess it and all things that therein live
Or live in sea or air beast fish and fowl
In sign whereof each bird and beast behold
After their kinds I bring them to receive
From thee their names and pay thee fealty
With low subjection understand the same
Of fish within their watery residence
Not hither summoned since they cannot change
Their element to draw the thinner air
As thus he spake each bird and beast behold
Approaching two and two these cowering low
With blandishment each bird stooped on his wing
I named them as they passed and understood
Their nature with such knowledge God endued
My sudden apprehension  But in these
I found not what methought I wanted still
And to the heavenly Vision thus presumed
O by what name for thou above all these
Above mankind or aught than mankind higher
Surpassest far my naming how may I
Adore thee Author of this universe
And all this good to man? for whose well being
So amply and with hands so liberal
Thou hast provided all things  But with me
I see not who partakes  In solitude
What happiness who can enjoy alone
Or all enjoying what contentment find?
Thus I presumptuous and the Vision bright
As with a smile more brightened thus replied
What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth
With various living creatures and the air
Replenished and all these at thy command
To come and play before thee?  Knowest thou not
Their language and their ways?  They also know
And reason not contemptibly  With these
Find pastime and bear rule thy realm is large
So spake the Universal Lord and seemed
So ordering  I with leave of speech implored
And humble deprecation thus replied
Let not my words offend thee Heavenly Power
My Maker be propitious while I speak
Hast thou not made me here thy substitute
And these inferiour far beneath me set?
Among unequals what society
Can sort what harmony or true delight?
Which must be mutual in proportion due
Given and received but in disparity
The one intense the other still remiss
Cannot well suit with either but soon prove
Tedious alike  Of fellowship I speak
Such as I seek fit to participate
All rational delight wherein the brute
Cannot be human consort  They rejoice
Each with their kind lion with lioness
So fitly them in pairs thou hast combined
Much less can bird with beast or fish with fowl
So well converse nor with the ox the ape
Worse then can man with beast and least of all
Whereto the Almighty answered not displeased
A nice and subtle happiness I see
Thou to thyself proposest in the choice
Of thy associates Adam and wilt taste
No pleasure though in pleasure solitary
What thinkest thou then of me and this my state?
Seem I to thee sufficiently possessed
Of happiness or not? who am alone
From all eternity for none I know
Second to me or like equal much less
How have I then with whom to hold converse
Save with the creatures which I made and those
To me inferiour infinite descents
Beneath what other creatures are to thee?
He ceased I lowly answered  To attain
The highth and depth of thy eternal ways
All human thoughts come short Supreme of things
Thou in thyself art perfect and in thee
Is no deficience found  Not so is Man
But in degree the cause of his desire
By conversation with his like to help
Or solace his defects  No need that thou
Shouldst propagate already Infinite
And through all numbers absolute though One
But Man by number is to manifest
His single imperfection and beget
Like of his like his image multiplied
In unity defective which requires
Collateral love and dearest amity
Thou in thy secresy although alone
Best with thyself accompanied seekest not
Social communication yet so pleased
Canst raise thy creature to what highth thou wilt
Of union or communion deified
I by conversing cannot these erect
From prone nor in their ways complacence find
Thus I emboldened spake and freedom used
Permissive and acceptance found which gained
This answer from the gracious Voice Divine
Thus far to try thee Adam I was pleased
And find thee knowing not of beasts alone
Which thou hast rightly named but of thyself
Expressing well the spirit within thee free
My image not imparted to the brute
Whose fellowship therefore unmeet for thee
Good reason was thou freely shouldst dislike
And be so minded still  I ere thou spakest
Knew it not good for Man to be alone
And no such company as then thou sawest
Intended thee for trial only brought
To see how thou couldest judge of fit and meet
What next I bring shall please thee be assured
Thy likeness thy fit help thy other self
Thy wish exactly to thy hearts desire
He ended or I heard no more for now
My earthly by his heavenly overpowered
Which it had long stood under strained to the highth
In that celestial colloquy sublime
As with an object that excels the sense
Dazzled and spent sunk down and sought repair
Of sleep which instantly fell on me called
By Nature as in aid and closed mine eyes
Mine eyes he closed but open left the cell
Of fancy my internal sight by which
Abstract as in a trance methought I saw
Though sleeping where I lay and saw the shape
Still glorious before whom awake I stood
Who stooping opened my left side and took
From thence a rib with cordial spirits warm
And lifeblood streaming fresh wide was the wound
But suddenly with flesh filled up and healed
The rib he formed and fashioned with his hands
Under his forming hands a creature grew
Manlike but different sex so lovely fair
That what seemed fair in all the world seemed now
Mean or in her summed up in her contained
And in her looks which from that time infused
Sweetness into my heart unfelt before
And into all things from her air inspired
The spirit of love and amorous delight
She disappeared and left me dark I waked
To find her or for ever to deplore
Her loss and other pleasures all abjure
When out of hope behold her not far off
Such as I saw her in my dream adorned
With what all Earth or Heaven could bestow
To make her amiable  On she came
Led by her heavenly Maker though unseen
And guided by his voice nor uninformed
Of nuptial sanctity and marriage rites
Grace was in all her steps Heaven in her eye
In every gesture dignity and love
I overjoyed could not forbear aloud
This turn hath made amends thou hast fulfilled
Thy words Creator bounteous and benign
Giver of all things fair but fairest this
Of all thy gifts nor enviest  I now see
Bone of my bone flesh of my flesh myself
Before me  Woman is her nameof Man
Extracted for this cause he shall forego
Father and mother and to his wife adhere
And they shall be one flesh one heart one soul
She heard me thus and though divinely brought
Yet innocence and virgin modesty
Her virtue and the conscience of her worth
That would be wooed and not unsought be won
Not obvious not obtrusive but retired
The more desirable or to say all
Nature herself though pure of sinful thought
Wrought in her so that seeing me she turned
I followed her she what was honour knew
And with obsequious majesty approved
My pleaded reason  To the nuptial bower
I led her blushing like the morn All Heaven
And happy constellations on that hour
Shed their selectest influence the Earth
Gave sign of gratulation and each hill
Joyous the birds fresh gales and gentle airs
Whispered it to the woods and from their wings
Flung rose flung odours from the spicy shrub
Disporting till the amorous bird of night
Sung spousal and bid haste the eveningstar
On his hill top to light the bridal lamp
Thus have I told thee all my state and brought
My story to the sum of earthly bliss
Which I enjoy and must confess to find
In all things else delight indeed but such
As used or not works in the mind no change
Nor vehement desire these delicacies
I mean of taste sight smell herbs fruits and flowers
Walks and the melody of birds but here
Far otherwise transported I behold
Transported touch here passion first I felt
Commotion strange in all enjoyments else
Superiour and unmoved here only weak
Against the charm of Beautys powerful glance
Or Nature failed in me and left some part
Not proof enough such object to sustain
Or from my side subducting took perhaps
More than enough at least on her bestowed
Too much of ornament in outward show
Elaborate of inward less exact
For well I understand in the prime end
Of Nature her the inferiour in the mind
And inward faculties which most excel
In outward also her resembling less
His image who made both and less expressing
The character of that dominion given
Oer other creatures  Yet when I approach
Her loveliness so absolute she seems
And in herself complete so well to know
Her own that what she wills to do or say
Seems wisest virtuousest discreetest best
All higher knowledge in her presence falls
Degraded  Wisdom in discourse with her
Loses discountenanced and like Folly shows
Authority and Reason on her wait
As one intended first not after made
Occasionally and to consummate all
Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat
Build in her loveliest and create an awe
About her as a guard angelick placed
To whom the Angel with contracted brow
Accuse not Nature she hath done her part
Do thou but thine and be not diffident
Of Wisdom she deserts thee not if thou
Dismiss not her when most thou needest her nigh
By attributing overmuch to things
Less excellent as thou thyself perceivest
For what admirest thou what transports thee so
An outside? fair no doubt and worthy well
Thy cherishing thy honouring and thy love
Not thy subjection  Weigh with her thyself
Then value  Ofttimes nothing profits more
Than selfesteem grounded on just and right
Well managed of that skill the more thou knowest
The more she will acknowledge thee her head
And to realities yield all her shows
Made so adorn for thy delight the more
So awful that with honour thou mayest love
Thy mate who sees when thou art seen least wise
But if the sense of touch whereby mankind
Is propagated seem such dear delight
Beyond all other think the same vouchsafed
To cattle and each beast which would not be
To them made common and divulged if aught
Therein enjoyed were worthy to subdue
The soul of man or passion in him move
What higher in her society thou findest
Attractive human rational love still
In loving thou dost well in passion not
Wherein true love consists not  Love refines
The thoughts and heart enlarges hath his seat
In reason and is judicious is the scale
By which to heavenly love thou mayest ascend
Not sunk in carnal pleasure for which cause
Among the beasts no mate for thee was found
To whom thus half abashed Adam replied
Neither her outside formed so fair nor aught
In procreation common to all kinds
Though higher of the genial bed by far
And with mysterious reverence I deem
So much delights me as those graceful acts
Those thousand decencies that daily flow
From all her words and actions mixed with love
And sweet compliance which declare unfeigned
Union of mind or in us both one soul
Harmony to behold in wedded pair
More grateful than harmonious sound to the ear
Yet these subject not I to thee disclose
What inward thence I feel not therefore foiled
Who meet with various objects from the sense
Variously representing yet still free
Approve the best and follow what I approve
To love thou blamest me not for Love thou sayest
Leads up to Heaven is both the way and guide
Bear with me then if lawful what I ask
Love not the heavenly Spirits and how their love
Express they? by looks only? or do they mix
Irradiance virtual or immediate touch?
To whom the Angel with a smile that glowed
Celestial rosy red Loves proper hue
Answered  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest
Us happy and without love no happiness
Whatever pure thou in the body enjoyest
And pure thou wert created we enjoy
In eminence and obstacle find none
Of membrane joint or limb exclusive bars
Easier than air with air if Spirits embrace
Total they mix union of pure with pure
Desiring nor restrained conveyance need
As flesh to mix with flesh or soul with soul
But I can now no more the parting sun
Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles
Hesperian sets my signal to depart
Be strong live happy and love  But first of all
Him whom to love is to obey and keep
His great command take heed lest passion sway
Thy judgement to do aught which else free will
Would not admit thine and of all thy sons
The weal or woe in thee is placed beware
I in thy persevering shall rejoice
And all the Blest  Stand fastto stand or fall
Free in thine own arbitrement it lies
Perfect within no outward aid require
And all temptation to transgress repel
So saying he arose whom Adam thus
Followed with benediction  Since to part
Go heavenly guest ethereal Messenger
Sent from whose sovran goodness I adore
Gentle to me and affable hath been
Thy condescension and shall be honoured ever
With grateful memory  Thou to mankind
Be good and friendly still and oft return
So parted they the Angel up to Heaven
From the thick shade and Adam to his bower



Book IX


No more of talk where God or Angel guest
With Man as with his friend familiar usd
To sit indulgent and with him partake
Rural repast permitting him the while
Venial discourse unblamd I now must change
Those notes to tragick foul distrust and breach
Disloyal on the part of Man revolt
And disobedience on the part of Heaven
Now alienated distance and distaste
Anger and just rebuke and judgement given
That brought into this world a world of woe
Sin and her shadow Death and Misery
Deaths harbinger Sad talkyet argument
Not less but more heroick than the wrath
Of stern Achilles on his foe pursued
Thrice fugitive about Troy wall or rage
Of Turnus for Lavinia disespousd
Or Neptunes ire or Junos that so long
Perplexed the Greek and Cythereas son

   
If answerable style I can obtain
Of my celestial patroness who deigns
Her nightly visitation unimplord
And dictates to me slumbering or inspires
Easy my unpremeditated verse
Since first this subject for heroick song
Pleasd me long choosing and beginning late
Not sedulous by nature to indite
Wars hitherto the only argument
Heroick deemd chief mastery to dissect
With long and tedious havock fabled knights
In battles feignd the better fortitude
Of patience and heroick martyrdom
Unsung or to describe races and games
Or tilting furniture imblazond shields
Impresses quaint caparisons and steeds
Bases and tinsel trappings gorgeous knights
At joust and tournament then marshalld feast
Servd up in hall with sewers and seneshals
The skill of artifice or office mean
Not that which justly gives heroick name
To person or to poem  Me of these
Nor skilld nor studious higher argument
Remains sufficient of itself to raise
That name unless an age too late or cold
Climate or years damp my intended wing
Depressd and much they may if all be mine
Not hers who brings it nightly to my ear
The sun was sunk and after him the star
Of Hesperus whose office is to bring
Twilight upon the earth short arbiter
"twixt day and night and now from end to end
Nights hemisphere had veild the horizon round
When satan who late fled before the threats
Of Gabriel out of Eden now improvd
In meditated fraud and malice bent
On Mans destruction maugre what might hap
Of heavier on himself fearless returned
From compassing the earth cautious of day
Since Uriel regent of the sun descried
His entrance and foreworned the Cherubim
That kept their watch thence full of anguish driven
The space of seven continued nights he rode
With darkness thrice the equinoctial line
He circled four times crossed the car of night
From pole to pole traversing each colure
On the eighth returned and on the coast averse
From entrance or Cherubick watch by stealth
Found unsuspected way  There was a place
Now not though sin not time first wrought the change
Where Tigris at the foot of Paradise
Into a gulf shot under ground till part
Rose up a fountain by the tree of life
In with the river sunk and with it rose
Satan involved in rising mist then sought
Where to lie hid sea he had searched and land
From Eden over Pontus and the pool
Maeotis up beyond the river Ob
Downward as far antarctick and in length
West from Orontes to the ocean barred
At Darien  thence to the land where flows
Ganges and Indus Thus the orb he roamed
With narrow search and with inspection deep
Considered every creature which of all
Most opportune might serve his wiles and found
The Serpent subtlest beast of all the field
Him after long debate irresolute
Of thoughts revolved his final sentence chose
Fit vessel fittest imp of fraud in whom
To enter and his dark suggestions hide
From sharpest sight for in the wily snake
Whatever sleights none would suspicious mark
As from his wit and native subtlety
Proceeding which in other beasts observed
Doubt might beget of diabolick power
Active within beyond the sense of brute
Thus he resolved but first from inward grief
His bursting passion into plaints thus poured
More justly seat worthier of Gods as built
With second thoughts reforming what was old
O Earth how like to Heaven if not preferred
For what God after better worse would build?
Terrestrial Heaven danced round by other Heavens
That shine yet bear their bright officious lamps
Light above light for thee alone as seems
In thee concentring all their precious beams
Of sacred influence  As God in Heaven
Is center yet extends to all so thou
Centring receivest from all those orbs in thee
Not in themselves all their known virtue appears
Productive in herb plant and nobler birth
Of creatures animate with gradual life
Of growth sense reason all summed up in Man
With what delight could I have walked thee round
If I could joy in aught sweet interchange
Of hill and valley rivers woods and plains
Now land now sea and shores with forest crowned
Rocks dens and caves  But I in none of these
Find place or refuge and the more I see
Pleasures about me so much more I feel
Torment within me as from the hateful siege
Of contraries all good to me becomes
Bane and in Heaven much worse would be my state
But neither here seek I no nor in Heaven
To dwell unless by mastering Heavens Supreme
Nor hope to be myself less miserable
By what I seek but others to make such
As I though thereby worse to me redound
For only in destroying I find ease
To my relentless thoughts and him destroyed
Or won to what may work his utter loss
For whom all this was made all this will soon
Follow as to him linked in weal or woe
In woe then that destruction wide may range
To me shall be the glory sole among
The infernal Powers in one day to have marred
What he Almighty styled six nights and days
Continued making and who knows how long
Before had been contriving? though perhaps
Not longer than since I in one night freed
From servitude inglorious well nigh half
The angelick name and thinner left the throng
Of his adorers He to be avenged
And to repair his numbers thus impaired
Whether such virtue spent of old now failed
More Angels to create if they at least
Are his created or to spite us more
Determined to advance into our room
A creature formed of earth and him endow
Exalted from so base original
With heavenly spoils our spoils What he decreed
He effected Man he made and for him built
Magnificent this world and earth his seat
Him lord pronounced and O indignity
Subjected to his service angelwings
And flaming ministers to watch and tend
Their earthly charge Of these the vigilance
I dread and to elude thus wrapt in mist
Of midnight vapour glide obscure and pry
In every bush and brake where hap may find
The serpent sleeping in whose mazy folds
To hide me and the dark intent I bring
O foul descent that I who erst contended
With Gods to sit the highest am now constrained
Into a beast and mixed with bestial slime
This essence to incarnate and imbrute
That to the highth of Deity aspired
But what will not ambition and revenge
Descend to?  Who aspires must down as low
As high he soared obnoxious first or last
To basest things  Revenge at first though sweet
Bitter ere long back on itself recoils
Let it I reck not so it light well aimed
Since higher I fall short on him who next
Provokes my envy this new favourite
Of Heaven this man of clay son of despite
Whom us the more to spite his Maker raised
From dust Spite then with spite is best repaid
So saying through each thicket dank or dry
Like a black mist lowcreeping he held on
His midnightsearch where soonest he might find
The serpent him fastsleeping soon he found
In labyrinth of many a round selfrolled
His head the midst well stored with subtile wiles
Not yet in horrid shade or dismal den
Nor nocent yet but on the grassy herb
Fearless unfeared he slept in at his mouth
The Devil entered and his brutal sense
In heart or head possessing soon inspired
With act intelligential but his sleep
Disturbed not waiting close the approach of morn
Now when as sacred light began to dawn
In Eden on the humid flowers that breathed
Their morning incense when all things that breathe
From the Earths great altar send up silent praise
To the Creator and his nostrils fill
With grateful smell forth came the human pair
And joined their vocal worship to the quire
Of creatures wanting voice that done partake
The season prime for sweetest scents and airs
Then commune how that day they best may ply
Their growing work for much their work outgrew
The hands dispatch of two gardening so wide
And Eve first to her husband thus began
Adam well may we labour still to dress
This garden still to tend plant herb and flower
Our pleasant task enjoined but till more hands
Aid us the work under our labour grows
Luxurious by restraint what we by day
Lop overgrown or prune or prop or bind
One night or two with wanton growth derides
Tending to wild  Thou therefore now advise
Or bear what to my mind first thoughts present
Let us divide our labours thou where choice
Leads thee or where most needW ZMIAQMW BQ WRVH
