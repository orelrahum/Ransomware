Paraguay Economy

Overview
    Agriculture including forestry accounts for about  of GDP employs
    about  of the labor force and provides the bulk of exports Paraguay has
    no known significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
    hydropower potential Since  economic performance has declined compared
    with the boom period of  when real GDP grew at an average annual
    rate of nearly  During the period  real GDP fell in three of five
    years inflation jumped to an annual rate of  and foreign debt rose
    Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the
    completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam bad weather for crops and weak
    international commodity prices for agricultural exports In  the economy
    experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and
    stronger international prices for key agricultural exports The recovery
    continued through  on the strength of bumper crops in  In a
    major step to increase its economic activity in the region Paraguay in
    March  joined the Southern Cone Common Market MERCOSUR which includes
    Brazil Argentina and Uruguay During  the government began to more
    seriously address its arrearages with international creditors and its
    domestic fiscal problems Inflation was cut in third but the foreign trade
    deficit widened to more than  billion For the long run the government
    must press forward with general marketoriented economic reforms

Peru Economy

Overview
    The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented with a large
    dose of government ownership remaining in mining energy and banking In
    the s the economy suffered from hyperinflation declining per capita
    output and mounting external debt Peru was shut off from IMF and World
    Bank support in the mids because of its huge debt arrears An austerity
    program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in
    July  contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
    activity but the slide halted late in the year and output rose  in
     After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
    government price subsidies monthly price increases eased to the
    singledigit level and by December  dropped to the lowest increase since
    mid Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
    in September  and although it faces  billion in arrears on its
    external debt is working to pay some  billion of these to the IMF and
    World Bank by
