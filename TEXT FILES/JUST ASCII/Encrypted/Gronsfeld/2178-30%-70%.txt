West Bank Header

Note
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June  ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Sinai and the Golan
    Heights As stated in the  Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bushs postGulf crisis peace initiative the final status of the
    West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined In the view of the US the term West Bank
    describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian
    administration before the  ArabIsraeli war However with respect to
    negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement it is US policy that a
    distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank
    because of the citys special status and circumstances Therefore a
    negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in
    character from that of the rest of the West Bank

    These negotiations will determine how the area is to governed

West Bank Economy

Overview
    Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military
    administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising intifadah
    Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have
    been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli
    policies Capital investment consists largely of residential housing not
    productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli
    industry A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers
    employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states but such transfers from the Gulf
    dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August  In the wake
    of the Persian Gulf crisis many Palestinians have returned to the West
    Bank increasing unemployment and export revenues have plunged because of
    the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states Israeli measures to
    curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living
    standards The areas economic outlook remains bleak
