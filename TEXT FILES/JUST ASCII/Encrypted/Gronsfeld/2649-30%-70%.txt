Compulsion thus transported to forget
What hither brought us hate not lovenor hope
Of Paradise for Hell hope here to taste
Of pleasure but all pleasure to destroy
Save what is in destroying other joy
To me is lost  Then let me not let pass
Occasion which now smiles behold alone
The woman opportune to all attempts
Her husband for I view far round not nigh
Whose higher intellectual more I shun
And strength of courage haughty and of limb
Heroick built though of terrestrial mould
Foe not informidable exempt from wound
I not so much hath Hell debased and pain
Enfeebled me to what I was in Heaven
She fair divinely fair fit love for Gods
Not terrible though terrour be in love
And beauty not approached by stronger hate
Hate stronger under show of love well feigned
The way which to her ruin now I tend
So spake the enemy of mankind enclosed
In serpent inmate bad and toward Eve
Addressed his way not with indented wave
Prone on the ground as since but on his rear
Circular base of rising folds that towered
Fold above fold a surging maze his head
Crested aloft and carbuncle his eyes
With burnished neck of verdant gold erect
Amidst his circling spires that on the grass
Floated redundant pleasing was his shape
And lovely never since of serpentkind
Lovelier not those that in Illyria changed
Hermione and Cadmus or the god
In Epidaurus nor to which transformed
Ammonian Jove or Capitoline was seen
He with Olympias this with her who bore
Scipio the highth of Rome  With tract oblique
At first as one who sought access but feared
To interrupt sidelong he works his way
As when a ship by skilful steersmen wrought
Nigh rivers mouth or foreland where the wind
Veers oft as oft so steers and shifts her sail
So varied he and of his tortuous train
Curled many a wanton wreath in sight of Eve
To lure her eye she busied heard the sound
Of rusling leaves but minded not as used
To such disport before her through the field
From every beast more duteous at her call
Than at Circean call the herd disguised
He bolder now uncalled before her stood
But as in gaze admiring oft he bowed
His turret crest and sleek enamelled neck
Fawning and licked the ground whereon she trod
His gentle dumb expression turned at length
The eye of Eve to mark his play he glad
Of her attention gained with serpenttongue
Organick or impulse of vocal air
His fraudulent temptation thus bLPIS
