Mongolia Economy

Overview
    Mongolias severe climate scattered population and wide expanses of
    unproductive land have constrained economic development Economic activity
    traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock 
    Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world In
    recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet
    support The mining and processing of coal copper molybdenum tin
    tungsten and gold account for a large part of industrial production Timber
    and fishing are also important sectors In  Mongolian leadership is
    struggling with severe economic dislocations mainly attributable to the
    economic crumbling of the USSR by far Mongolias leading trade and
    development partner Moscow almost certainly cut aid in  and the
    dissolution of the USSR at yearend  makes prospects for aid quite bleak
    for  Industry in  has been hit hard by energy shortages mainly
    due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports
    The government is moving away from the Sovietstyle centrally planned
    economy through privatization and price reform
