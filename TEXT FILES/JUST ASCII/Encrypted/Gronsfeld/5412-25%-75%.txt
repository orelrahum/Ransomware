innovations that are currently available and on the drawing board will
soon revolutionize historical research and the production of historical
documents  Unfortunately much of this new technology is not being used
in the planning stages of historical projects simply because many
historians are aware only in the vaguest way of its existence  At least
two major new historical editing projects are considering microfilm
editions simply because they are not aware of the possibilities of
electronic alternatives and the advantages of the new technology in terms
of flexibility and research potential compared to microfilm  In fact
too many of us in history and literature are still at the stage of
struggling with our PCs  There are many historical editorial projects in
progress presently and an equal number of literary projects  While the
two fields have somewhat different approaches to textual editing there
are ways in which electronic technology can be of service to both

Since few of the editors involved in the Founding Fathers CDROM editions
are technical experts in any sense I hope to point out in my discussion
of our experience how many of these electronic innovations can be used
successfully by scholars who are novices in the world of new technology
One of the major concerns of the sponsors of the multitude of new
scholarly editions is the limited audience reached by the published
volumes  Most of these editions are being published in small quantities
and the publishers price for them puts them out of the reach not only of
individual scholars but of most public libraries and all but the largest
educational institutions  However little attention is being given to
ways in which technology can bypass conventional publication to make
historical and literary documents more widely available

What attracted us most to the CDROM edition of The Papers of George
Washington was the fact that David Packards aim was to make a complete
edition of all of the  documents we have collected available in an
inexpensive format that would be placed in public libraries small
colleges and even high schools  This would provide an audience far
beyond our present copy  published edition  Since the CDROM
edition will carry none of the explanatory annotation that appears in the
published volumes we also feel that the use of the CDROM will lead many
researchers to seek out the published volumes

In addition to ignorance of new technical advances I have found that too
many editorsand historians and literary scholarsare resistant and
even hostile to suggestions that electronic technology may enhance their
work  I intend to discuss some of the arguments traditionalists are
advancing to resist technology ranging from distrust of the speed with
which it changes we are already wondering what is out there that is
better than CDROM to suspicion of the technical language used to
describe electronic developments

Cornell University Library Cornell Information Technologies and Xerox
Corporation with the support of the Commission on Preservation and
Access and Sun Microsystems Inc have been collaborating in a project
to test a prototype system for recording brittle books as digital images
and producing on demand highquality archival paper replacements  The
project goes beyond that however to investigate some of the issues
surrounding scanning storing retrieving and providing access to
digital images in a network environment

The Joint Study in Digital Preservation began in January   Xerox
provided the College Library Access and Storage System CLASS software
a prototype dotsperinch dpi scanner and the hardware necessary
to support network printing on the DocuTech printer housed in Cornells
Computing and Communications Center CCC

The Cornell staff using the hardware and software became an integral part
of the development and testing process for enhancements to the CLASS
software system  The collaborative nature of this relationship is
resulting in a system that is specifically tailored to the preservation
application

A digital library of  volumes or approximately  images has
been created and is stored on an optical jukebox that resides in CCC
The library includes a collection of select mathematics monographs that
provides mathematics faculty with an opportunity to use the electronic
library  The remaining volumes were chosen for the library to test the
various capabilities of the scanning system

One project objective is to provide users of the Cornell library and the
library staff with the ability to request facsimiles of digitized images
or to retrieve the actual electronic image for browsing  A prototype
viewing workstation has been created by Xerox with input into the design
by a committee of Cornell librarians and computer professionals  This
will allow us to experiment with patron access to the images that make up
the digital library  The viewing station provides search retrieval and
ultimately printing functions with enhancements to facilitate
navigation through multiple documents

Cornell currently is working to extend access to the digital library to
readers using workstations from their offices  This year is devoted to
the development of a network resident image conversion and delivery
server and client software that will support readers who use Apple
Macintosh computers IBM windows platforms and Sun workstations
Equipment for this development was provided by Sun Microsystems with
support from the Commission on Preservation and Access

During the showandtell session of the Workshop on Electronic Texts a
prototype view station will be demonstrated  In addition a display of
original library books that have been digitized will be available for
review with associated printed copies for comparison  The fifteenminute
overview of the project will include a slide presentation that
constitutes a "tour" of the preservation digitizing process

The final networkconnected version of the viewing station will provide
library users with another mechanism for accessing the digital library
and will also provide the capability of viewing images directly  This
will not require special software although a powerful computer with good
graphics will be needed

The Joint Study in Digital Preservation has generated a great deal of
interest in the library community  Unfortunately or perhaps
fortunately this project serves to raise a vast number of other issues
surrounding the use of digital technology for the preservation and use of
deteriorating library materials which subsequent projects will need to
examine  Much work remains

SESSION III

Howard BESSER                      Networking Multimedia Databases

What do we have to consider in building and distributing databases of
visual materials in a multiuser environment?  This presentation examines
a variety of concerns that need to be addressed before a multimedia
database can be set up in a networked environment

In the past it has not been feasible to implement databases of visual
materials in shareduser environments because of technological barriers
Each of the two basic models for multiuser multimedia databases has
posed its own problem  The analog multimedia storage model represented
by Project Athenas parallel analog and digital networks has required an
incredibly complex and expensive infrastructure  The economies of
scale that make multiuser setups cheaper per user served do not operate
in an environment that requires a computer workstation videodisc player
and two display devices for each user

The digital multimedia storage model has required vast amounts of storage
space as much as one gigabyte per thirty still images  In the past the
cost of such a large amount of storage space made this model a
prohibitive choice as well  But plunging storage costs are finally
making this second alternative viable

If storage no longer poses such an impediment what do we need to
consider in building digitally stored multiuser databases of visual
materials?  This presentation will examine the networking and
telecommunication constraints that must be overcome before such databases
can become commonplace and useful to a large number of people

The key problem is the vast size of multimedia documents and how this
affects not only storage but telecommunications transmission time
Anything slower than T speed is impractical for files of  megabyte or
larger which is likely to be small for a multimedia document  For
instance even on a  Kb line it would take three minutes to transfer a
megabyte file  And these figures assume ideal circumstances and do
not take into consideration other users contending for network bandwidth
disk access time or the time needed for remote display  Current common
telephone transmission rates would be completely impractical few users
would be willing to wait the hour necessary to transmit a single image at
 baud

This necessitates compression which itself raises a number of other
issues  In order to decrease file sizes significantly we must employ
lossy compression algorithms  But how much quality can we afford to
lose?  To date there has been only one significant study done of
imagequality needs for a particular user group and this study did not
look at loss resulting from compression  Only after identifying
imagequality needs can we begin to address storage and network bandwidth
needs

Experience with XWindowsbased applications such as Imagequery the
University of California at Berkeley image database demonstrates the
utility of a clientserver topology but also points to the limitation of
current software for a distributed environment  For example
applications like Imagequery can incorporate compression but current X
implementations do not permit decompression at the end users
workstation  Such decompression at the host computer alleviates storage
capacity problems while doing nothing to address problems of
telecommunications bandwidth

We need to examine the effects on network throughput of moving
multimedia documents around on a network  We need to examine various
topologies that will help us avoid bottlenecks around servers and
gateways  Experience with applications such as these raise still broader
questions How closely is the multimedia document tied to the software
for viewing it?  Can it be accessed and viewed from other applications?
Experience with the MARC format and more recently with the Z
protocols shows how useful it can be to store documents in a form in
which they can be accessed by a variety of application software

Finally from an intellectualaccess standpoint we need to address the
issue of providing access to these multimedia documents in
interdisciplinary environments  We need to examine terminology and
indexing strategies that will allow us to provide access to this material
in a crossdisciplinary way

Ronald LARSEN            Directions in HighPerformance Networking for
                         Libraries

The pace at which computing technology has advanced over the past forty
years shows no sign of abating  Roughly speaking each fiveyear period
has yielded an orderofmagnitude improvement in price and performance of
computing equipment  No fundamental hurdles are likely to prevent this
pace from continuing for at least the next decade  It is only in the
past five years though that computing has become ubiquitous in
libraries affecting all staff and patrons directly or indirectly

During these same five years communications rates on the Internet the
principal academic computing network have grown from  kbps to 
Mbps and the NSFNet backbone is now running  Mbps  Over the next five
years communication rates on the backbone are expected to exceed  Gbps
Growth in both the population of network users and the volume of network
traffic  has continued to grow geometrically at rates approaching 
percent per month  This flood of capacity and use likened by some to
"drinking from a firehose"  creates immense opportunities and challenges
for libraries  Libraries must anticipate the future implications of this
technology participate in its development and deploy it to ensure
access to the worlds information resources

The infrastructure for the information age is being put in place
Libraries face strategic decisions about their role in the development
deployment and use of this infrastructure  The emerging infrastructure
is much more than computers and communication lines  It is more than the
ability to compute at a remote site send electronic mail to a peer
across the country or move a file from one library to another  The next
five years will witness substantial development of the information
infrastructure of the network

In order to provide appropriate leadership library professionals must
have a fundamental understanding of and appreciation for computer
networking from local area networks to the National Research and
Education Network NREN  This presentation addresses these
fundamentals and how they relate to libraries today and in the near
future

Edwin BROWNRIGG               Electronic Library Visions and Realities

The electronic library has been a vision desired by manyand rejected by
somesince Vannevar Bush coined the term memex to describe an automated
intelligent personal information system  Variations on this vision have
included Ted Nelsons Xanadau Alan Kays Dynabook and Lancasters
"paperless library" with the most recent incarnation being the
"Knowledge Navigator" described by John Scully of Apple  But the reality
of library service has been less visionary and the leap to the electronic
library has eluded universities publishers and information technology
files

The Memex Research Institute MemRI an independent nonprofit research
and development organization has created an Electronic Library Program
of shared research and development in order to make the collective vision
more concrete  The program is working toward the creation of large
indexed publicly available electronic image collections of published
documents in academic special and public libraries  This strategic
plan is the result of the first stage of the program which has been an
investigation of the information technologies available to support such
an effort the economic parameters of electronic service compared to
traditional library operations and the business and political factors
affecting the shift from print distribution to electronic networked
access

The strategic plan envisions a combination of publicly searchable access
databases image and text document collections stored on network "file
servers" local and remote network access and an intellectual property
managementcontrol system  This combination of technology and
information content is defined in this plan as an Elibrary or Elibrary
collection  Some participating sponsors are already developing projects
based on MemRIs recommended directions

The Elibrary strategy projected in this plan is a visionary one that can
enable major changes and improvements in academic public and special
library service  This vision is though one that can be realized with
todays technology  At the same time it will challenge the political
and social structure within which libraries operate  in academic
libraries the traditional emphasis on local collections extending to
accreditation issues in public libraries the potential of electronic
branch and central libraries fully available to the public and for
special libraries new opportunities for shared collections and networks

The environment in which this strategic plan has been developed is at
the moment dominated by a sense of library limits  The continued
expansion and rapid growth of local academic library collections is now
clearly at an end  Corporate libraries and even law libraries are
faced with operating within a difficult economic climate as well as with
very active competition from commercial information sources  For
example public libraries may be seen as a desirable but not critical
municipal service in a time when the budgets of safety and health
agencies are being cut back

Further libraries in general have a very high labortocost ratio in
their budgets and labor costs are still increasing notwithstanding
automation investments  It is difficult for libraries to obtain capital
startup or seed funding for innovative activities and those
technologyintensive initiatives that offer the potential of decreased
labor costs can provoke the opposition of library staff

However libraries have achieved some considerable successes in the past
two decades by improving both their service and their credibility within
their organizationsand these positive changes have been accomplished
mostly with judicious use of information technologies  The advances in
computing and information technology have been wellchronicled  the
continuing precipitous drop in computing costs the growth of the
Internet and private networks and the explosive increase in publicly
available information databases

For example OCLC has become one of the largest computer network
organizations in the world by creating a cooperative cataloging network
of more than  libraries worldwide  Online public access catalogs
now serve millions of users on more than  dedicated terminals in
the United States alone  The University of California MELVYL online
catalog system has now expanded into an index database reference service
and supports more than six million searches a year  And libraries have
become the largest group of customers of CDROM publishing technology
more than  optical media publications such as those offered by
InfoTrac and Silver Platter are subscribed to by US libraries

This march of technology continues and in the next decade will result in
further innovations that are extremely difficult to predict  What is
clear is that libraries can now go beyond automation of their order files
and catalogs to automation of their collections themselvesand it is
possible to circumvent the fiscal limitations that appear to obtain
today

This Electronic Library Strategic Plan recommends a paradigm shift in
library service and demonstrates the steps necessary to provide improved
library services with limited capacities and operating investments

SESSION IVA

Anne KENNEY

The CornellXerox Joint Study in Digital Preservation resulted in the
recording of  brittle books as dpi digital images and the
production on demand of highquality and archivally sound paper
replacements  The project which was supported by the Commission on
Preservation and Access also investigated some of the issues surrounding
scanning storing retrieving and providing access to digital images in
a network environment

Anne Kenney will focus on some of the issues surrounding direct scanning
as identified in the Cornell Xerox Project  Among those to be discussed
are  image versus text capture indexing and access imagecapture
capabilities a comparison to photocopy and microfilm production and
cost analysis storage formats protocols and standards and the use of
this scanning technology for preservation purposes

The dpi digital images produced in the Cornell Xerox Project proved
highly acceptable for creating paper replacements of deteriorating
originals  The  scanned volumes provided an array of imagecapture
challenges that are common to nineteenthcentury printing techniques and
embrittled material and that defy the use of textconversion processes
These challenges include diminished contrast between text and background
fragile and deteriorated pages uneven printing elaborate type faces
faint and bold text adjacency handwritten text and annotations nonRoman
languages and a proliferation of illustrated material embedded in text
The latter category included highfrequency and lowfrequency halftones
continuous tone photographs intricate mathematical drawings maps
etchings reversepolarity drawings and engravings

The Xerox prototype scanning system provided a number of important
features for capturing this diverse material  Technicians used multiple
threshold settings filters line art and halftone definitions
autosegmentation windowing and softwareediting programs to optimize
image capture  At the same time this project focused on production
The goal was to make scanning as affordable and acceptable as
photocopying and microfilming for preservation reformatting  A
timeandcost study conducted during the last three months of this
project confirmed the economic viability of digital scanning and these
findings will be discussed here

From the outset the Cornell Xerox Project was predicated on the use of
nonproprietary standards and the use of common protocols when standards
did not exist  Digital files were created as TIFF images which were
compressed prior to storage using Group  CCITT compression  The Xerox
software is MS DOS based and utilizes offthe shelf programs such as
Microsoft Windows and Wang Image Wizard  The digital library is designed
to be hardwareindependent and to provide interchangeability with other
institutions through network connections  Access to the digital files
themselves is twotiered  Bibliographic records for the computer files
are created in RLIN and Cornells local system and access into the actual
digital images comprising a book is provided through a document control
structure and a networked image fileserver both of which will be
described

The presentation will conclude with a discussion of some of the issues
surrounding the use of this technology as a preservation tool storage
refreshing backup

Pamela ANDRE and Judith ZIDAR

The National Agricultural Library NAL has had extensive experience with
raster scanning of printed materials  Since  the Library has
participated in the National Agricultural Text Digitizing Project NATDP
a cooperative effort between NAL and fortyfive land grant university
libraries  An overview of the project will be presented giving its
history and NALs strategy for the future

An indepth discussion of NATDP will follow including a description of
the scanning process from the gathering of the printed materials to the
archiving of the electronic pages  The type of equipment required for a
standalone scanning workstation and the importance of file management
software will be discussed  Issues concerning the images themselves will
be addressed briefly such as image format black and white versus color
gray scale versus dithering and resolution

Also described will be a study currently in progress by NAL to evaluate
the usefulness of converting microfilm to electronic images in order to
improve access  With the cooperation of Tuskegee University NAL has
selected three reels of microfilm from a collection of sixtyseven reels
containing the papers letters and drawings of George Washington Carver
The three reels were converted into  electronic images using a
specialized microfilm scanner  The selection filming and indexing of
this material will be discussed

Donald WATERS

Project Open Book the Yale University Librarys effort to convert 
 books from microfilm to digital imagery is currently in an advanced
state of planning and organization  The Yale Library has selected a
major vendor to serve as a partner in the project and as systems
integrator  In its proposal the successful vendor helped isolate areas
of risk and uncertainty as well as key issues to be addressed during the
life of the project  The Yale Library is now poised to decide what
material it will convert to digital image form and to seek funding
initially for the first phase and then for the entire project

The proposal that Yale accepted for the implementation of Project Open
Book will provide at the end of three phases a conversion subsystem
browsing stations distributed on the campus network within the Yale
Library a subsystem for storing  books at  and  dots per
inch and network access to the image printers  Pricing for the system
implementation assumes the existence of Yales campus ethernet network
and its highspeed image printers and includes other requisite hardware
and software as well as system integration services  Proposed operating
costs include hardware and software maintenance but do not include
estimates for the facilities management of the storage devices and image
servers

Yale selected its vendor partner in a formal process partly funded by
the Commission for Preservation and Access  Following a request for
proposal the Yale Library selected two vendors as finalists to work with
Yale staff to generate a detailed analysis of requirements for Project
Open Book  Each vendor used the results of the requirements analysis to
generate and submit a formal proposal for the entire project  This
competitive process not only enabled the Yale Library to select its
primary vendor partner but also revealed much about the state of the
imaging industry about the varying corporate commitments to the markets
for imaging technology and about the varying organizational dynamics
through which major companies are responding to and seeking to develop
these markets

Project Open Book is focused specifically on the conversion of images
from microfilm to digital form  The technology for scanning microfilm is
readily available but is changing rapidly  In its project requirements
the Yale Library emphasized features of the technology that affect the
technical quality of digital image production and the costs of creating
and storing the image library  What levels of digital resolution can be
achieved by scanning microfilm?  How does variation in the quality of
microfilm particularly in film produced to preservation standards
affect the quality of the digital images?  What technologies can an
operator effectively and economically apply when scanning film to
separate twoup images and to control for and correct image
imperfections?  How can quality control best be integrated into
digitizing work flow that includes document indexing and storage?

The actual and expected uses of digital imagesstorage browsing
printing and OCRhelp determine the standards for measuring their
quality  Browsing is especially important but the facilities available
for readers to browse image documents is perhaps the weakest aspect of
imaging technology and most in need of development  As it defined its
requirements the Yale Library concentrated on some fundamental aspects
of usability for image documents  Does the system have sufficient
flexibility to handle the full range of document types including
monographs multipart and multivolume sets and serials as well as
manuscript collections?  What conventions are necessary to identify a
document uniquely for storage and retrieval?  Where is the database of
record for storing bibliographic information about the image document?
How are basic internal structures of documents such as pagination made
accessible to the reader?  How are the image documents physically
presented on the screen to the reader?

The Yale Library designed Project Open Book on the assumption that
microfilm is more than adequate as a medium for preserving the content of
deteriorated library materials  As planning in the project has advanced
it is increasingly clear that the challenge of digital image technology
and the key to the success of efforts like Project Open Book is to
provide a means of both preserving and improving access to those
deteriorated materials

SESSION IVB

George THOMA

In the use of electronic imaging for document preservation there are
several issues to consider such as  ensuring adequate image quality
maintaining substantial conversion rates throughput providing unique
identification for automated access and retrieval and accommodating
bound volumes and fragile material

To maintain high image quality image processing functions are required
to correct the deficiencies in the scanned image  Some commercially
available systems include these functions while some do not  The
scanned raw image must be processed to correct contrast deficiencies
both poor overall contrast resulting from light print andor dark
background and variable contrast resulting from stains and
bleedthrough  Furthermore the scan density must be adequate to allow
legibility of print and sufficient fidelity in the pseudohalftoned gray
material  Borders or pageedge effects must be removed for both
compactibility and aesthetics  Page skew must be corrected for aesthetic
reasons and to enable accurate character recognition if desired
Compound images consisting of both twotoned text and grayscale
illustrations must be processed appropriately to retain the quality of
each

Standards publications being developed by scientists engineers and
business managers in Association for Information and Image Management
AIIM standards committees can be applied to electronic image management
EIM processes including  document image transfer retrieval and
evaluation optical disk and document scanning and document design and
conversion  When combined with EIM system planning and operations
standards can assist in generating image databases that are
interchangeable among a variety of systems  The applications of
different approaches for imagetagging indexing compression and
transfer often cause uncertainty concerning EIM system compatibility
calibration performance and upward compatibility until standard
implementation parameters are established  The AIIM standards that are
being developed for these applications can be used to decrease the
uncertainty successfully integrate imaging processes and promote "open
systems"  AIIM is an accredited American National Standards Institute
ANSI standards developer with more than twenty committees comprised of
 volunteers representing users vendors and manufacturers  The
standards publications that are developed in these committees have
national acceptance and provide the basis for international harmonization
in the development of new International Organization for Standardization
ISO standards

This presentation describes the development of AIIMs EIM standards and a
new effort at AIIM a database on standards projects in a wide framework
of imaging industries including capture recording processing
duplication distribution display evaluation and preservation  The
AIIM Imagery Database will cover imaging standards being developed by
many organizations in many different countries  It will contain
standards publications dates origins related national and
international projects status key words and abstracts  The ANSI Image
Technology Standards Board requested that such a database be established
as did the ISOInternational Electrotechnical Commission Joint Task Force
on Imagery  AIIM will take on the leadership role for the database and
coordinate its development with several standards developers

     Characteristics of standards for digital imagery

           Nature of digital technology implies continuing volatility

           Precipitous standardsetting not possible and probably not
          desirable

           Standards are a complex issue involving the medium the
          hardware the software and the technical capacity for
          reproductive fidelity and clarity

           The prognosis for reliable archival standards as defined by
          librarians in the foreseeable future is poor

     Significant potential and attractiveness of digital technology as a
     preservation medium and access mechanism

     Productive use of digital imagery for preservation requires a
     reconceptualizing of preservation principles in a volatile
     standardless world

     Concept of managing continuing access in the digital environment
     rather than focusing on the permanence of the medium and longterm
     archival standards developed for the analog world

     Transition period  How long and what to do?

            Redefine "archival"

            Remove the burden of "archival copy" from paper artifacts

            Use digital technology for storage develop management
          strategies for refreshing medium hardware and software

            Create acidfree paper copies for transition period backup
          until we develop reliable procedures for ensuring continuing
          access to digital files

SESSION IVD

Stuart WEIBEL            The Role of SGML Markup in the CORE Project 

The emergence of highspeed telecommunications networks as a basic
feature of the scholarly workplace is driving the demand for electronic
document delivery  Three distinct categories of electronic
publishingrepublishing are necessary to support access demands in this
emerging environment

       Conversion of paper or microfilm archives to electronic format
       Conversion of electronic files to formats tailored to
          electronic retrieval and display
       Primary electronic publishing materials for which the
          electronic version is the primary format

OCLC has experimental or product development activities in each of these
areas  Among the challenges that lie ahead is the integration of these
three types of information stores in coherent distributed systems

The CORE Chemistry Online Retrieval Experiment Project is a model for
the conversion of large text and graphics collections for which
electronic typesetting files are available category   The American
Chemical Society has made available computer typography files dating from
 for its twenty journals  This collection of some  journalyears
is being converted to an electronic format that will be accessible
through several enduser applications

The use of Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML offers the means
to capture the structural richness of the original articles in a way that
will support a variety of retrieval navigation and display options
necessary to navigate effectively in very large text databases

An SGML document consists of text that is marked up with descriptive tags
that specify the function of a given element within the document  As a
formal language construct an SGML document can be parsed against a
documenttype definition DTD that unambiguously defines what elements
are allowed and where in the document they can or must occur  This
formalized map of article structure allows the user interface design to
be uncoupled from the underlying database system an important step
toward interoperability  Demonstration of this separability is a part of
the CORE project wherein user interface designs born of very different
philosophies will access the same database

A major online file of chemical journal literature complete with
graphics is being developed to test the usability of fully electronic
access to documents as a joint project of Cornell University the
American Chemical Society the Chemical Abstracts Service OCLC and
Bellcore with additional support from Sun Microsystems SpringerVerlag
DigitaI Equipment Corporation Sony Corporation of America and Apple
Computers  Our file contains the American Chemical Societys online
journals supplemented with the graphics from the paper publication  The
indexing of the articles from Chemical Abstracts Documents is available
in both image and text format and several different interfaces can be
used  Our goals are  to assess the effectiveness and acceptability of
electronic access to primary journals as compared with paper and  to
identify the most desirable functions of the user interface to an
electronic system of journals including in particular a comparison of
pageimage display with ASCII display interfaces  Early experiments with
chemistry students on a variety of tasks suggest that searching tasks are
completed much faster with any electronic system than with paper but
that for reading all versions of the articles are roughly equivalent

Pamela ANDRE and Judith ZIDAR

Text conversion is far more expensive and timeconsuming than image
capture alone  NALs experience with optical character recognition OCR
will be related and compared with the experience of having text rekeyed
What factors affect OCR accuracy?  How accurate does full text have to be
in order to be useful?  How do different users react to imperfect text?
These are questions that will be explored  For many a service bureau
may be a better solution than performing the work inhouse this will also
be discussed

Copyright law protects creative works  Protection granted by the law to
authors and disseminators of works includes the right to do or authorize
the following  reproduce the work prepare derivative works distribute
the work to the public and publicly perform or display the work  In
addition copyright owners of sound recordings and computer programs have
the right to control rental of their works  These rights are not
unlimited there are a number of exceptions and limitations

An electronic environment places strains on the copyright system
Copyright owners want to control uses of their work and be paid for any
use the public wants quick and easy access at little or no cost  The
marketplace is working in this area  Contracts guidelines on electronic
use and collective licensing are in use and being refined

Issues concerning the ability to change works without detection are more
difficult to deal with  Questions concerning the integrity of the work
and the status of the changed version under the copyright law are to be
addressed  These are public policy issues which require informed
dialogue
