    One of Africas poorest countries Mozambique has failed to exploit the
    economic potential of its sizable agricultural hydropower and

    foreign debt A sharp increase in foreign aid attracted by an economic
    reform policy has resulted in successive years of economic growth since
     Agricultural output nevertheless is at about only  of its 
    level and grain has to be imported Industry operates at only  of
    capacity The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat

Overview
    Revenues come from the export of phosphates the reserves of which are
    expected to be exhausted by the year  Phosphates have given Nauruans
    one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World   annually
    Few other resources exist so most necessities must be imported including
    fresh water from Australia The rehabilitation of mined land and the
    replacement of income from phosphates are serious longterm problems
    Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
    cushion the transition
