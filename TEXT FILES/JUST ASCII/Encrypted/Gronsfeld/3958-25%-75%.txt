Jordan Economy

Overview
    Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the late
    s and early s when its annual GNP growth averaged more than  In
    the remainder of the s however reductions in both Arab aid and worker
    remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly  per year
    Imports  mainly oil capital goods consumer durables and food  have been
    outstripping exports with the difference covered by aid remittances and
    borrowing In mid the Jordanian Government began debtrescheduling
    negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually
    reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms The
    Persian Gulf crisis that began in August  however aggravated Jordans
    already serious economic problems forcing the government to shelve the IMF
    program stop most debt payments and suspend rescheduling negotiations Aid
    from Gulf Arab states and worker remittances have plunged and refugees have
    flooded the country straining government resources Economic recovery is
    unlikely without substantial foreign aid debt relief and economic reform

Kazakhstan Economy

Overview
    The secondlargest in area of the  former Soviet republics Kazakhstan has
    vast oil coal and agricultural resources Kazakhstan is highly dependent
    on trade with Russia exchanging its natural resources for finished consumer
    and industrial goods Kazakhstan now finds itself with serious pollution
    problems backward technology and little experience in foreign markets The
    government in  pushed privatization of the economy at a faster pace than
    Russias program The ongoing transitional period  marked by sharp
    inflation in wages and prices lower output lost jobs and disruption of
    timehonored channels of supply  has brought considerable social unrest
    Kazakhstan lacks the funds technology and managerial skills for a quick
    recovery of output US firms have been enlisted to increase oil output but
    face formidable obstacles for example oil can now reach Western markets
    only through pipelines that run across independent and sometimes
    unfriendly former Soviet republics Finally the end of monolithic
    Communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open The  million
    Russians in the republic formerly the favored class now face the hostility
    of a society dominated by Muslims Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the
    formidable obstacles to the creation of a productive technologically
    advancing society
