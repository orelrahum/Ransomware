perform regression analysis for understanding cause and effect  By means
of advanced technologies computers can recognize patterns analyze text
and model concepts  Furthermore computers can complete these processes
faster with more sources and with greater precision than scholars who
must rely on manual interpretation of data  But if scholars are to use
computers for these processes source materials must be in a form
amenable to computerassisted analysis  For this reason many scholars
once they have identified the sources that are key to their research are
converting them to machinereadable form  Thus a representative example
of the numerous textual conversion projects organized by scholars around
the world in recent years to support computational text analysis is the
TLG the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae  This project is devoted to
converting the extant ancient texts of classical Greece  Editors note
according to the TLG Newsletter of May l TLG was in use in thirtytwo
different countries  This figure updates MICHELSONs previous count by one

The scholars performing these conversions have been asked to recognize
that the electronic sources they are converting for one use possess value
for other research purposes as well  As a result during the past few
years humanities scholars have initiated a number of projects to
increase scholarly access to converted text  So for example the Text
Encoding Initiative TEI about which more is said later in the program
was established as an effort by scholars to determine standard elements
and methods for encoding machinereadable text for electronic exchange
In a second effort to facilitate the sharing of converted text scholars
have created a new institution the Center for Electronic Texts in the
Humanities CETH  The center estimates that there are  series of
source texts in the humanities that have been converted to
machinereadable form worldwide  CETH is undertaking an international
search for converted text in the humanities compiling it into an
electronic library and preparing bibliographic descriptions of the
sources for the Research Libraries Information Networks RLIN
machinereadable data file  The library profession has begun to initiate
large conversion projects as well such as American Memory

While scholars have been making converted text available to one another
typically on disk or on CDROM the clear trend is toward making these
resources available through research and education networks  Thus the
American and French Research on the Treasury of the French Language
ARTFL and the Dante Project are already available on Internet
MICHELSON summarized this section on interpretation and analysis by
noting that   increasing numbers of humanities scholars in the library
community are recognizing the importance to the advancement of
scholarship of retrospective conversion of source materials in the arts
and humanities and  there is a growing realization that making the
sources available on research and education networks maximizes their
usefulness for the analysis performed by humanities scholars

The fourth process of scholarly communication is dissemination of
research findings that is publication  Scholars are using existing
research and education networks to engineer a new type of publication
scholarlycontrolled journals that are electronically produced and
disseminated  Although such journals are still emerging as a
communication format their number has grown from approximately twelve
to thirtysix during the past year July  to June   Most of
these electronic scholarly journals are devoted to topics in the
humanities  As with network conferences scholarly enthusiasm for these
electronic journals stems from the mediums unique ability to advance
scholarship in a way that no other medium can do by supporting global
feedback and interchange practically in real time early in the research
process  Beyond scholarly journals MICHELSON remarked the delivery of
commercial fulltext products such as articles in professional journals
newsletters magazines wire services and reference sources  These are
being delivered via online local library catalogues especially through
CDROMs  Furthermore according to MICHELSON there is general optimism
that the copyright and fees issues impeding the delivery of full text on
existing research and education networks soon will be resolved

The final process of scholarly communication is curriculum development
and instruction and this involves the use of computer information
technologies in two areas  The first is the development of
computeroriented instructional tools which includes simulations
multimedia applications and computer tools that are used to assist in
the analysis of sources in the classroom etc  The Perseus Project a
database that provides a multimedia curriculum on classical Greek
civilization is a good example of the way in which entire curricula are
being recast using information technologies  It is anticipated that the
current difficulty in exchanging electronically computerbased
instructional software which in turn makes it difficult for one scholar
to build upon the work of others will be resolved before too long
Standalone curricular applications that involve electronic text will be
sharable through networks reinforcing their significance as intellectual
products as well as instructional tools

The second aspect of electronic learning involves the use of research and
education networks for distance education programs  Such programs
interactively link teachers with students in geographically scattered
locations and rely on the availability of electronic instructional
resources  Distance education programs are gaining wide appeal among
state departments of education because of their demonstrated capacity to
bring advanced specialized course work and an array of experts to many
classrooms  A recent report found that at least  states operated at
least one statewide network for education in  with networks under
development in many of the remaining states

MICHELSON summarized this section by noting two striking changes taking
place in scholarly communication among humanities scholars  First is the
extent to which electronic text in particular and electronic resources
in general are being infused into each of the five processes described
above  As mentioned earlier there is a certain synergy at work here
The use of electronic resources for one process tends to stimulate its
use for other processes because the chief course of movement is toward a
comprehensive online working context for humanities scholars that
includes online availability of key bibliographies scholarly feedback
sources analytical tools and publications  MICHELSON noted further
that the movement toward a comprehensive online working context for
humanities scholars is not new  In fact it has been underway for more
than forty years in the humanities since Father Roberto Busa began
developing an electronic concordance of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas
in   What we are witnessing today MICHELSON contended is not the
beginning of this online transition but for at least some humanities
scholars the turning point in the transition from a print to an
electronic working context  Coinciding with the online transition the
second striking change is the extent to which research and education
networks are becoming the new medium of scholarly communication  The
existing Internet and the pending National Education and Research Network
NREN represent the new meeting ground where scholars are going for
bibliographic information scholarly dialogue and feedback the most
current publications in their field and highlevel educational
offerings  Traditional scholarly practices are undergoing tremendous
transformations as a result of the emergence and growing prominence of
what is called networkmediated scholarship

MICHELSON next turned to the second element of the framework she proposed
at the outset of her talk for evaluating the prospects for electronic
text namely the key information technology trends affecting the conduct
of scholarly communication over the next decade   enduser computing
and  connectivity

Enduser computing means that the person touching the keyboard or
performing computations is the same as the person who initiates or
consumes the computation  The emergence of personal computers along
with a host of other forces such as ubiquitous computing advances in
interface design and the online transition is prompting the consumers
of computation to do their own computing and is thus rendering obsolete
the traditional distinction between end users and ultimate users

The trend toward enduser computing is significant to consideration of
the prospects for electronic texts because it means that researchers are
becoming more adept at doing their own computations and thus more
competent in the use of electronic media  By avoiding programmer
intermediaries computation is becoming central to the researchers
thought process  This direct involvement in computing is changing the
researchers perspective on the nature of research itself that is the
kinds of questions that can be posed the analytical methodologies that
can be used the types and amount of sources that are appropriate for
analyses and the form in which findings are presented  The trend toward
enduser computing means that increasingly electronic media and
computation are being infused into all processes of humanities
scholarship inspiring remarkable transformations in scholarly
communication

The trend toward greater connectivity suggests that researchers are using
computation increasingly in network environments  Connectivity is
important to scholarship because it erases the distance that separates
students from teachers and scholars from their colleagues while allowing
users to access remote databases share information in many different
media connect to their working context wherever they are and
collaborate in all phases of research

The combination of the trend toward enduser computing and the trend
toward connectivity suggests that the scholarly use of electronic
resources already evident among some researchers will soon become an
established feature of scholarship  The effects of these trends along
with ongoing changes in scholarly practices point to a future in which
humanities researchers will use computation and electronic communication
to help them formulate ideas access sources perform research
collaborate with colleagues seek peer review publish and disseminate
results and engage in many other professional and educational activities

In summary MICHELSON emphasized four points   A portion of humanities
scholars already consider electronic texts the preferred format for
analysis and dissemination   Scholars are using these electronic
texts in conjunction with other electronic resources in all the
processes of scholarly communication   The humanities scholars
working context is in the process of changing from print technology to
electronic technology in many ways mirroring transformations that have
occurred or are occurring within the scientific community   These
changes are occurring in conjunction with the development of a new
communication medium  research and education networks that are
characterized by their capacity to advance scholarship in a wholly unique
way

MICHELSON also reiterated her three principal arguments  l Electronic
texts are best understood in terms of the relationship to other
electronic resources and the growing prominence of networkmediated
scholarship   The prospects for electronic texts lie in their capacity
to be integrated into the online network of electronic resources that
comprise the new working context for scholars   Retrospective conversion
of portions of the scholarly record should be a key strategy as information
providers respond to changes in scholarly communication practices
