Nicaragua Economy

Overview
    Government control of the economy historically has been extensive although
    the CHAMORRO government has pledged to greatly reduce intervention Four
    private banks have been licensed and the government has liberalized foreign
    trade and abolished price controls on most goods Over  of the
    agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned Sandinista economic
    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis The foundation
    of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities
    largely coffee and cotton Farm proMCHBKOW NIOQ FF AWZOJLH  QR  DSH
