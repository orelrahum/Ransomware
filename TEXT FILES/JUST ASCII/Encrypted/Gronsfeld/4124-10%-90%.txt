Turkey Economy

Overview
    The impressive stream of benefits from the economic reforms that Turkey
    launched in  have begun to peter out Although real growth in per capita
    GDP averaged  annually between  and  recent economic performance
    has fallen substantially Moreover inflation and interest rates remain
    high and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a
    country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally controlled
    to a free market economy Agriculture remains an important economic sector
    employing about half of the work force accounting for  of GDP and
    contributing  to exports The government has launched a
    multibilliondollar development program in the southeastern region which
    includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to
    generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland The planned
    tapping of huge additional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious
    concern in the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq The Turkish
    economy emerged from the Gulf War of early  in stronger shape than
    Ankara had expected Although the negative effects of the crisis were felt
    primarily in the politically sensitive southeast aid pledges by the
    coalition allies of more than  billion have helped offset the burden

Turkmenistan Economy

Overview
    Like the other  former Soviet republics Turkmenistan faces enormous
    problems of economic adjustment  to move away from Moscowbased central
    planning toward a system of decisionmaking by private enterpreneurs local
    government authorities and hopefully foreign investors This process
    requires wholesale changes in supply sources markets property rights and
    monetary arrangements Industry  with  of the labor force  is heavily
    weighted toward the energy sector which produced  of the exUSSRs gas
    and  of its oil Turkmenistan ranked second among the former Soviet
    republics in cotton production mainly in the irrigated western region
    where the huge Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya
