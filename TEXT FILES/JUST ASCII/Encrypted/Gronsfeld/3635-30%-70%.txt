Firm land imbosomd without firmament
Uncertain which in ocean or in air
Him God beholding from his prospect high
Wherein past present future he beholds
Thus to his only Son foreseeing spake
Only begotten Son seest thou what rage
Transports our Adversary?  whom no bounds
Prescribd no bars of Hell nor all the chains
Heapd on him there nor yet the main abyss
Wide interrupt can hold so bent he seems
On desperate revenge that shall redound
Upon his own rebellious head  And now
Through all restraint broke loose he wings his way
Not far off Heaven in the precincts of light
Directly towards the new created world
And man there placd with purpose to assay
If him by force he can destroy or worse
By some false guile pervert and shall pervert
For man will hearken to his glozing lies
And easily transgress the sole command
Sole pledge of his obedience  So will fall
He and his faithless progeny  Whose fault?
Whose but his own?  ingrate he had of me
All he could have I made him just and right
Sufficient to have stood though free to fall
Such I created all the ethereal Powers
And Spirits both them who stood and them who faild
Freely they stood who stood and fell who fell
Not free what proof could they have given sincere
Of true allegiance constant faith or love
Where only what they needs must do appeard
Not what they would?  what praise could they receive?
What pleasure I from such obedience paid
When will and reason reason also is choice
Useless and vain of freedom both despoild
Made passive both had servd necessity
Not me?  they therefore as to right belong d
So were created nor can justly accuse
Their Maker or their making or their fate
As if predestination overruld
Their will disposd by absolute decree
Or high foreknowledge they themselves decreed
Their own revolt not I if I foreknew
Foreknowledge had no influence on their fault
Which had no less proved certain unforeknown
So without least impulse or shadow of fate
Or aught by me immutably foreseen
They trespass authors to themselves in all
Both what they judge and what they choose for so
I formd them free and free they must remain
Till they enthrall themselves I else must change
Their nature and revoke the high decree
Unchangeable eternal which ordaind
THeir freedom they themselves ordaind their fall
The first sort by their own suggestion fell
Selftempted selfdepravd  Man falls deceivd
By the other first  Man therefore shall find grace
The other none  In mercy and justice both
Through Heaven and Earth so shall my glory excel
But Mercy first and last shall brightest shine
Thus while God spake ambrosial fragrance filld
All Heaven and in the blessed Spirits elect
Sense of new joy ineffable diffusd
Beyond compare the Son of God was seen
Most glorious in him all his Father shone
Substantially expressd and in his face
Divine compassion visibly appeard
Love without end and without measure grace
Which uttering thus he to his Father spake
O Father gracious was that word which closd
Thy sovran command that Man should find grace
 that Man should find grace
For which both Heaven and earth shall high extol
Thy praises with the innumerable sound
Of hymns and sacred songs wherewith thy throne
Encompassd shall resound thee ever blest
For should Man finally be lost should Man
Thy creature late so lovd thy youngest son
Fall circumvented thus by fraud though joind
With his own folly?  that be from thee far
That far be from thee Father who art judge
Of all things made and judgest only right
Or shall the Adversary thus obtain
His end and frustrate thine?  shall he fulfill
His malice and thy goodness bring to nought
Or proud return though to his heavier doom
Yet with revenge accomplishd and to Hell
Draw after him the whole race of mankind
By him corrupted?  or wilt thou thyself
Abolish thy creation and unmake
For him what for thy glory thou hast made?
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both
Be questiond and blasphemd without defence
To whom the great Creator thus replied
O son in whom my soul hath chief delight
Son of my bosom Son who art alone
My word my wisdom and effectual might
All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are all
As my eternal purpose hath decreed
Man shall not quite be lost but savd who will
Yet not of will in him but grace in me
Freely vouchsafd once more I will renew
His lapsed powers though forfeit and enthralld
By sin to foul exorbitant desires
Upheld by me yet once more he shall stand
On even ground against his mortal foe
By me upheld that he may know how frail
His fallen condition is and to me owe
All his deliverance and to none but me
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace
Elect above the rest so is my will
The rest shall hear me call and oft be warnd
Their sinful state and to appease betimes
The incensed Deity while offerd grace
Invites for I will clear their senses dark
What may suffice and soften stony hearts
To pray repent and bring obedience due
To prayer repentance and obedience due
Though but endeavourd with sincere intent
Mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut
And I will place within them as a guide
My umpire Conscience whom if they will hear
Light after light well usd they shall attain
And to the end persisting safe arrive
This my long sufferance and my day of grace
They who neglect and scorn shall never taste
But hard be hardend blind be blinded more
That they may stumble on and deeper fall
And none but such from mercy I exclude
But yet all is not done Man disobeying
Disloyal breaks his fealty and sins
Against the high supremacy of Heaven
Affecting Godhead and so losing all
To expiate his treason hath nought left
But to destruction sacred and devote
He with his whole posterity must die
Die he or justice must unless for him
Some other able and as willing pay
The rigid satisfaction death for death
Say heavenly Powers where shall we find such love?
Which of you will be mortal to redeem
Mans mortal crime and just the unjust to save?
Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?
And silence was in Heaven  on Mans behalf
He askd but all the heavenly quire stood mute
Patron or intercessour none appeard
Much less that durst upon his own head draw
The deadly forfeiture and ransom set
And now without redemption all mankind
Must have been lost adjudgd to Death and Hell
By doom severe had not the Son of God
In whom the fulness dwells of love divine
His dearest mediation thus renewd
Father thy word is past Man shall find grace
And shall grace not find means that finds her way
The speediest of thy winged messengers
To visit all thy creatures and to all
Comes unprevented unimplord unsought?
Happy for Man so coming he her aid
Can never seek once dead in sins and lost
Atonement for himself or offering meet
Indebted and undone hath none to bring
Behold me then  me for him life for life
I offer on me let thine anger fall
Account me Man I for his sake will leave
 Thy bosom and this glory next to thee
 Freely put off and for him lastly die
 Well pleased on me let Death wreak all his rage
 Under his gloomy power I shall not long
 Lie vanquished Thou hast given me to possess
 Life in myself for ever by thee I live
 Though now to Death I yield and am his due
 All that of me can die yet that debt paid
  thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave
 His prey nor suffer my unspotted soul
 For ever with corruption there to dwell
 But I shall rise victorious and subdue
 My vanquisher spoiled of his vaunted spoil
 Death his deaths wound shall then receive and stoop
 Inglorious of his mortal sting disarmed
 I through the ample air in triumph high
 Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell and show
The powers of darkness bound Thou at the sight
 Pleased out of Heaven shalt look down and smile
 While by thee raised I ruin all my foes
 Death last and with his carcase glut the grave
 Then with the multitude of my redeemed
 Shall enter Heaven long absent and return
 Father to see thy face wherein no cloud
 Of anger shall remain but peace assured
 And reconcilement wrath shall be no more
 Thenceforth but in thy presence joy entire
 His words here ended but his meek aspect
 Silent yet spake and breathed immortal love
 To mortal men above which only shone
 Filial obedience as a sacrifice
 Glad to be offered he attends the will
 Of his great Father Admiration seized
 All Heaven what this might mean and whither tend
 Wondering but soon th Almighty thus replied
 O thou in Heaven and Earth the only peace
 Found out for mankind under wrath O thou
 My sole complacence Well thou knowst how dear
 To me are all my works nor Man the least
 Though last created that for him I spare
 Thee from my bosom and right hand to save
 By losing thee a while the whole race lost

     
 Thou therefore whom thou only canst redeem
 Their nature also to thy nature join
 And be thyself Man among men on Earth
 Made flesh when time shall be of virgin seed
 By wondrous birth be thou in Adams room
The head of all mankind though Adams son
As in him perish all men so in thee
As from a second root shall be restored
As many as are restored without thee none
His crime makes guilty all his sons thy merit
Imputed shall absolve them who renounce
Their own both righteous and unrighteous deeds
And live in thee transplanted and from thee
Receive new life  So Man as is most just
Shall satisfy for Man be judged and die
And dying rise and rising with him raise
His brethren ransomed with his own dear life
So heavenly love shall outdo hellish hate
Giving to death and dying to redeem
So dearly to redeem what hellish hate
So easily destroyed and still destroys
In those who when they may accept not grace
Nor shalt thou by descending to assume
Mans nature lessen or degrade thine own
Because thou hast though throned in highest bliss
Equal to God and equally enjoying
Godlike fruition quitted all to save
A world from utter loss and hast been found
By merit more than birthright Son of God
Found worthiest to be so by being good
Far more than great or high because in thee
Love hath abounded more than glory abounds
Therefore thy humiliation shall exalt
With thee thy manhood also to this throne
Here shalt thou sit incarnate here shalt reign
Both God and Man Son both of God and Man
Anointed universal King all power
I give thee reign for ever and assume
Thy merits under thee as head supreme
Thrones Princedoms Powers Dominions I reduce
All knees to thee shall bow of them that bide
In Heaven or Earth or under Earth in Hell
When thou attended gloriously from Heaven
Shalt in the sky appear and from thee send
The summoning ArchAngels to proclaim
Thy dread tribunal forthwith from all winds
The living and forthwith the cited dead
Of all past ages to the general doom
Shall hasten such a peal shall rouse their sleep
Then all thy saints assembled thou shalt judge
Bad Men and Angels they arraigned shall sink
Beneath thy sentence Hell her numbers full
Thenceforth shall be for ever shut  Mean while
The world shall burn and from her ashes spring
New Heaven and Earth wherein the just shall dwell
And after all their tribulations long
See golden days fruitful of golden deeds
With joy and peace triumphing and fair truth
Then thou thy regal scepter shalt lay by
For regal scepter then no more shall need
God shall be all in all  But all ye Gods
Adore him who to compass all this dies
Adore the Son and honour him as me
No sooner had the Almighty ceased but all
The multitude of Angels with a shout
Loud as from numbers without number sweet
As from blest voices uttering joy Heaven rung
With jubilee and loud Hosannas filled
The eternal regions  Lowly reverent
Towards either throne they bow and to the ground
With solemn adoration down they cast
Their crowns inwove with amarant and gold
Immortal amarant a flower which once
In Paradise fast by the tree of life
Began to bloom but soon for mans offence
To Heaven removed where first it grew there grows
And flowers aloft shading the fount of life
And where the river of bliss through midst of Heaven
Rolls oer Elysian flowers her amber stream
With these that never fade the Spirits elect
Bind their resplendent locks inwreathed with beams
Now in loose garlands thick thrown off the bright
Pavement that like a sea of jasper shone
Impurpled with celestial roses smiled
Then crowned again their golden harps they took
Harps ever tuned that glittering by their side
Like quivers hung and with preamble sweet
Of charming symphony they introduce
Their sacred song and waken raptures high
No voice exempt no voice but well could join
Melodious part such concord is in Heaven
Thee Father first they sung Omnipotent
Immutable Immortal Infinite
Eternal King the Author of all being
Fonntain of light thyself invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitst
Throned inaccessible but when thou shadest
The full blaze of thy beams and through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear
Yet dazzle Heaven that brightest Seraphim
Approach not but with both wings veil their eyes
Thee next they sang of all creation first
Begotten Son Divine Similitude
In whose conspicuous countenance without cloud
Made visible the Almighty Father shines
Whom else no creature can behold on thee
Impressed the effulgence of his glory abides
Transfused on thee his ample Spirit rests
He Heaven of Heavens and all the Powers therein
By thee created and by thee threw down
The aspiring Dominations  Thou that day
Thy Fathers dreadful thunder didst not spare
Nor stop thy flaming chariotwheels that shook
Heavens everlasting frame while oer the necks
Thou drovest of warring Angels disarrayed
Back from pursuit thy Powers with loud acclaim
Thee only extolled Son of thy Fathers might
To execute fierce vengeance on his foes
Not so on Man  Him through their malice fallen
Father of mercy and grace thou didst not doom
So strictly but much more to pity incline
No sooner did thy dear and only Son
Perceive thee purposed not to doom frail Man
So strictly but much more to pity inclined
He to appease thy wrath and end the strife
Of mercy and justice in thy face discerned
Regardless of the bliss wherein he sat
Second to thee offered himself to die
For Mans offence  O unexampled love
Love no where to be found less than Divine
Hail Son of God Saviour of Men  Thy name
Shall be the copious matter of my song
Henceforth and never shall my heart thy RRJQWH
