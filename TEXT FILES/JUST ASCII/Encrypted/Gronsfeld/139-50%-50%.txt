	That from the hunters aim had taen a hurt
	Did come to languish and indeed my lord
	The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
	That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
	Almost to bursting and the big round tears
	Coursed one another down his innocent nose
	In piteous chase and thus the hairy fool
	Much marked of the melancholy Jaques
	Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook
	Augmenting it with tears

DUKE SENIOR	But what said Jaques?
	Did he not moralize this spectacle?

First Lord	O yes into a thousand similes
	First for his weeping into the needless stream
	Poor deer quoth he thou makest a testament
	As worldlings do giving thy sum of more
	To that which had too much then being there alone
	Left and abandond of his velvet friends
	Tis right quoth he thus misery doth part
	The flux of company anon a careless herd
	Full of the pasture jumps along by him
	And never stays to greet him Ay quoth Jaques
	Sweep on you fat and greasy citizens
	Tis just the fashion wherefore do you look
	Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?
	Thus most invectively he pierceth through
	The body of the country city court
	Yea and of this our life swearing that we
	Are mere usurpers tyrants and whats worse
	To fright the animals and to kill them up
	In their assignd and native dwellingplace

DUKE SENIOR	And did you leave him in this contemplation?

Second Lord	We did my lord weeping and commenting
	Upon the sobbing deer

DUKE SENIOR	Show me the place
	I love to cope him in these sullen fits
	For then hes full of matter

First Lord	Ill bring you to him straight

	Exeunt

SCENE II	A room in the palace


	Enter DUKE FREDERICK with Lords

DUKE FREDERICK	Can it be possible that no man saw them?
	It cannot be some villains of my court
	Are of consent and sufferance in this

First Lord	I cannot hear of any that did see her
	The ladies her attendants of her chamber
	Saw her abed and in the morning early
	They found the bed untreasured of their mistress

Second Lord	My lord the roynish clown at whom so oft
	Your grace was wont to laugh is also missing
	Hisperia the princess gentlewoman
	Confesses that she secretly oerheard
	Your daughter and her cousin much commend
	The parts and graces of the wrestler
	That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles
	And she believes wherever they are gone
	That youth is surely in their company

DUKE FREDERICK	Send to his brother fetch that gallant hither
	If he be absent bring his brother to me
	Ill make him find him do this suddenly
	And let not search and inquisition quail
	To bring again these foolish runaways

SCENE III	Before OLIVERS house


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM meeting

ORLANDO	Whos there?

ADAM	What my young master? O my gentle master
	O my sweet master O you memory
	Of old Sir Rowland why what make you here?
	Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
	And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant?
	Why would you be so fond to overcome
	The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
	Your praise is come too swiftly home before you
	Know you not master to some kind of men
	Their graces serve them but as enemies?
	No more do yours your virtues gentle master
	Are sanctified and holy traitors to you
	O what a world is this when what is comely
	Envenoms him that bears it

ORLANDO	Why whats the matter?

ADAM	O unhappy youth
	Come not within these doors within this roof
	The enemy of all your graces lives
	Your brotherno no brother yet the son
	Yet not the son I will not call him son
	Of him I was about to call his father
	Hath heard your praises and this night he means
	To burn the lodging where you use to lie
	And you within it if he fail of that
	He will have other means to cut you off
	I overheard him and his practises
	This is no place this house is but a butchery
	Abhor it fear it do not enter it

ORLANDO	Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go?

ADAM	No matter whither so you come not here

ORLANDO	What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
	Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
	A thievish living on the common road?
	This I must do or know not what to do
	Yet this I will not do do how I can
	I rather will subject me to the malice
	Of a diverted blood and bloody brother

ADAM	But do not so I have five hundred crowns
	The thrifty hire I saved under your father
	Which I did store to be my fosternurse
	When service should in my old limbs lie lame
	And unregarded age in corners thrown
	Take that and He that doth the ravens feed
	Yea providently caters for the sparrow
	Be comfort to my age Here is the gold
	And all this I give you Let me be your servant
	Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty
	For in my youth I never did apply
	Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
	Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
	The means of weakness and debility
	Therefore my age is as a lusty winter
	Frosty but kindly let me go with you
	Ill do the service of a younger man
	In all your business and necessities

ORLANDO	O good old man how well in thee appears
	The constant service of the antique world
	When service sweat for duty not for meed
	Thou art not for the fashion of these times
	Where none will sweat but for promotion
	And having that do choke their service up
	Even with the having it is not so with thee
	But poor old man thou prunest a rotten tree
	That cannot so much as a blossom yield
	In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
	But come thy ways well go along together
	And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
	Well light upon some settled low content

ADAM	Master go on and I will follow thee
	To the last gasp with truth and loyalty
	From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
	Here lived I but now live here no more
	At seventeen years many their fortunes seek
	But at fourscore it is too late a week
	Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
	Than to die well and not my masters debtor

SCENE IV	The Forest of Arden


	Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede CELIA for Aliena
	and TOUCHSTONE

ROSALIND	O Jupiter how weary are my spirits

TOUCHSTONE	I care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary

ROSALIND	I could find in my heart to disgrace my mans
	apparel and to cry like a woman but I must comfort
	the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show
	itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage
	good Aliena

CELIA	I pray you bear with me I cannot go no further

TOUCHSTONE	For my part I had rather bear with you than bear
	you yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you
	for I think you have no money in your purse

ROSALIND	Well this is the forest of Arden

TOUCHSTONE	Ay now am I in Arden the more fool I when I was
	at home I was in a better place but travellers
	must be content

ROSALIND	Ay be so good Touchstone

	Enter CORIN and SILVIUS

	Look you who comes here a young man and an old in
	solemn talk

CORIN	That is the way to make her scorn you still

SILVIUS	O Corin that thou knewst how I do love her

CORIN	I partly guess for I have loved ere now

SILVIUS	No Corin being old thou canst not guess
	Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
	As ever sighd upon a midnight pillow
	But if thy love were ever like to mine
	As sure I think did never man love so
	How many actions most ridiculous
	Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?

CORIN	Into a thousand that I have forgotten

SILVIUS	O thou didst then neer love so heartily
	If thou rememberst not the slightest folly
	That ever love did make thee run into
	Thou hast not loved
	Or if thou hast not sat as I do now
	Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress praise
	Thou hast not loved
	Or if thou hast not broke from company
	Abruptly as my passion now makes me
	Thou hast not loved
	O Phebe Phebe Phebe

	Exit

ROSALIND	Alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
	I have by hard adventure found mine own

TOUCHSTONE	And I mine I remember when I was in love I broke
	my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
	coming anight to Jane Smile and I remember the
	kissing of her batlet and the cows dugs that her
	pretty chopt hands had milked and I remember the
	wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom I took
	two cods and giving her them again said with
	weeping tears Wear these for my sake We that are
	true lovers run into strange capers but as all is
	mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly

ROSALIND	Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of

TOUCHSTONE	Nay I shall neer be ware of mine own wit till I
	break my shins against it

ROSALIND	Jove Jove this shepherds passion
	Is much upon my fashion

TOUCHSTONE	And mine but it grows something stale with me

CELIA	I pray you one of you question yond man
	If he for gold will give us any food
	I faint almost to death

TOUCHSTONE	Holla you clown

ROSALIND	Peace fool hes not thy kinsman

CORIN	Who calls?

TOUCHSTONE	Your betters sir

CORIN	                  Else are they very wretched

ROSALIND	Peace I say Good even to you friend

CORIN	And to you gentle sir and to you all

ROSALIND	I prithee shepherd if that love or gold
	Can in this desert place buy entertainment
	Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
	Heres a young maid with travel much oppressd
	And faints for succor

CORIN	Fair sir I pity her
	And wish for her sake more than for mine own
	My fortunes were more able to relieve her
	But I am shepherd to another man
	And do not shear the fleeces that I graze
	My master is of churlish disposition
	And little recks to find the way to heaven
	By doing deeds of hospitality
	Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
	Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
	By reason of his absence there is nothing
	That you will feed on but what is come see
	And in my voice most welcome shall you be

ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

CORIN	That young swain that you saw here but erewhile
	That little cares for buying any thing

ROSALIND	I pray thee if it stand with honesty
	Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
	And thou shalt have to pay for it of us

CELIA	And we will mend thy wages I like this place
	And willingly could waste my time in it

CORIN	Assuredly the thing is to be sold
	Go with me if you like upon report
	The soil the profit and this kind of life
	I will your very faithful feeder be
	And buy it with your gold right suddenly
