      This sort of system is overcoming the isolation between disciplines
     that often exists in schools  For example many English teachers are
     requiring their students to write papers on historical topics
     represented in AM  Numerous teachers have reported that their
     students are learning critical thinking skills using the system

      On a broader level AM is introducing primary materials not only
     to students but also to teachers in an environment where often
     simply none existan exciting thing for the students because it
     helps them learn to conduct research to interpret and to draw
     their own conclusions  In learning to conduct research and what it
     means students are motivated to seek knowledge  That relates to
     another positive outcomea high level of personal involvement of
     students with the materials in this system and greater motivation to
     conduct their own research and draw their own conclusions

      Perhaps the most ironic strength of these kinds of archival
     electronic resources is that many of the teachers AM interviewed
     were desperate it is no exaggeration to say not only for primary
     materials but for unstructured primary materials  These would they
     thought foster personally motivated research exploration and
     excitement in their students  Indeed these materials have done
     just that  Ironically however this lack of structure produces
     some of the confusion to which the newness of these kinds of
     resources may also contribute  The key to effective use of archival
     products in a school environment is a clear effective introduction
     to the system and to what it contains

                                 


DISCUSSION  Nothing known quantitatively about the number of
humanities scholars who must see the original versus those who would
settle for an edited transcript or about the ways in which humanities
scholars are using information technology  Firm conclusions concerning
the manner and extent of the use of supporting materials in print
provided by AM to await completion of evaluative study  A listeners
reflections on additional applications of electronic texts  Role of
electronic resources in teaching elementary research skills to students 


During the discussion that followed the presentations by MICHELSON
VECCIA and FREEMAN additional points emerged

LESK asked if MICHELSON could give any quantitative estimate of the
number of humanities scholars who must see or want to see the original
or the best possible version of the material versus those who typically
would settle for an edited transcript  While unable to provide a figure
she offered her impressions as an archivist who has done some reference
work and has discussed this issue with other archivists who perform
reference that those who use archives and those who use primary sources
for what would be considered very highlevel scholarly research as
opposed to say undergraduate papers were few in number especially
given the public interest in using primary sources to conduct
genealogical or avocational research and the kind of professional
research done by people in private industry or the federal government
More important in MICHELSONs view was that quantitatively nothing is
known about the ways in which for example humanities scholars are using
information technology  No studies exist to offer guidance in creating
strategies  The most recent study was conducted in  by the American
Council of Learned Societies ACLS and what it showed was that 
percent of humanities scholars at that time were using computers  That
constitutes the extent of our knowledge

Concerning AMs strategy for orienting people toward the scope of
electronic resources FREEMAN could offer no hard conclusions at this
point because she and her colleagues were still waiting to see
particularly in the schools what has been made of their efforts  Within
the system however AM has provided what are called electronic exhibits
such as introductions to time periods and materialsand these are
intended to offer a student user a sense of what a broadside is  and what
it might tell her or him  But FREEMAN conceded that the project staff
would have to talk with students next year after teachers have had a
summer to use the materials and attempt to discover what the students
were learning from the materials  In addition FREEMAN described
supporting materials in print provided by AM at the request of local
teachers during a meeting held at LC  These included time lines
bibliographies and other materials that could be reproduced on a
photocopier in a classroom  Teachers could walk away with and use these
and in this way gain a better understanding of the contents  But again
reaching firm conclusions concerning the manner and extent of their use
would have to wait until next year

As to the changes she saw occurring at the National Archives and Records
Administration NARA as a result of the increasing emphasis on
technology in scholarly research MICHELSON stated that NARA at this
point was absorbing the report by her and Jeff Rothenberg addressing
strategies for the archival profession in general although not for the
National Archives specifically  NARA is just beginning to establish its
role and what it can do  In terms of changes and initiatives that NARA
can take no clear response could be given at this time

GREENFIELD remarked two trends mentioned in the session  Reflecting on
DALYs opening comments on how he could have used a Latin collection of
text in an electronic form he said that at first he thought most scholars
would be unwilling to do that  But as he thought of that in terms of the
original meaning of researchthat is having already mastered these texts
researching them for critical and comparative purposesfor the first time
the electronic format made a lot of sense  GREENFIELD could envision
growing numbers of scholars learning the new technologies for that very
aspect of their scholarship and for conveniences sake

Listening to VECCIA and FREEMAN GREENFIELD thought of an additional
application of electronic texts  He realized that AM could be used as a
guide to lead someone to original sources  Students cannot be expected
to have mastered these sources things they have never known about
before  Thus AM is leading them in theory to a vast body of
information and giving them a superficial overview of it enabling them
to select parts of it  GREENFIELD asked if any evidence exists that this
resource will indeed teach the new user the K students how to do
research  Scholars already know how to do research and are applying
these new tools  But he wondered why students would go beyond picking
out things that were most exciting to them

FREEMAN conceded the correctness of GREENFIELDs observation as applied
to a school environment  The risk is that a student would sit down at a
system play with it find some things of interest and then walk away
But in the relatively controlled situation of a school library much will
depend on the instructions a teacher or a librarian gives a student  She
viewed the situation not as one of finetuning research skills but of
involving students at a personal level in understanding and researching
things  Given the guidance one can receive at school it then becomes
possible to teach elementary research skills to students which in fact
one particular librarian said she was teaching her fifth graders
FREEMAN concluded that introducing the idea of following ones own path
of inquiry which is essentially what research entails involves more
than teaching specific skills  To these comments VECCIA added the
observation that the individual teacher and the use of a creative
resource rather than AM itself seemed to make the key difference
Some schools and some teachers are making excellent use of the nature
of critical thinking and teaching skills she said

Concurring with these remarks DALY closed the session with the thought that
the more that producers produced for teachers and for scholars to use with
their students the more successful their electronic products would prove

                                 

SESSION II  SHOW AND TELL

Jacqueline HESS director National Demonstration Laboratory served as
moderator of the "showandtell" session  She noted that a
questionandanswer period would follow each presentation


MYLONAS  Overview and content of Perseus  Perseus primary materials
exist in a systemindependent archival form  A concession  Textual
aspects of Perseus  Tools to use with the Greek text  Prepared indices
and fulltext searches in Perseus  EnglishGreek word search leads to
close study of words and concepts  Navigating Perseus by tracing down
indices  Using the iconography to perform research 


Elli MYLONAS managing editor Perseus Project Harvard University first
gave an overview of Perseus a large collaborative effort based at
Harvard University but with contributors and collaborators located at
numerous universities and colleges in the United States eg Bowdoin
Maryland Pomona Chicago Virginia  Funded primarily by the
AnnenbergCPB Project with additional funding from Apple Harvard and
the Packard Humanities Institute among others Perseus is a multimedia
hypertextual database for teaching and research on classical Greek
civilization which was released in February  in version  and
distributed by Yale University Press

Consisting entirely of primary materials Perseus includes ancient Greek
texts and translations of those texts catalog entriesthat is museum
catalog entries not library catalog entrieson vases sites coins
sculpture and archaeological objects maps and a dictionary among
other sources  The number of objects and the objects for which catalog
entries exist are accompanied by thousands of color images which
constitute a major feature of the database  Perseus contains
approximately  megabytes of text an amount that will double in
subsequent versions  In addition to these primary materials the Perseus
Project has been building tools for using them making access and
navigation easier the goal being to build part of the electronic
environment discussed earlier in the morning in which students or
scholars can work with their sources

The demonstration of Perseus will show QNUG E IWEJCQTV QF CPI UJES FWWS
