Cook Islands Economy

Overview
    Agriculture provides the economic base The major export earners are fruit
    copra and clothing Manufacturing activities are limited to a
    fruitprocessing plant and several clothing factories Economic development
    is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack
    of natural resources and good transportation links A large trade deficit is
    annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid
    Current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
    and expanding the fishing industry
