Lithuania Economy

Overview
    Lithuania is striving to become a small independent largely privatized
    economy rather than a segment of a huge centrally planned economy Although
    substantially above average in living standards and technology in the old
    USSR Lithuania historically lagged behind Latvia and Estonia in economic
    development It is ahead of its Baltic neighbors however in implementing
    market reform The country has no important natural resources aside from its
    arable land and strategic location Industry depends entirely on imported
    materials that have come from the republics of the former USSR Lithuania
    benefits from its icefree port at Klaipeda on the Baltic Sea and its rail
    and highway hub at Vilnius which provides land communication between
    Eastern Europe and Russia Latvia Estonia and Belarus Industry produces a
    small assortment of highquality products ranging from complex machine
    tools to sophisticated consumer electronics Thanks to nuclear power
    Lithuania is presently selfsufficient in electricity exporting its surplus
    to Latvia and Belarus the nuclear facilities inherited from the USSR
    however have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in safety
    standards Agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former Soviet
    Union Lithuania holds first place in per capita consumption of meat second
    place for eggs and potatoes and fourth place for milk and dairy products
    Grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries As to
    economic reforms Lithuania is pressing ahead with plans to privatize at
    least  of stateowned property industry agriculture and housing
    having already sold many small enterprises using a voucher system Other
    government priorities include stimulating foreign investment by protecting
    the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign trade away from
    Eastern markets to the more competitive Western markets For the moment
    Lithuania will remain highly dependent on Russia for energy raw materials
    grains and markets for its products

Luxembourg Economy

Overview
    The stable economy features moderate growth low inflation and negligible
    unemployment Agriculture is based on small but highly productive
    familyowned farms The industrial sector until recently dominated by
    steel has become increasingly more diversified particularly toward
    hightechnology firms During the past decade growth in the financial
    sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel Services
    especially banking account for a growing proportion of the economy
    Luxembourg participates in an economic union with Belgium on trade and most
    financial matters and is also closely connected economically to the
    Netherlands
