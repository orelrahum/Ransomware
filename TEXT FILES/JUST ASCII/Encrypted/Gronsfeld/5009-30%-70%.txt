Thought him still speaking still stood fixed to hear
Then as new waked thus gratefully replied
What thanks sufficient or what recompence
Equal have I to render thee divine
Historian who thus largely hast allayed
The thirst I had of knowledge and vouchsafed
This friendly condescension to relate
Things else by me unsearchable now heard
With wonder but delight and as is due
With glory attributed to the high
Creator  Something yet of doubt remains
Which only thy solution can resolve
When I behold this goodly frame this world
Of Heaven and Earth consisting and compute
Their magnitudes this Earth a spot a grain
An atom with the firmament compared
And all her numbered stars that seem to roll
Spaces incomprehensible for such
Their distance argues and their swift return
Diurnal merely to officiate light
Round this opacous Earth this punctual spot
One day and night in all her vast survey
Useless besides reasoning I oft admire
How Nature wise and frugal could commit
Such disproportions with superfluous hand
So many nobler bodies to create
Greater so manifold to this one use
For aught appears and on their orbs impose
Such restless revolution day by day
Repeated while the sedentary Earth
That better might with far less compass move
Served by more noble than herself attains
Her end without least motion and receives
As tribute such a sumless journey brought
Of incorporeal speed her warmth and light
Speed to describe whose swiftness number fails
So spake our sire and by his countenance seemed
Entering on studious thoughts abstruse which Eve
Perceiving where she sat retired in sight
With lowliness majestick from her seat
And grace that won who saw to wish her stay
Rose and went forth among her fruits and flowers
To visit how they prospered bud and bloom
Her nursery they at her coming sprung
And touched by her fair tendance gladlier grew
Yet went she not as not with such discourse
Delighted or not capable her ear
Of what was high such pleasure she reserved
Adam relating she sole auditress
Her husband the relater she preferred
Before the Angel and of him to ask
Chose rather he she knew would intermix
Grateful digressions and solve high dispute
With conjugal caresses from his lip
Not words alone pleased her  O when meet now
Such pairs in love and mutual honour joined?
With Goddesslike demeanour forth she went
Not unattended for on her as Queen
A pomp of winning Graces waited still
And from about her shot darts of desire
Into all eyes to wish her still in sight
And Raphael now to Adams doubt proposed
Benevolent and facile thus replied
To ask or search I blame thee not for Heaven
Is as the book of God before thee set
Wherein to read his wonderous works and learn
His seasons hours or days or months or years
This to attain whether Heaven move or Earth
Imports not if thou reckon right the rest
From Man or Angel the great Architect
Did wisely to conceal and not divulge
His secrets to be scanned by them who ought
Rather admire or if they list to try
Conjecture he his fabrick of the Heavens
Hath left to their disputes perhaps to move
His laughter at their quaint opinions wide
Hereafter when they come to model Heaven
And calculate the stars how they will wield
The mighty frame how build unbuild contrive
To save appearances how gird the sphere
With centrick and eccentrick scribbled oer
Cycle and epicycle orb in orb
Already by thy reasoning this I guess
Who art to lead thy offspring and supposest
That bodies bright and greater should not serve
The less not bright nor Heaven such journeys run
Earth sitting still when she alone receives
The benefit  Consider first that great
Or bright infers not excellence the Earth
Though in comparison of Heaven so small
Nor glistering may of solid good contain
More plenty than the sun that barren shines
Whose virtue on itself works no effect
But in the fruitful Earth there first received
His beams unactive else their vigour find
Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries
Officious but to thee Earths habitant
And for the Heavens wide circuit let it speak
The Makers high magnificence who built
So spacious and his line stretched out so far
That Man may know he dwells not in his own
An edifice too large for him to fill
Lodged in a small partition and the rest
Ordained for uses to his Lord best known
The swiftness of those circles attribute
Though numberless to his Omnipotence
That to corporeal substances could add
Speed almost spiritual  Me thou thinkest not slow
Who since the morninghour set out from Heaven
Where God resides and ere midday arrived
In Eden distance inexpressible
By numbers that have name  But this I urge
Admitting motion in the Heavens to show
Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved
Not that I so affirm though so it seem
To thee who hast thy dwelling here on Earth
God to remove his ways from human sense
Placed Heaven from Earth so far that earthly sight
If it presume might err in things too high
And no advantage gain  What if the sun
Be center to the world and other stars
By his attractive virtue and their own
Incited dance about him various rounds?
Their wandering course now high now low then hid
Progressive retrograde or standing still
In six thou seest and what if seventh to these
The planet earth so stedfast though she seem
Insensibly three different motions move?
Which else to several spheres thou must ascribe
Moved contrary with thwart obliquities
Or save the sun his labour and that swift
Nocturnal and diurnal rhomb supposed
Invisible else above all stars the wheel
Of day and night which needs not thy belief
If earth industrious of herself fetch day
Travelling east and with her part averse
From the suns beam meet night her other part
Still luminous by his ray  What if that light
Sent from her through the wide transpicuous air
To the terrestrial moon be as a star
Enlightening her by day as she by night
This earth? reciprocal if land be there
Fields and inhabitants  Her spots thou seest
As clouds and clouds may rain and rain produce
Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat
Allotted there and other suns perhaps
With their attendant moons thou wilt descry
Communicating male and female light
Which two great sexes animate the world
Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed
By living soul desart and desolate
Only to shine yet scarce to contribute
Each orb a glimpse of light conveyed so far
Down to this habitable which returns
Light back to them is obvious to dispute
But whether thus these things or whether not
But whether the sun predominant in Heaven
Rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun
He from the east his flaming road begin
Or she from west her silent course advance
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
On her soft axle while she paces even
And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid
Leave them to God above him serve and fear
Of other creatures as him pleases best
Wherever placed let him dispose joy thou
In what he gives to thee this Paradise
And thy fair Eve Heaven is for thee too high
To know what passes there be lowly wise
Think only what concerns thee and thy being
Dream not of other worlds what creatures there
Live in what state condition or degree
Contented that thus far hath been revealed
Not of Earth only but of highest Heaven
To whom thus Adam cleared of doubt replied
How fully hast thou satisfied me pure
Intelligence of Heaven Angel serene
And freed from intricacies taught to live
The easiest way nor with perplexing thoughts
To interrupt the sweet of life from which
God hath bid dwell far off all anxious cares
And not molest us unless we ourselves
Seek them with wandering thoughts and notions vain
But apt the mind or fancy is to rove
Unchecked and of her roving is no end
Till warned or by experience taught she learn
That not to know at large of things remote
From use obscure and subtle but to know
That which before us lies in daily life
Is the prime wisdom  What is more is fume
Or emptiness or fond impertinence
And renders us in things that most concern
Unpractised unprepared and still to seek
Therefore from this high pitch let us descend
A lower flight and speak of things at hand
Useful whence haply mention may arise
Of something not unseasonable to ask
By sufferance and thy wonted favour deigned
Thee I have heard relating what was done
Ere my remembrance now hear me relate
My story which perhaps thou hast not heard
And day is not yet spent till then thou seest
How subtly to detain thee I devise
Inviting thee to hear while I relate
Fond were it not in hope of thy reply
For while I sit with thee I seem in Heaven
And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear
Than fruits of palmtree pleasantest to thirst
And hunger both from labour at the hour
Of sweet repast they satiate and soon fill
Though pleasant but thy words with grace divine
Imbued bring to their sweetness no satiety
To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek
Nor are thy lips ungraceful Sire of men
Nor tongue ineloquent for God on thee
Abundantly his gifts hath also poured
Inward and outward both his image fair
Speaking or mute all comeliness and grace
Attends thee and each word each motion forms
Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth
Than of our fellowservant and inquire
Gladly into the ways of God with Man
For God we see hath honoured thee and set
On Man his equal love  Say therefore on
For I that day was absent as befel
Bound on a voyage uncouth and obscure
Far on excursion toward the gates of Hell
Squared in full legion such command we had
To see that none thence issued forth a spy
Or enemy while God was in his work
Lest he incensed at such eruption bold
Destruction with creation might have mixed
Not that they durst without his leave attempt
But us he sends upon his high behests
For state as Sovran King and to inure
Our prompt obedience  Fast we found fast shut
The dismal gates and barricadoed strong
But long ere our approaching heard within
Noise other than the sound of dance or song
Torment and loud lament and furious rage
Glad we returned up to thG CXIWWX SM UQLPV
