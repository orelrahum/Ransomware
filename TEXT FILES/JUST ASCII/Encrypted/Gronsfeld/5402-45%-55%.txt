ACT V



SCENE IV	The forest


	Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS JAQUES ORLANDO OLIVER
	and CELIA

DUKE SENIOR	Dost thou believe Orlando that the boy
	Can do all this that he hath promised?

ORLANDO	I sometimes do believe and sometimes do not
	As those that fear they hope and know they fear

	Enter ROSALIND SILVIUS and PHEBE

ROSALIND	Patience once more whiles our compact is urged
	You say if I bring in your Rosalind
	You will bestow her on Orlando here?

DUKE SENIOR	That would I had I kingdoms to give with her

ROSALIND	And you say you will have her when I bring her?

ORLANDO	That would I were I of all kingdoms king

ROSALIND	You say youll marry me if I be willing?

PHEBE	That will I should I die the hour after

ROSALIND	But if you do refuse to marry me
	Youll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

PHEBE	So is the bargain

ROSALIND	You say that youll have Phebe if she will?

SILVIUS	Though to have her and death were both one thing

ROSALIND	I have promised to make all this matter even
	Keep you your word O duke to give your daughter
	You yours Orlando to receive his daughter
	Keep your word Phebe that youll marry me
	Or else refusing me to wed this shepherd
	Keep your word Silvius that youll marry her
	If she refuse me and from hence I go
	To make these doubts all even

	Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA

DUKE SENIOR	I do remember in this shepherd boy
	Some lively touches of my daughters favour

ORLANDO	My lord the first time that I ever saw him
	Methought he was a brother to your daughter
	But my good lord this boy is forestborn
	And hath been tutord in the rudiments
	Of many desperate studies by his uncle
	Whom he reports to be a great magician
	Obscured in the circle of this forest

	Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY

JAQUES	There is sure another flood toward and these
	couples are coming to the ark Here comes a pair of
	very strange beasts which in all tongues are called fools

TOUCHSTONE	Salutation and greeting to you all
