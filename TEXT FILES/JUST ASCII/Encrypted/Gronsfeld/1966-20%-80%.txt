    main priorities are to maintain a current account surplus in order to pay
    off extensive external debt and to continue to freeze publicsector
    expenditures in order to reduce the budget deficit The rate of growth by
      boosted by increased investment and domestic demand  may be
    sufficient to start to cut Denmarks high unemployment rate which is
