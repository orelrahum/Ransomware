Libya Economy

Overview
    The socialistoriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil
    sector which contributes practically all export earnings and about
    onethird of GDP Since  however the sharp drop in oil prices and the
    resulting decline in export revenues have adversely affected economic
    development In  per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at  but
    GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response to changes in
    the world oil market Import restrictions and inefficient resource
    allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs although
    the reopening of the LibyanTunisian border in April  and the
    LibyanEgyptian border in December  have somewhat eased shortages
    Austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the
    governments ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure
    development projects Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in
    late  improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current
    account surplus for the first time in five years The nonoil manufacturing
    and construction sectors which account for about  of GDP have expanded
    from processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals
    iron steel and aluminum Although agriculture accounts for about  of
    GDP it employs about  of the labor force Climatic conditions and poor
    soils severely limit farm output and Libya imports about  of its food
    requirements
