Mozambique Economy

Overview
    One of Africas poorest countries Mozambique has failed to exploit the
    economic potential of its sizable agricultural hydropower and
    transportation resources Indeed national output consumption and
    investment declined throughout the first half of the s because of
    internal disorders lack of government administrative control and a growing
    foreign debt A sharp increase in foreign aid attracted by an economic
    reform policy has resulted in successive years of economic growth since
     Agricultural output nevertheless is at about only  of its 
    level and grain has to be imported Industry operates at only  of
    capacity The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat
    The continuation of civil strife through  has dimmed chances of foreign
