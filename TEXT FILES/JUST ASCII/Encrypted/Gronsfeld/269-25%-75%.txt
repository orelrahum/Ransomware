	That ever love did make thee run into
	Thou hast not loved
	Or if thou hast not sat as I do now
	Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress praise
	Thou hast not loved
	Or if thou hast not broke from company
	Abruptly as my passion now makes me
	Thou hast not loved
	O Phebe Phebe Phebe

	Exit

ROSALIND	Alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
	I have by hard adventure found mine own

TOUCHSTONE	And I mine I remember when I was in love I broke
	my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
	coming anight to Jane Smile and I remember the
	kissing of her batlet and the cows dugs that her
	pretty chopt hands had milked and I remember the
	wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom I took
	two cods and giving her them again said with
	weeping tears Wear these for my sake We that are
	true lovers run into strange capers but as all is
	mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly

ROSALIND	Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of

TOUCHSTONE	Nay I shall neer be ware of mine own wit till I
	break my shins against it

ROSALIND	Jove Jove this shepherds passion
	Is much upon my fashion

TOUCHSTONE	And mine but it grows something stale with me

CELIA	I pray you one of you question yond man
	If he for gold will give us any food
	I faint almost to death

TOUCHSTONE	Holla you clown

ROSALIND	Peace fool hes not thy kinsman

CORIN	Who calls?

TOUCHSTONE	Your betters sir

CORIN	                  Else are they very wretched

ROSALIND	Peace I say Good even to you friend

CORIN	And to you gentle sir and to you all

ROSALIND	I prithee shepherd if that love or gold
	Can in this desert place buy entertainment
	Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
	Heres a young maid with travel much oppressd
	And faints for succor

CORIN	Fair sir I pity her
	And wish for her sake more than for mine own
	My fortunes were more able to relieve her
	But I am shepherd to another man
	And do not shear the fleeces that I graze
	My master is of churlish disposition
	And little recks to find the way to heaven
	By doing deeds of hospitality
	Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
	Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
	By reason of his absence there is nothing
	That you will feed on but what is come see
	And in my voice most welcome shall you be

ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

CORIN	That young swain that you saw here but erewhile
	That little cares for buying any thing

ROSALIND	I pray thee if it stand with honesty
	Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
	And thou shalt have to pay for it of us

CELIA	And we will mend thy wages I like this place
	And willingly could waste my time in it

CORIN	Assuredly the thing is to be sold
	Go with me if you like upon report
	The soil the profit and this kind of life
	I will your very faithful feeder be
	And buy it with your gold right suddenly

AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself

JAQUES	Well then if ever I thank any man Ill thank you

AMIENS	Well Ill end the song Sirs cover the while the

SCENE VII	The forest


	A table set out Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and
	Lords like outlaws

DUKE SENIOR	I think he be transformd into a beast
	For I can no where find him like a man

First Lord	My lord he is but even now gone hence
	Here was he merry hearing of a song

DUKE SENIOR	If he compact of jars grow musical
	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres
	Go seek him tell him I would speak with him

	Enter JAQUES

First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach

DUKE SENIOR	Why how now monsieur what a life is this
	That your poor friends must woo your company?
	What you look merrily

JAQUES	A fool a fool I met a fool i the forest
	A motley fool a miserable world
	As I do live by food I met a fool
	Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun
	And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms
	In good set terms and yet a motley fool
	Good morrow fool quoth I No sir quoth he
	Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
	And then he drew a dial from his poke
	And looking on it with lacklustre eye
	Says very wisely It is ten oclock
	Thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
	Tis but an hour ago since it was nine
	And after one hour more twill be eleven
	And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
	And then from hour to hour we rot and rot
	And thereby hangs a tale When I did hear
	The motley fool thus moral on the time
	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
	That fools should be so deepcontemplative
	And I did laugh sans intermission
	An hour by his dial O noble fool
	A worthy fool Motleys the only wear

DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?

JAQUES	O worthy fool One that hath been a courtier
	And says if ladies be but young and fair
	They have the gift to know it and in his brain
	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
	After a voyage he hath strange places crammd
	With observation the which he vents
	In mangled forms O that I were a fool
	I am ambitious for a motley coat

DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one

JAQUES	It is my only suit
	Provided that you weed your better judgments
	Of all opinion that grows rank in them
	That I am wise I must have liberty
	Withal as large a charter as the wind
	To blow on whom I please for so fools have
	And they that are most galled with my folly
	They most must laugh And why sir must they so?
	The why is plain as way to parish church
	He that a fool doth very wisely hit
	Doth very foolishly although he smart
	Not to seem senseless of the bob if not
	The wise mans folly is anatomized
	Even by the squandering glances of the fool
	Invest me in my motley give me leave
	To speak my mind and I will through and through
	Cleanse the foul body of the infected world
	If they will patiently receive my medicine

DUKE SENIOR	Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do

JAQUES	What for a counter would I do but good?

DUKE SENIOR	Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
	For thou thyself hast been a libertine
	As sensual as the brutish sting itself
	And all the embossed sores and headed evils
	That thou with licence of free foot hast caught
	Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world

JAQUES	Why who cries out on pride
	That can therein tax any private party?
	Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
	Till that the weary very means do ebb?
	What woman in the city do I name
	When that I say the citywoman bears
	The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
	Who can come in and say that I mean her
	When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
	Or what is he of basest function
	That says his bravery is not of my cost
	Thinking that I mean him but therein suits
	His folly to the mettle of my speech?
	There then how then? what then? Let me see wherein
	My tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right
	Then he hath wrongd himself if he be free
	Why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies
	Unclaimd of any man But who comes here?

	Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn

ORLANDO	Forbear and eat no more

JAQUES	Why I have eat none yet

ORLANDO	Nor shalt not till necessity be served

JAQUES	Of what kind should this cock come of?

DUKE SENIOR	Art thou thus boldend man by thy distress
	Or else a rude despiser of good manners
	That in civility thou seemst so empty?

ORLANDO	You touchd my vein at first the thorny point
	Of bare distress hath taen from me the show
	Of smooth civility yet am I inland bred
	And know some nurture But forbear I say
	He dies that touches any of this fruit
	Till I and my affairs are answered

JAQUES	An you will not be answered with reason I must die

DUKE SENIOR	What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
	More than your force move us to gentleness

ORLANDO	I almost die for food and let me have it

DUKE SENIOR	Sit down and feed and welcome to our table

ORLANDO	Speak you so gently? Pardon me I pray you
	I thought that all things had been savage here
	And therefore put I on the countenance
	Of stern commandment But whateer you are
	That in this desert inaccessible
	Under the shade of melancholy boughs
	Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
	If ever you have lookd on better days
	If ever been where bells have knolld to church
	If ever sat at any good mans feast
	If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
	And know what tis to pity and be pitied
	Let gentleness my strong enforcement be
	In the which hope I blush and hide my sword

DUKE SENIOR	True is it that we have seen better days
	And have with holy bell been knolld to church
	And sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyes
	Of drops that sacred pity hath engenderd
	And therefore sit you down in gentleness
	And take upon command what help we have
	That to your wanting may be ministerd

ORLANDO	Then but forbear your food a little while
	Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn
	And give it food There is an old poor man
	Who after me hath many a weary step
	Limpd in pure love till he be first sufficed
	Oppressd with two weak evils age and hunger
	I will not touch a bit

DUKE SENIOR	Go find him out
	And we will nothing waste till you return

ORLANDO	I thank ye and be blest for your good comfort

	Exit

DUKE SENIOR	Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
	This wide and universal theatre
	Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
	Wherein we play in

JAQUES	All the worlds a stage
	And all the men and women merely players
	They have their exits and their entrances
	And one man in his time plays many parts
	His acts being seven ages At first the infant
	Mewling and puking in the nurses arms
	And then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
	And shining morning face creeping like snail
	Unwillingly to school And then the lover
	Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
	Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier
	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
	Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
	Seeking the bubble reputation
	Even in the cannons mouth And then the justice
	In fair round belly with good capon lined
	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut
	Full of wise saws and modern instances
	And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
	Into the lean and slipperd pantaloon
	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side
	His youthful hose well saved a world too wide
	For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
	Turning again toward childish treble pipes
	And whistles in his sound Last scene of all
	That ends this strange eventful history
	Is second childishness and mere oblivion
	Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything

	Reenter ORLANDO with ADAM

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome Set down your venerable burthen
	And let him feed

ORLANDO	I thank you most for him

ADAM	So had you need
	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome fall to I will not trouble you
	As yet to question you about your fortunes
	Give us some music and good cousin sing

	SONG
AMIENS	Blow blow thou winter wind
	Thou art not so unkind
	As mans ingratitude
	Thy tooth is not so keen
	Because thou art not seen
	Although thy breath be rude
	Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
	Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
	Then heighho the holly
	This life is most jolly
	Freeze freeze thou bitter sky
	That dost not bite so nigh
	As benefits forgot
	Though thou the waters warp
	Thy sting is not so sharp
	As friend rememberd not
	Heighho sing c

DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowlands son
	As you have whisperd faithfully you were
	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
	Most truly limnd and living in your face
	Be truly welcome hither I am the duke
	That loved your father the residue of your fortune
	Go to my cave and tell me Good old man
	Thou art right welcome as thy master is
	Support him by the arm Give me your hand
	And let me all your fortunes understand

	Enter ORLANDO with a paper

ORLANDO	Hang there my verse in witness of my love
	And thou thricecrowned queen of night survey
	With thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above
	Thy huntress name that my full life doth sway
	O Rosalind these trees shall be my books
	And in their barks my thoughts Ill character
	That every eye which in this forest looks
	Shall see thy virtue witnessd every where
	Run run Orlando carve on every tree
	The fair the chaste and unexpressive she

	Exit

	Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CORIN	And how like you this shepherds life Master Touchstone?

TOUCHSTONE	Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
	life but in respect that it is a shepherds life
	it is naught In respect that it is solitary I
	like it very well but in respect that it is
	private it is a very vile life Now in respect it
	is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in
	respect it is not in the court it is tedious As
	is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well
	but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much
	against my stomach Hast any philosophy in thee shepherd?

CORIN	No more but that I know the more one sickens the
	worse at ease he is and that he that wants money
	means and content is without three good friends
	that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
	burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
	great cause of the night is lack of the sun that
	he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
	complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred

TOUCHSTONE	Such a one is a natural philosopher Wast ever in
	court shepherd?

CORIN	No truly

TOUCHSTONE	Then thou art damned

CORIN	Nay I hope

TOUCHSTONE	Truly thou art damned like an illroasted egg all
	on one side

CORIN	For not being at court? Your reason

TOUCHSTONE	Why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest
	good manners if thou never sawest good manners
	then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is
	sin and sin is damnation Thou art in a parlous
	state shepherd

CORIN	Not a whit Touchstone those that are good manners
	at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
	behavior of the country is most mockable at the
	court You told me you salute not at the court but
	you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
	uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds

TOUCHSTONE	Instance briefly come instance

CORIN	Why we are still handling our ewes and their
	fells you know are greasy

TOUCHSTONE	Why do not your courtiers hands sweat? and is not
	the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
	a man? Shallow shallow A better instance I say come

CORIN	Besides our hands are hard

TOUCHSTONE	Your lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again
	A more sounder instance come

CORIN	And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
	our sheep and would you have us kiss tar? The
	courtiers hands are perfumed with civet

TOUCHSTONE	Most shallow man thou wormsmeat in respect of a
	good piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and
	perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the
	very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend the instance shepherd

CORIN	You have too courtly a wit for me Ill rest

TOUCHSTONE	Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee shallow man
	God make incision in thee thou art raw

CORIN	Sir I am a true labourer I earn that I eat get
	that I wear owe no man hate envy no mans
	happiness glad of other mens good content with my
	harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
	graze and my lambs suck

TOUCHSTONE	That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
	and the rams together and to offer to get your
	living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a
	bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a
	twelvemonth to a crookedpated old cuckoldly ram
	out of all reasonable match If thou beest not
	damned for this the devil himself will have no
	shepherds I cannot see else how thou shouldst
	scape

CORIN	Here comes young Master Ganymede my new mistresss brother

	Enter ROSALIND with a paper reading

ROSALIND	     From the east to western Ind
	No jewel is like Rosalind
	Her worth being mounted on the wind
	Through all the world bears Rosalind
	All the pictures fairest lined
	Are but black to Rosalind
	Let no fair be kept in mind
	But the fair of Rosalind

TOUCHSTONE	Ill rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
	suppers and sleepinghours excepted it is the
	right butterwomens rank to market

ROSALIND	Out fool

TOUCHSTONE	For a taste
	If a hart do lack a hind
	Let him seek out Rosalind
	If the cat will after kind
	So be sure will Rosalind
	Winter garments must be lined
	So must slender Rosalind
	They that reap must sheaf and bind
	Then to cart with Rosalind
	Sweetest nut hath sourest rind
	Such a nut is Rosalind
	He that sweetest rose will find
	Must find loves prick and Rosalind
	This is the very false gallop of verses why do you
	infect yourself with them?

ROSALIND	Peace you dull fool I found them on a tree

TOUCHSTONE	Truly the tree yields bad fruit

ROSALIND	Ill graff it with you and then I shall graff it
	with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit
	i the country for youll be rotten ere you be half
	ripe and thats the right virtue of the medlar

TOUCHSTONE	You have said but whether wisely or no let the
	forest judge

	Enter CELIA with a writing

ROSALIND	Peace Here comes my sister reading stand aside

CELIA	Reads

	Why should this a desert be?
	For it is unpeopled? No
	Tongues Ill hang on every tree
	That shall civil sayings show
	Some how brief the life of man
	Runs his erring pilgrimage
	That the stretching of a span
	Buckles in his sum of age
	Some of violated vows
	Twixt the souls of friend and friend
	But upon the fairest boughs
	Or at every sentence end
	Will I Rosalinda write
	Teaching all that read to know
	The quintessence of every sprite
	Heaven would in little show
	Therefore Heaven Nature charged
	That one body should be filld
	With all graces wideenlarged
	Nature presently distilld
	Helens cheek but not her heart
	Cleopatras majesty
	Atalantas better part
	Sad Lucretias modesty
	Thus Rosalind of many parts
	By heavenly synod was devised
	Of many faces eyes and hearts
	To have the touches dearest prized
	Heaven would that she these gifts should have
	And I to live and die her slave

ROSALIND	O most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love
	have you wearied your parishioners withal and never
	cried Have patience good people

CELIA	How now back friends Shepherd go off a little
	Go with him sirrah

TOUCHSTONE	Come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
	though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage

	Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CELIA	Didst thou hear these verses?

ROSALIND	O yes I heard them all and more too for some of
	them had in them more feet than the verses would bear

CELIA	Thats no matter the feet might bear the verses

ROSALIND	Ay but the feet were lame and could not bear
	themselves without the verse and therefore stood
	lamely in the verse

CELIA	But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
	should be hanged and carved upon these trees?

ROSALIND	I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
	before you came for look here what I found on a
	palmtree I was never so berhymed since
	Pythagoras time that I was an Irish rat which I
	can hardly remember
