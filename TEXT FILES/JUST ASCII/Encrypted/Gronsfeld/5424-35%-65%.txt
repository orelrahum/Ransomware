Passed through him  But the ethereal substance closed
Not long divisible and from the gash
A stream of necturous humour issuing flowed
Sanguine such as celestial Spirits may bleed
And all his armour stained ere while so bright
Forthwith on all sides to his aid was run
By Angels many and strong who interposed
Defence while others bore him on their shields
Back to his chariot where it stood retired
From off the files of war  There they him laid
Gnashing for anguish and despite and shame
To find himself not matchless and his pride
Humbled by such rebuke so far beneath
His confidence to equal God in power
Yet soon he healed for Spirits that live throughout
Vital in every part not as frail man
In entrails heart of head liver or reins
Cannot but by annihilating die
Nor in their liquid texture mortal wound
Receive no more than can the fluid air
All heart they live all head all eye all ear
All intellect all sense and as they please
They limb themselves and colour shape or size
Assume as?kikes them best condense or rare
Mean while in other parts like deeds deserved
Memorial where the might of Gabriel fought
And with fierce ensigns pierced the deep array
Of Moloch furious king who him defied
And at his chariotwheels to drag him bound
Threatened nor from the Holy One of Heaven
Refrained his tongue blasphemous but anon
Down cloven to the waist with shattered arms
And uncouth pain fled bellowing  On each wing
Uriel and Raphael his vaunting foe
Though huge and in a rock of diamond armed
Vanquished Adramelech and Asmadai
Two potent Thrones that to be less than Gods
Disdained but meaner thoughts learned in their flight
Mangled with ghastly wounds through plate and mail
Nor stood unmindful Abdiel to annoy
The atheist crew but with redoubled blow
Ariel and Arioch and the violence
Of Ramiel scorched and blasted overthrew
I might relate of thousands and their names
Eternize here on earth but those elect
Angels contented with their fame in Heaven
Seek not the praise of men  The other sort
In might though wonderous and in acts of war
Nor of renown less eager yet by doom
Cancelled from Heaven and sacred memory
Nameless in dark oblivion let them dwell
For strength from truth divided and from just
Illaudable nought merits but dispraise
And ignominy yet to glory aspires
Vainglorious and through infamy seeks fame
Therefore eternal silence be their doom
And now their mightiest quelled the battle swerved
With many an inroad gored deformed rout
Entered and foul disorder all the ground
With shivered armour strown and on a heap
Chariot and charioteer lay overturned
And fieryfoaming steeds what stood recoiled
Oerwearied through the faint Satanick host
Defensive scarce or with pale fear surprised
Then first with fear surprised and sense of pain
Fled ignominious to such evil brought
By sin of disobedience till that hour
Not liable to fear or flight or pain
Far otherwise the inviolable Saints
In cubick phalanx firm advanced entire
Invulnerable impenetrably armed
Such high advantages their innocence
Gave them above their foes not to have sinned
Not to have disobeyed in fight they stood
Unwearied unobnoxious to be pained
By wound though from their place by violence moved
Now Night her course began and over Heaven
Inducing darkness grateful truce imposed
And silence on the odious din of war
Under her cloudy covert both retired
Victor and vanquished  On the foughten field
Michael and his Angels prevalent
Encamping placed in guard their watches round
Cherubick waving fires  On the other part
Satan with his rebellious disappeared
Far in the dark dislodged and void of rest
His potentates to council called by night
And in the midst thus undismayed began
O now in danger tried now known in arms
Not to be overpowered Companions dear
Found worthy not of liberty alone
Too mean pretence but what we more affect
Honour dominion glory and renown
Who have sustained one day in doubtful fight
And if one day why not eternal days?
What Heavens Lord had powerfullest to send
Against us from about his throne and judged
Sufficient to subdue us to his will
But proves not so  Then fallible it seems
Of future we may deem him though till now
Omniscient thought  True is less firmly armed
Some disadvantage we endured and pain
Till now not known but known as soon contemned
Since now we find this our empyreal form
Incapable of mortal injury
Imperishable and though pierced with wound
Soon closing and by native vigour healed
Of evil then so small as easy think
The remedy perhaps more valid arms
Weapons more violent when next we meet
May serve to better us and worse our foes
Or equal what between us made the odds
In nature none  If other hidden cause
Left them superiour while we can preserve
Unhurt our minds and understanding sound
Due search and consultation will disclose
He sat and in the assembly next upstood
Nisroch of Principalities the prime
As one he stood escaped from cruel fight
Sore toiled his riven arms to havock hewn
And cloudy in aspect thus answering spake
Deliverer from new Lords leader to free
Enjoyment of our right as Gods yet hard
For Gods and too unequal work we find
Against unequal arms to fight in pain
Against unpained impassive from which evil
Ruin must needs ensue for what avails
Valour or strength though matchless quelled with pain
Which all subdues and makes remiss the hands
Of mightiest?  Sense of pleasure we may well
Spare out of life perhaps and not repine
But live content which is the calmest life
But pain is perfect misery the worst
Of evils and excessive overturns
All patience  He who therefore can invent
With what more forcible we may offend
Our yet unwounded enemies or arm
Ourselves with like defence to me deserves
No less than for deliverance what we owe
Whereto with look composed Satan replied
Not uninvented that which thou aright
Believest so main to our success I bring
Which of us who beholds the bright surface
Of this ethereous mould whereon we stand
This continent of spacious Heaven adorned
With plant fruit flower ambrosial gems and gold
Whose eye so superficially surveys
These things as not to mind from whence they grow
Deep under ground materials dark and crude
Of spiritous and fiery spume till touched
With Heavens ray and tempered they shoot forth
So beauteous opening to the ambient light?
These in their dark nativity the deep
Shall yield us pregnant with infernal flame
Which into hollow engines long and round
Thick rammed at the other bore with touch of fire
Dilated and infuriate shall send forth
From far with thundering noise among our foes
Such implements of mischief as shall dash
To pieces and oerwhelm whatever stands
Adverse that they shall fear we have disarmed
The Thunderer of his only dreaded bolt
Nor long shall be our labour yet ere dawn
Effect shall end our wish  Mean while revive
Abandon fear to strength and counsel joined
Think nothing hard much less to be despaired
He ended and his words their drooping cheer
Enlightened and their languished hope revived
The invention all admired and each how he
To be the inventer missed so easy it seemed
Once found which yet unfound most would have thought
Impossible  Yet haply of thy race
In future days if malice should abound
Some one intent on mischief or inspired
With devilish machination might devise
Like instrument to plague the sons of men
For sin on war and mutual slaughter bent
Forthwith from council to the work they flew
None arguing stood innumerable hands
Were ready in a moment up they turned
Wide the celestial soil and saw beneath
The originals of nature in their crude
Conception sulphurous and nitrous foam
They found they mingled and with subtle art
Concocted and adusted they reduced
To blackest grain and into store conveyed
Part hidden veins digged up nor hath this earth
Entrails unlike of mineral and stone
Whereof to found their engines and their balls
Of missive ruin part incentive reed
Provide pernicious with one touch to fire
So all ere dayspring under conscious night
Secret they finished and in order set
With silent circumspection unespied
Now when fair morn orient in Heaven appeared
Up rose the victorAngels and to arms
The matin trumpet sung  In arms they stood
Of golden panoply refulgent host
Soon banded others from the dawning hills
Look round and scouts each coast lightarmed scour
Each quarter to descry the distant foe
Where lodged or whither fled or if for fight
In motion or in halt  Him soon they met
Under spread ensigns moving nigh in slow
But firm battalion back with speediest sail
Zophiel of Cherubim the swiftest wing
Came flying and in mid air aloud thus cried
Arm Warriours arm for fight the foe at hand
Whom fled we thought will save us long pursuit
This day fear not his flightso thick a cloud
He comes and settled in his face I see
Sad resolution and secure  Let each
His adamantine coat gird well and each
Fit well his helm gripe fast his orbed shield
Borne even or high for this day will pour down
If I conjecture aught no drizzling shower
But rattling storm of arrows barbed with fire
So warned he them aware themselves and soon
In order quit of all impediment
Instant without disturb they took alarm
And onward moved embattled  When behold
Not distant far with heavy pace the foe
Approaching gross and huge in hollow cube
Training his devilish enginery impaled
On every side with shadowing squadrons deep
To hide the fraud  At interview both stood
A while but suddenly at head appeared
Satan and thus was heard commanding loud
Vanguard to right and left the front unfold
That all may see who hate us how we seek
Peace and composure and with open breast
Stand ready to receive them if they like
Our overture and turn not back perverse
But that I doubt however witness Heaven
Heaven witness thou anon while we discharge
Freely our part ye who appointed stand
Do as you have in charge and briefly touch
What we propound and loud that all may hear
So scoffing in ambiguous words he scarce
Had ended when to right and left the front
Divided and to either flank retired
Which to our eyes discovered new and strange
A triple mounted row of pillars laid
On wheels for like to pillars most they seemed
Or hollowed bodies made of oak or fir
With branches lopt in wood or mountain felled
Brass iron stony mould had not their mouths
With hideous orifice gaped on us wide
Portending hollow truce  At each behind
A Seraph stood and in his hand a reed
Stood waving tipt with fire while we suspense
Collected stood within our thoughts amused
Not long for sudden all at once their reeds
Put forth and to a narrow vent applied
With nicest touch  Immediate in a flame
But soon obscured with smoke all Heaven appeared
From those deepthroated engines belched whose roar
Embowelled with outrageous noise the air
And all her entrails tore disgorging foul
Their devilish glut chained thunderbolts and hail
Of iron globes which on the victor host
Levelled with such impetuous fury smote
That whom they hit none on their feet might stand
Though standing else as rocks but down they fell
By thousands Angel on ArchAngel rolled
The sooner for their arms unarmed they might
Have easily as Spirits evaded swift
By quick contraction or remove but now
Foul dissipation followed and forced rout
Nor served it to relax their serried files
What should they do? if on they rushed repulse
Repeated and indecent overthrow
Doubled would render them yet more despised
And to their foes a laughter for in view
Stood ranked of Seraphim another row
In posture to displode their second tire
Of thunder  Back defeated to return
They worse abhorred  Satan beheld their plight
And to his mates thus in derision called
O Friends why come not on these victors proud
Ere while they fierce were coming and when we
To entertain them fair with open front
And breast what could we more? propounded terms
Of composition straight they changed their minds
Flew off and into strange vagaries fell
As they would dance yet for a dance they seemed
Somewhat extravagant and wild perhaps
For joy of offered peace  But I suppose
If our proposals once again were heard
We should compel them to a quick result
To whom thus Belial in like gamesome mood
Leader the terms we sent were terms of weight
Of hard contents and full of force urged home
Such as we might perceive amused them all
And stumbled many  Who receives them right
Had need from head to foot well understand
Not understood this gift they have besides
They show us when our foes walk not upright
So they among themselves in pleasant vein
Stood scoffing hightened in their thoughts beyond
All doubt of victory  Eternal Might
To match with their inventions they presumed
So easy and of his thunder made a scorn
And all his host derided while they stood
A while in trouble  But they stood not long
Rage prompted them at length and found them arms
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose
Forthwith behold the excellence the power
Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed
Their arms away they threw and to the hills
For Earth hath this variety from Heaven
Of pleasure situate in hill and dale
Light as the lightning glimpse they ran they flew
From their foundations loosening to and fro
They plucked the seated hills with all their load
Rocks waters woods and by the shaggy tops
Uplifting bore them in their hands  Amaze
Be sure and terrour seized the rebel host
When coming towards them so dread they saw
The bottom of the mountains upward turned
Till on those cursed engines triplerow
They saw them whelmed and all their confidence
Under the weight of mountains buried deep
Themselves invaded next and on their heads
Main promontories flung which in the air
Came shadowing and oppressed whole legions armed
Their armour helped their harm crushed in and bruised
Into their substance pent which wrought them pain
Implacable and many a dolorous groan
Long struggling underneath ere they could wind
Out of such prison though Spirits of purest light
Purest at first now gross by sinning grown
The rest in imitation to like arms
Betook them and the neighbouring hills uptore
So hills amid the air encountered hills
Hurled to and fro with jaculation dire
That under ground they fought in dismal shade
Infernal noise war seemed a civil game
To this uproar horrid confusion heaped
Upon confusion rose  And now all Heaven
Had gone to wrack with ruin overspread
Had not the Almighty Father where he sits
Shrined in his sanctuary of Heaven secure
Consulting on the sum of things foreseen
This tumult and permitted all advised
That his great purpose he might so fulfil
To honour his anointed Son avenged
Upon his enemies and to declare
All power on him transferred  Whence to his Son
The Assessour of his throne he thus began
Effulgence of my glory Son beloved
Son in whose face invisible is beheld
Visibly what by Deity I am
And in whose hand what by decree I do
Second Omnipotence two days are past
Two days as we compute the days of Heaven
Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame
These disobedient  Sore hath been their fight
As likeliest was when two such foes met armed
For to themselves I left them and thou knowest
Equal in their creation they were formed
Save what sin hath impaired which yet hath wrought
Insensibly for I suspend their doom
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
Endless and no solution will be found
War wearied hath performed what war can do
And to disordered rage let loose the reins
With mountains as with weapons armed which makes
Wild work in Heaven and dangerous to the main
Two days are therefore past the third is thine
For thee I have ordained it and thus far
Have suffered that the glory may be thine
Of ending this great war since none but Thou
Can end it  Into thee such virtue and grace
Immense I have transfused that all may know
In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare
And this perverse commotion governed thus
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
Of all things to be Heir and to be King
By sacred unction thy deserved right
Go then Thou Mightiest in thy Fathers might
Ascend my chariot guide the rapid wheels
That shake Heavens basis bring forth all my war
My bow and thunder my almighty arms
Gird on and sword upon thy puissant thigh
Pursue these sons of darkness drive them out
From all Heavens bounds into the utter deep
There let them learn as likes them to despise
God and Messiah his anointed King
He said and on his Son with rays direct
Shone full he all his Father full expressed
Ineffably into his face received
And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake
O Father O Supreme of heavenly Thrones
First Highest Holiest Best thou always seekst
To glorify thy Son I always thee
As is most just  This I my glory account
My exaltation and my whole delight
That thou in me well pleased declarest thy will
Fulfilled which to fulfil is all my bliss
Scepter and power thy giving I assume
And gladlier shall resign when in the end
Thou shalt be all in all and I in thee
For ever and in me all whom thou lovest
But whom thou hatest I hate and can put on
Thy terrours as I put thy mildness on
Image of thee in all things and shall soon
Armed with thy might rid Heaven of these rebelled
To their prepared ill mansion driven down
To chains of darkness and the undying worm
That from thy just obedience could revolt
Whom to obey is happiness entire
Then shall thy Saints unmixed and from the impure
Far separate circling thy holy mount
Unfeigned Halleluiahs to thee sing
Hymns of high praise and I among them Chief
So said he oer his scepter bowing rose
From the right hand of Glory where he sat
And the third sacred morn began to shine
Dawning through Heaven  Forth rushed with whirlwind sound
The chariot of Paternal Deity
Flashing thick flames wheel within wheel undrawn
Itself instinct with Spirit but convoyed
By four Cherubick shapes four faces each
Had wonderous as with stars their bodies all
And wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels
Of beryl and careering fires between
Over their heads a crystal firmament
Whereon a sapphire throne inlaid with pure
Amber and colours of the showery arch
He in celestial panoply all armed
Of radiant Urim work divinely wrought
Ascended at his right hand Victory
Sat eaglewinged beside him hung his bow
And quiver with threebolted thunder stored
And from about him fierce effusion rolled
Of smoke and bickering flame and sparkles dire
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints
He onward came far off his coming shone
And twenty thousand I their number heard
Chariots of God half on each hand were seen
He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
On the crystalline sky in sapphire throned
Illustrious far and wide but by his own
First seen  Them unexpected joy surprised
When the great ensign of Messiah blazed
Aloft by Angels borne his sign in Heaven
Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced
His army circumfused on either wing
Under their Head imbodied all in one
Before him Power Divine his way prepared
At his command the uprooted hills retired
Each to his place they heard his voice and went
Obsequious Heaven his wonted face renewed
And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled
This saw his hapless foes but stood obdured
And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers
Insensate hope conceiving from despair
In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
But to convince the proud what signs avail
Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?
They hardened more by what might most reclaim
Grieving to see his glory at the sight
Took envy and aspiring to his highth
Stood reembattled fierce by force or fraud
Weening to prosper and at length prevail
Against God and Messiah or to fall
In universal ruin last and now
To final battle drew disdaining flight
Or faint retreat when the great Son of God
To all his host on either hand thus spake
Stand still in bright array ye Saints here stand
Ye Angels armed this day from battle rest
Faithful hath been your warfare and of God
Accepted fearless in his righteous cause
And as ye have received so have ye done
Invincibly  But of this cursed crew
The punishment to other hand belongs
Vengeance is his or whose he sole appoints
Number to this days work is not ordained
Nor multitude stand only and behold
Gods indignation on these godless poured
By me not you but me they have despised
Yet envied against me is all their rage
Because the Father to whom in Heaven spreme
Kingdom and power and glory appertains
Hath honoured me according to his will
Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned
That they may have their wish to try with me
In battle which the stronger proves they all
Or I alone against them since by strength
They measure all of other excellence
Not emulous nor care who them excels
Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe
So spake the Son and into terrour changed
His countenance too severe to be beheld
And full of wrath bent on his enemies
At once the Four spread out their starry wings
With dreadful shade contiguous and the orbs
Of his fierce chariot rolled as with the sound
Of torrent floods or of a numerous host
He on his impious foes right onward drove
Gloomy as night under his burning wheels
The stedfast empyrean shook throughout
All but the throne itself of God  Full soon
Among them he arrived in his right hand
Grasping ten thousand thunders which he sent
Before him such as in their souls infixed
Plagues  They astonished all resistance lost
All courage down their idle weapons dropt
Oer shields and helms and helmed heads he rode
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate
That wished the mountains now might be again
Thrown on them as a shelter from his ire
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
His arrows from the fourfoldvisaged Four
Distinct with eyes and from the living wheels
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes
One Spirit in them ruled and every eye
Glared lightning and shot forth pernicious fire
Among the accursed that withered all their strength
And of their wonted vigour left them drained
Exhausted spiritless afflicted fallen
Yet half his strength he put not forth but checked
His thunder in mid volley for he meant
Not to destroy but root them out of Heaven
The overthrown he raised and as a herd
Of goats or timorous flock together thronged
Drove them before him thunderstruck pursued
With terrours and with furies to the bounds
And crystal wall of Heaven which opening wide
Rolled inward and a spacious gap disclosed
Into the wasteful deep  The monstrous sight
Struck them with horrour backward but far worse
Urged them behind  Headlong themselves they threw
Down from the verge of Heaven eternal wrath
Burnt after them to the bottomless pit
Hell heard the unsufferable noise Hell saw
Heaven ruining from Heaven and would have fled
Affrighted but strict Fate had cast too deep
Her dark foundations and too fast had bound
Nine days they fell  Confounded Chaos roared
And felt tenfold confusion in their fall
Through his wild anarchy so huge a rout
Incumbered him with ruin  Hell at last
Yawning received them whole and on them closed
Hell their fit habitation fraught with fire
Unquenchable the house of woe and pain
Disburdened Heaven rejoiced and soon repaired
Her mural breach returning whence it rolled
Sole victor from the expulsion of his foes
Messiah his triumphal chariot turned
To meet him all his Saints who silent stood
Eyewitnesses of his almighty acts
With jubilee advanced and as they went
Shaded with branching palm each Order bright
Sung triumph and him sung victorious King
Son Heir and Lord to him dominion given
Worthiest to reign  He celebrated rode
Triumphant through mid Heaven into the courts
And temple of his Mighty Father throned
On high who into glory him received
Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss
Thus measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth
At thy request and that thou mayest beware
By what is past to thee I have revealed
What might have else to human race been hid
The discord which befel and war in Heaven
Among the angelick Powers and the deep fall
Of those too high aspiring who rebelled
With Satan he who envies now thy state
Who now is plotting how he may seduce
Thee also from obedience that with him
Bereaved of happiness thou mayest partake
His punishment eternal misery
Which would be all his solace and revenge
As a despite done against the Most High
Thee once to gain companion of his woe
But listen not to his temptations warn
Thy weaker let it profit thee to have heard
By terrible example the reward
Of disobedience firm they might have stood
Yet fell remember and fear to transgress



Book VII


Descend from Heaven Urania by that name
If rightly thou art called whose voice divine
Following above the Olympian hill I soar
Above the flight of Pegasean wing
The meaning not the name I call for thou
Nor of the Muses nine nor on the top
Of old Olympus dwellest but heavenlyborn
Before the hills appeared or fountain flowed
Thou with eternal Wisdom didst converse
Wisdom thy sister and with her didst play
In presence of the Almighty Father pleased
With thy celestial song  Up led by thee
Into the Heaven of Heavens I have presumed
An earthly guest and drawn empyreal air
Thy tempering with like safety guided down
Return me to my native element
Lest from this flying steed unreined as once
Bellerophon though from a lower clime
Dismounted on the Aleian field I fall
Erroneous there to wander and forlorn
Half yet remains unsung but narrower bound
Within the visible diurnal sphere
Standing on earth not rapt above the pole
More safe I sing with mortal voice unchanged
To hoarse or mute though fallen on evil days
On evil days though fallen and evil tongues
In darkness and with dangers compassed round
And solitude yet not alone while thou
Visitest my slumbers nightly or when morn
Purples the east still govern thou my song
Urania and fit audience find though few
But drive far off the barbarous dissonance
Of Bacchus and his revellers the race
Of that wild rout that tore the Thracian bard
In Rhodope where woods and rocks had ears
To rapture till the savage clamour drowned
Both harp and voice nor could the Muse defend
Her son  So fail not thou who thee implores
For thou art heavenly she an empty dream
Say Goddess what ensued when Raphael
The affable ArchAngel had forewarned
Adam by dire example to beware
Apostasy by what befel in Heaven
To those apostates lest the like befall
In Paradise to Adam or his race
Charged not to touch the interdicted tree
If they transgress and slight that sole command
So easily obeyed amid the choice
Of all tastes else to please their appetite
Though wandering  He with his consorted Eve
The story heard attentive and was filled
With admiration and deep muse to hear
Of things so high and strange things to their thought
So unimaginable as hate in Heaven
And war so near the peace of God in bliss
With such confusion but the evil soon
Driven back redounded as a flood on those
From whom it sprung impossible to mix
With blessedness  Whence Adam soon repealed
The doubts that in his heart arose and now
Led on yet sinless with desire to know
What nearer might concern him how this world
Of Heaven and Earth conspicuous first began
When and whereof created for what cause
What within Eden or without was done
Before his memory as one whose drouth
Yet scarce allayed still eyes the current stream
Whose liquid murmur heard new thirst excites
Proceeded thus to ask his heavenly guest
Great things and full of wonder in our ears
Far differing from this world thou hast revealed
Divine interpreter by favour sent
Down from the empyrean to forewarn
Us timely of what might else have been our loss
Unknown which human knowledge could not reach
For which to the infinitely Good we owe
Immortal thanks and his admonishment
Receive with solemn purpose to observe
Immutably his sovran will the end
Of what we are  But since thou hast vouchsafed
Gently for our instruction to impart
Things above earthly thought which yet concerned
Our knowing as to highest wisdom seemed
Deign to descend now lower and relate
What may no less perhaps avail us known
How first began this Heaven which we behold
Distant so high with moving fires adorned
Innumerable and this which yields or fills
All space the ambient air wide interfused
Embracing round this floried Earth what cause
Moved the Creator in his holy rest
Through all eternity so late to build
In Chaos and the work begun how soon
Absolved if unforbid thou mayest unfold
What we not to explore the secrets ask
Of his eternal empire but the more
To magnify his works the more we know
And the great light of day yet wants to run
Much of his race though steep suspense in Heaven
Held by thy voice thy potent voice he hears
And longer will delay to hear thee tell
His generation and the rising birth
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep
Or if the star of evening and the moon
Haste to thy audience Night with her will bring
Silence and Sleep listening to thee will watch
Or we can bid his absence till thy song
End and dismiss thee ere the morning shine
Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought
And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild
This also thy request with caution asked
Obtain though to recount almighty works
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
Yet what thou canst attain which best may serve
To glorify the Maker and infer
Thee also happier shall not be withheld
Thy hearing such commission from above
I have received to answer thy desire
Of knowledge within bounds beyond abstain
To ask nor let thine own inventions hope
Things not revealed which the invisible King
Only Omniscient hath suppressed in night
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven
Enough is left besides to search and know
But knowledge is as food and needs no less
Her temperance over appetite to know
In measure what the mind may well contain
Oppresses else with surfeit and soon turns
Wisdom to folly as nourishment to wind
Know then that after Lucifer from Heaven
So call him brighter once amidst the host
Of Angels than that star the stars among
