Of dauntless courage and considerate pride
Waiting revenge Cruel his eye but cast
Signs of remorse and passion to behold
The fellows of his crime the followers rather
Far other once beheld in bliss condemned
For ever now to have their lot in pain
Millions of Spirits for his fault amerced
Of Heaven and from eteranl splendours flung
For his revoltyet faithful how they stood
Their glory withered as when heavens fire
Hath scathed the forest oaks or mountain pines
With singed top their stately growth though bare
Stands on the blasted heath He now prepared
To speak whereat their doubled ranks they bend
From wing to wing and half enclose him round
With all his peers attention held them mute
Thrice he assayed and thrice in spite of scorn
Tears such as Angels weep burst forth at last
Words interwove with sighs found out their way
  "O myriads of immortal Spirits O Powers
Matchless but with th Almighthand that strife
Was not inglorious though th event was dire
As this place testifies and this dire change
Hateful to utter But what power of mind
Forseeing or presaging from the depth
Of knowledge past or present could have feared
How such united force of gods how such
As stood like these could ever know repulse?
For who can yet believe though after loss
That all these puissant legions whose exile
Hath emptied Heaven shall fail to reascend
Selfraised and repossess their native seat?
For me be witness all the host of Heaven
If counsels different or danger shunned
By me have lost our hopes But he who reigns
Monarch in Heaven till then as one secure
Sat on his throne upheld by old repute
Consent or custom and his regal state
Put forth at full but still his strength concealed
Which tempted our attempt and wrought our fall
Henceforth his might we know and know our own
So as not either to provoke or dread
New war provoked our better part remains
To work in close design by fraud or guile
What force effected not that he no less
At length from us may find who overcomes
By force hath overcome but half his foe
Space may produce new Worlds whereof so rife
There went a fame in Heaven that he ere long
Intended to create and therein plant
A generation whom his choice regard
Should favour equal to the Sons of Heaven
Thither if but to pry shall be perhaps
Our first eruptionthither or elsewhere
For this infernal pit shall never hold
Celestial Spirits in bondage nor th Abyss
Long under darkness cover But these thoughts
Full counsel must mature Peace is despaired
For who can think submission? War then war
Open or understood must be resolved"
  He spake and to confirm his words outflew
Millions of flaming swords drawn from the thighs
Of mighty Cherubim the sudden blaze
Far round illumined Hell Highly they raged
Against the Highest and fierce with grasped arms
Clashed on their sounding shields the din of war
Hurling defiance toward the vault of Heaven
  There stood a hill not far whose grisly top
Belched fire and rolling smoke the rest entire
Shone with a glossy scurfundoubted sign
That in his womb was hid metallic ore
The work of sulphur Thither winged with speed
A numerous brigade hastened as when bands
Of pioneers with spade and pickaxe armed
Forerun the royal camp to trench a field
Or cast a rampart Mammon led them on
Mammon the least erected Spirit that fell
From Heaven for even in Heaven his looks and thoughts
Were always downward bent admiring more
The riches of heavens pavement trodden gold
Than aught divine or holy else enjoyed
In vision beatific By him first
Men also and by his suggestion taught
Ransacked the centre and with impious hands
Rifled the bowels of their mother Earth
For treasures better hid Soon had his crew
Opened into the hill a spacious wound
And digged out ribs of gold Let none admire
That riches grow in Hell that soil may best
Deserve the precious bane And here let those
Who boast in mortal things and wondering tell
Of Babel and the works of Memphian kings
Learn how their greatest monuments of fame
And strength and art are easily outdone
By Spirits reprobate and in an hour
What in an age they with incessant toil
And hands innumerable scarce perform
Nigh on the plain in many cells prepared
That underneath had veins of liquid fire
Sluiced from the lake a second multitude
With wondrous art founded the massy ore
Severing each kind and scummed the bulliondross
A third as soon had formed within the ground
A various mould and from the boiling cells
By strange conveyance filled each hollow nook
As in an organ from one blast of wind
To many a row of pipes the soundboard breathes
Anon out of the earth a fabric huge
Rose like an exhalation with the sound
Of dulcet symphonies and voices sweet
Built like a temple where pilasters round
Were set and Doric pillars overlaid
With golden architrave nor did there want
Cornice or frieze with bossy sculptures graven
The roof was fretted gold Not Babylon
Nor great Alcairo such magnificence
Equalled in all their glories to enshrine
Belus or Serapis their gods or seat
Their kings when Egypt with Assyria strove
In wealth and luxury Th ascending pile
Stood fixed her stately height and straight the doors
Opening their brazen folds discover wide
Within her ample spaces oer the smooth
And level pavement from the arched roof
Pendent by subtle magic many a row
Of starry lamps and blazing cressets fed
With naptha and asphaltus yielded light
As from a sky The hasty multitude
Admiring entered and the work some praise
And some the architect His hand was known
In Heaven by many a towered structure high
Where sceptred Angels held their residence
And sat as Princes whom the supreme King
Exalted to such power and gave to rule
Each in his Hierarchy the Orders bright
Nor was his name unheard or unadored
In ancient Greece and in Ausonian land
Men called him Mulciber and how he fell
From Heaven they fabled thrown by angry Jove
Sheer oer the crystal battlements from morn
To noon he fell from noon to dewy eve
A summers day and with the setting sun
Dropt from the zenith like a falling star
On Lemnos th Aegaean isle Thus they relate
Erring for he with this rebellious rout
Fell long before nor aught aviled him now
To have built in Heaven high towers nor did he scape
By all his engines but was headlong sent
With his industrious crew to build in Hell
  Meanwhile the winged Heralds by command
Of sovereign power with awful ceremony
And trumpets sound throughout the host proclaim
A solemn council forthwith to be held
At Pandemonium the high capital
Of Satan and his peers Their summons called
From every band and squared regiment
By place or choice the worthiest they anon
With hundreds and with thousands trooping came
Attended All access was thronged the gates
And porches wide but chief the spacious hall
Though like a covered field where champions bold
Wont ride in armed and at the Soldans chair
Defied the best of Paynim chivalry
To mortal combat or career with lance
Thick swarmed both on the ground and in the air
Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings As bees
In springtime when the Sun with Taurus rides
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
In clusters they among fresh dews and flowers
Fly to and fro or on the smoothed plank
The suburb of their strawbuilt citadel
New rubbed with balm expatiate and confer
Their stateaffairs so thick the airy crowd
Swarmed and were straitened till the signal given
Behold a wonder They but now who seemed
In bigness to surpass Earths giant sons
Now less than smallest dwarfs in narrow room
Throng numberlesslike that pygmean race
Beyond the Indian mount or faery elves
Whose midnight revels by a forestside
Or fountain some belated peasant sees
Or dreams he sees while overhead the Moon
Sits arbitress and nearer to the Earth
Wheels her pale course they on their mirth and dance
Intent with jocund music charm his ear
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds
Thus incorporeal Spirits to smallest forms
Reduced their shapes immense and were at large
Though without number still amidst the hall
Of that infernal court But far within
And in their own dimensions like themselves
The great Seraphic Lords and Cherubim
In close recess and secret conclave sat
A thousand demigods on golden seats
Frequent and full After short silence then
And summons read the great consult began



Book II


High on a throne of royal state which far
Outshone the wealth or Ormus and of Ind
Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand
Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold
Satan exalted sat by merit raised
To that bad eminence and from despair
Thus high uplifted beyond hope aspires
Beyond thus high insatiate to pursue
Vain war with Heaven and by success untaught
His proud imaginations thus displayed
  "Powers and Dominions Deities of Heaven
For since no deep within her gulf can hold
Immortal vigour though oppressed and fallen
I give not Heaven for lost from this descent
Celestial Virtues rising will appear
More glorious and more dread than from no fall
And trust themselves to fear no second fate
Me though just right and the fixed laws of Heaven
Did first create your leadernext free choice
With what besides in council or in fight
Hath been achieved of merityet this loss
Thus far at least recovered hath much more
Established in a safe unenvied throne
Yielded with full consent The happier state
In Heaven which follows dignity might draw
Envy from each inferior but who here
Will envy whom the highest place exposes
Foremost to stand against the Thunderers aim
Your bulwark and condemns to greatest share
Of endless pain? Where there is then no good
For which to strive no strife can grow up there
From faction for none sure will claim in Hell
Precedence none whose portion is so small
Of present pain that with ambitious mind
Will covet more With this advantage then
To union and firm faith and firm accord
More than can be in Heaven we now return
To claim our just inheritance of old
Surer to prosper than prosperity
Could have assured us and by what best way
Whether of open war or covert guile
We now debate Who can advise may speak"
  He ceased and next him Moloch sceptred king
Stood upthe strongest and the fiercest Spirit
That fought in Heaven now fiercer by despair
His trust was with th Eternal to be deemed
Equal in strength and rather than be less
Cared not to be at all with that care lost
Went all his fear of God or Hell or worse
He recked not and these words thereafter spake
  "My sentence is for open war Of wiles
More unexpert I boast not them let those
Contrive who need or when they need not now
For while they sit contriving shall the rest
Millions that stand in arms and longing wait
The signal to ascendsit lingering here
Heavens fugitives and for their dwellingplace
Accept this dark opprobrious den of shame
The prison of his ryranny who reigns
By our delay? No let us rather choose
Armed with Hellflames and fury all at once
Oer Heavens high towers to force resistless way
Turning our tortures into horrid arms
Against the Torturer when to meet the noise
Of his almighty engine he shall hear
Infernal thunder and for lightning see
Black fire and horror shot with equal rage
Among his Angels and his throne itself
Mixed with Tartarean sulphur and strange fire
His own invented torments But perhaps
The way seems difficult and steep to scale
With upright wing against a higher foe
Let such bethink them if the sleepy drench
Of that forgetful lake benumb not still
That in our porper motion we ascend
Up to our native seat descent and fall
To us is adverse Who but felt of late
When the fierce foe hung on our broken rear
Insulting and pursued us through the Deep
With what compulsion and laborious flight
We sunk thus low? Th ascent is easy then
Th event is feared Should we again provoke
Our stronger some worse way his wrath may find
To our destruction if there be in Hell
Fear to be worse destroyed What can be worse
Than to dwell here driven out from bliss condemned
In this abhorred deep to utter woe
Where pain of unextinguishable fire
Must exercise us without hope of end
The vassals of his anger when the scourge
Inexorably and the torturing hour
Calls us to penance? More destroyed than thus
We should be quite abolished and expire
What fear we then? what doubt we to incense
His utmost ire? which to the height enraged
Will either quite consume us and reduce
To nothing this essentialhappier far
Than miserable to have eternal being
Or if our substance be indeed divine
And cannot cease to be we are at worst
On this side nothing and by proof we feel
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven
And with perpetual inroads to alarm
Though inaccessible his fatal throne
Which if not victory is yet revenge"
  He ended frowning and his look denounced
Desperate revenge and battle dangerous
To less than gods On th other side up rose
Belial in act more graceful and humane
A fairer person lost not Heaven he seemed
For dignity composed and high exploit
But all was false and hollow though his tongue
Dropped manna and could make the worse appear
The better reason to perplex and dash
Maturest counsels for his thoughts were low
 To vice industrious but to nobler deeds
Timorous and slothful Yet he pleased the ear
And with persuasive accent thus began
  "I should be much for open war O Peers
As not behind in hate if what was urged
Main reason to persuade immediate war
Did not dissuade me most and seem to cast
Ominous conjecture on the whole success
When he who most excels in fact of arms
In what he counsels and in what excels
Mistrustful grounds his courage on despair
And utter dissolution as the scope
Of all his aim after some dire revenge
First what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled
With armed watch that render all access
Impregnable oft on the bodering Deep
Encamp their legions or with obscure wing
Scout far and wide into the realm of Night
Scorning surprise Or could we break our way
By force and at our heels all Hell should rise
With blackest insurrection to confound
Heavens purest light yet our great Enemy
All incorruptible would on his throne
Sit unpolluted and th ethereal mould
Incapable of stain would soon expel
Her mischief and purge off the baser fire
Victorious Thus repulsed our final hope
Is flat despair we must exasperate
Th Almighty Victor to spend all his rage
And that must end us that must be our cure
To be no more Sad cure for who would lose
Though full of pain this intellectual being
Those thoughts that wander through eternity
To perish rather swallowed up and lost
In the wide womb of uncreated Night
Devoid of sense and motion? And who knows
Let this be good whether our angry Foe
Can give it or will ever? How he can
Is doubtful that he never will is sure
Will he so wise let loose at once his ire
Belike through impotence or unaware
To give his enemies their wish and end
Them in his anger whom his anger saves
To punish endless? Wherefore cease we then?
Say they who counsel war we are decreed
Reserved and destined to eternal woe
Whatever doing what can we suffer more
What can we suffer worse? Is this then worst
Thus sitting thus consulting thus in arms?
What when we fled amain pursued and struck
With Heavens afflicting thunder and besought
The Deep to shelter us? This Hell then seemed
A refuge from those wounds Or when we lay
Chained on the burning lake? That sure was worse
What if the breath that kindled those grim fires
Awaked should blow them into sevenfold rage
And plunge us in the flames or from above
Should intermitted vengeance arm again
His red right hand to plague us? What if all
Her stores were opened and this firmament
Of Hell should spout her cataracts of fire
Impendent horrors threatening hideous fall
One day upon our heads while we perhaps
Designing or exhorting glorious war
Caught in a fiery tempest shall be hurled
Each on his rock transfixed the sport and prey
Or racking whirlwinds or for ever sunk
Under yon boiling ocean wrapt in chains
There to converse with everlasting groans
Unrespited unpitied unreprieved
Ages of hopeless end? This would be worse
War therefore open or concealed alike
My voice dissuades for what can force or guile
With him or who deceive his mind whose eye
Views all things at one view? He from Heavens height
All these our motions vain sees and derides
Not more almighty to resist our might
Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles
Shall we then live thus vilethe race of Heaven
Thus trampled thus expelled to suffer here
Chains and these torments? Better these than worse
By my advice since fate inevitable
Subdues us and omnipotent decree
The Victors will To suffer as to do
Our strength is equal nor the law unjust
That so ordains This was at first resolved
If we were wise against so great a foe
Contending and so doubtful what might fall
I laugh when those who at the spear are bold
And venturous if that fail them shrink and fear
What yet they know must followto endure
Exile or igominy or bonds or pain
The sentence of their Conqueror This is now
Our doom which if we can sustain and bear
Our Supreme Foe in time may much remit
His anger and perhaps thus far removed
Not mind us not offending satisfied
With what is punished whence these raging fires
Will slacken if his breath stir not their flames
Our purer essence then will overcome
Their noxious vapour or inured not feel
Or changed at length and to the place conformed
In temper and in nature will receive
Familiar the fierce heat and void of pain
This horror will grow mild this darkness light
Besides what hope the neverending flight
Of future days may bring what chance what change
Worth waitingsince our present lot appears
For happy though but ill for ill not worst
If we procure not to ourselves more woe"
  Thus Belial with words clothed in reasons garb
Counselled ignoble ease and peaceful sloth
Not peace and after him thus Mammon spake
  "Either to disenthrone the King of Heaven
We war if war be best or to regain
Our own right lost Him to unthrone we then
May hope when everlasting Fate shall yield
To fickle Chance and Chaos judge the strife
