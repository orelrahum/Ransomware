SCENE III	Before OLIVERS house


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM meeting

ORLANDO	Whos there?

ADAM	What my young master? O my gentle master
	O my sweet master O you memory
	Of old Sir Rowland why what make you here?
	Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
	And wherefore are you gentle strong and valiant?
	Why would you be so fond to overcome
	The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
	Your praise is come too swiftly home before you
	Know you not master to some kind of men
	Their graces serve them but as enemies?
	No more do yours your virtues gentle master
	Are sanctified and holy traitors to you
	O what a world is this when what is comely
	Envenoms him that bears it

ORLANDO	Why whats the matter?

ADAM	O unhappy youth
	Come not within these doors within this roof
	The enemy of all your graces lives
	Your brotherno no brother yet the son
	Yet not the son I will not call him son
	Of him I was about to call his father
	Hath heard your praises and this night he means
	To burn the lodging where you use to lie
	And you within it if he fail of that
	He will have other means to cut you off
	I overheard him and his practises
	This is no place this house is but a butchery
	Abhor it fear it do not enter it

ORLANDO	Why whither Adam wouldst thou have me go?

ADAM	No matter whither so you come not here

ORLANDO	What wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
	Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
	A thievish living on the common road?
	This I must do or know not what to do
	Yet this I will not do do how I can
	I rather will subject me to the malice
	Of a diverted blood and bloody brother

ADAM	But do not so I have five hundred crowns
	The thrifty hire I saved under your father
	Which I did store to be my fosternurse
	When service should in my old limbs lie lame
	And unregarded age in corners thrown
	Take that and He that doth the ravens feed
	Yea providently caters for the sparrow
	Be comfort to my age Here is the gold
	And all this I give you Let me be your servant
	Though I look old yet I am strong and lusty
	For in my youth I never did apply
	Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood
	Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
	The means of weakness and debility
	Therefore my age is as a lusty winter
	Frosty but kindly let me go with you
	Ill do the service of a younger man
	In all your business and necessities

ORLANDO	O good old man how well in thee appears
	The constant service of the antique world
	When service sweat for duty not for meed
	Thou art not for the fashion of these times
	Where none will sweat but for promotion
	And having that do choke their service up
	Even with the having it is not so with thee
	But poor old man thou prunest a rotten tree
	That cannot so much as a blossom yield
	In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
	But come thy ways well go along together
	And ere we have thy youthful wages spent
	Well light upon some settled low content

ADAM	Master go on and I will follow thee
	To the last gasp with truth and loyalty
	From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
	Here lived I but now live here no more
	At seventeen years many their fortunes seek
	But at fourscore it is too late a week
	Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
	Than to die well and not my masters debtor

	Exeunt




	AS YOU LIKE IT


ACT II



SCENE IV	The Forest of Arden


	Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede CELIA for Aliena
	and TOUCHSTONE

ROSALIND	O Jupiter how weary are my spirits

TOUCHSTONE	I care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary

ROSALIND	I could find in my heart to disgrace my mans
	apparel and to cry like a woman but I must comfort
	the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show
	itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage
	good Aliena

CELIA	I pray you bear with me I cannot go no further

TOUCHSTONE	For my part I had rather bear with you than bear
	you yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you
	for I think you have no money in your purse

ROSALIND	Well this is the forest of Arden

TOUCHSTONE	Ay now am I in Arden the more fool I when I was
	at home I was in a better place but travellers
	must be content

ROSALIND	Ay be so good Touchstone

	Enter CORIN and SILVIUS

	Look you who comes here a young man and an old in
	solemn talk

CORIN	That is the way to make her scorn you still

SILVIUS	O Corin that thou knewst how I do love her

CORIN	I partly guess for I have loved ere now

SILVIUS	No Corin being old thou canst not guess
	Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
	As ever sighd upon a midnight pillow
	But if thy love were ever like to mine
	As sure I think did never man love so
	How many actions most ridiculous
	Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?

CORIN	Into a thousand that I have forgotten

SILVIUS	O thou didst then neer love so heartily
	If thou rememberst not the slightest folly
	That ever love did make thee run into
	Thou hast not loved
	Or if thou hast not sat as I do now
	Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress praise
	Thou hast not loved
	Or if thou hast not broke from company
	Abruptly as my passion now makes me
	Thou hast not loved
	O Phebe Phebe Phebe

	Exit

ROSALIND	Alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
	I have by hard adventure found mine own

TOUCHSTONE	And I mine I remember when I was in lRAI P KZTSG
