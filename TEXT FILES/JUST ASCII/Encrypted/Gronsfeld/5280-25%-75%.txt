To their night watches in warlike parade
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake
Uzziel half these draw off and coast the south
With strictest watch these other wheel the north
Our circuit meets full west  As flame they part
Half wheeling to the shield half to the spear
From these two strong and subtle Spirits he called
That near him stood and gave them thus in charge
Ithuriel and Zephon with winged speed
Search through this garden leave unsearched no nook
But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harm
This evening from the suns decline arrived
Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen
Hitherward bent who could have thought? escaped
The bars of Hell on errand bad no doubt
Such where ye find seise fast and hither bring
So saying on he led his radiant files
Dazzling the moon these to the bower direct
In search of whom they sought  Him there they found
Squat like a toad close at the ear of Eve
Assaying by his devilish art to reach
The organs of her fancy and with them forge
Illusions as he list phantasms and dreams
Or if inspiring venom he might taint
The animal spirits that from pure blood arise
Like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
At least distempered discontented thoughts
Vain hopes vain aims inordinate desires
Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride
Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear
Touched lightly for no falshood can endure
Touch of celestial temper but returns
Of force to its own likeness  Up he starts
Discovered and surprised  As when a spark
Lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid
Fit for the tun some magazine to store
Against a rumoured war the smutty grain
With sudden blaze diffused inflames the air
So started up in his own shape the Fiend
Back stept those two fair Angels half amazed
So sudden to behold the grisly king
Yet thus unmoved with fear accost him soon
Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell
Comest thou escaped thy prison? and transformed
Why satst thou like an enemy in wait
Here watching at the head of these that sleep?
Know ye not then said Satan filled with scorn
Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate
For you there sitting where ye durst not soar
Not to know me argues yourselves unknown
The lowest of your throng or if ye know
Why ask ye and superfluous begin
Your message like to end as much in vain?
To whom thus Zephon answering scorn with scorn
Think not revolted Spirit thy shape the same
Or undiminished brightness to be known
As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure
That glory then when thou no more wast good
Departed from thee and thou resemblest now
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul
But come for thou be sure shalt give account
To him who sent us whose charge is to keep
This place inviolable and these from harm
So spake the Cherub and his grave rebuke
Severe in youthful beauty added grace
Invincible  Abashed the Devil stood
And felt how awful goodness is and saw
Virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined
His loss but chiefly to find here observed
His lustre visibly impaired yet seemed
Undaunted  If I must contend said he
Best with the best the sender not the sent
Or all at once more glory will be won
Or less be lost  Thy fear said Zephon bold
Will save us trial what the least can do
Single against thee wicked and thence weak
The Fiend replied not overcome with rage
But like a proud steeL WMKNNL AHSX OJCLPVY XV
