bookmark puts it in his pocket and returns to work  The next day he
comes in and resumes where he left off  Interestingly this man had
never been in the library before he used AM  In another small rural
library the coordinator reports that AM is a popular activity for some
of the older retired people in the community who ordinarily would not
use "those things"computers  Another example of adult learning in
public libraries is book groups one of which in particular is using AM
as part of its reading on industrialization integration and urbanization
in the early s

One library reports that a family is using AM to help educate their
children  In another instance individuals from a local museum came in
to use AM to prepare an exhibit on toys of the past  These two examples
emphasize the mission of the public library as a cultural institution
reaching out to people who do not have the same resources available to
those who live in a metropolitan area or have access to a major library
One rural library reports that junior high school students in large
numbers came in one afternoon to use AM for entertainment  A number of
public libraries reported great interest among postcard collectors in the
Detroit collection which was essentially a collection of images used on
postcards around the turn of the century  Train buffs are similarly
interested because that was a time of great interest in railroading
People it was found relate to things that they know of firsthand  For
example in both rural public libraries where AM was made available
observers reported that the older people with personal remembrances of
the turn of the century were gravitating to the Detroit collection
These examples served to underscore MICHELSONs observation re the
integration of electronic tools and ideasthat people learn best when
the material relates to something they know

VECCIA made the final point that in many cases AM serves as a
publicrelations tool for the public libraries that are testing it  In
one case AM is being used as a vehicle to secure additional funding for
the library  In another case AM has served as an inspiration to the
staff of a major local public library in the South to think about ways to
make its own collection of photographs more accessible to the public

                                  


FREEMAN  AM and archival electronic resources in a school environment 
Questions concerning context  Questions concerning the electronic format
itself  Computer anxiety  Access and availability of the system 
Hardware  Strengths gained through the use of archival resources in
schools 


Reiterating an observation made by VECCIA that AM is an archival
resource made up of primary materials with very little interpretation
FREEMAN stated that the project has attempted to bridge the gap between
these bare primary materials and a school environment and in that cause
has created guided introductions to AM collections  Loud demand from the
educational community  chiefly from teachers working with the upper
grades of elementary school through high school greeted the announcement
that AM would be tested around the country

FREEMAN reported not only on what was learned about AM in a school
environment but also on several universal questions that were raised
concerning archival electronic resources in schools  She discussed
several strengths of this type of material in a school environment as
opposed to a highly structured resource that offers a limited number of
paths to follow

FREEMAN first raised several questions about using AM in a school
environment  There is often some difficulty in developing a sense of
what the system contains  Many students sit down at a computer resource
and assume that because AM comes from the Library of Congress all of
American history is now at their fingertips  As a result of that sort of
mistaken judgment some students are known to conclude that AM contains
nothing of use to them when they look for one or two things and do not
find them  It is difficult to discover that middle ground where one has
a sense of what the system contains  Some students grope toward the idea
of an archive a new idea to them since they have not previously
experienced what it means to have access to a vast body of somewhat
random information

Other questions raised by FREEMAN concerned the electronic format itself
For instance in a school environment it is often difficult both for
teachers and students to gain a sense of what it is they are viewing
They understand that it is a visual image but they do not necessarily
know that it is a postcard from the turn of the century a panoramic
photograph or even machinereadable text of an eighteenthcentury
broadside a twentiethcentury printed book or a nineteenthcentury
diary  That distinction is often difficult for people in a school
environment to grasp  Because of that it occasionally becomes difficult
to draw conclusions from what one is viewing

FREEMAN also noted the obvious fear of the computer which constitutes a
difficulty in using an electronic resource  Though students in general
did not suffer from this anxiety several older students feared that they
were computerilliterate an assumption that became selffulfilling when
they searched for something but failed to find it  FREEMAN said she
believed that some teachers also fear computer resources because they
believe they lack complete control  FREEMAN related the example of
teachers shooing away students because it was not their time to use the
system  This was a case in which the situation had to be extremely
structured so that the teachers would not feel that they had lost their
grasp on what the system contained

A final question raised by FREEMAN concerned access and availability of
the system  She noted the occasional existence of a gap in communication
between school librarians and teachers  Often AM sits in a school
library and the librarian is the person responsible for monitoring the
system  Teachers do not always take into their world new library
resources about which the librarian is excited  Indeed at the sites
where AM had been used most effectively within a library the librarian
was required to go to specific teachers and instruct them in its use  As
a result several AM sites will have inservice sessions over a summer
in the hope that perhaps with a more individualized link teachers will
be more likely to use the resource

A related issue in the school context concerned the number of
workstations available at any one location  Centralization of equipment
at the district level with teachers invited to download things and walk
away with them proved unsuccessful because the hours these offices were
open were also school hours

Another issue was hardware  As VECCIA observed a range of sites exists
some technologically advanced and others essentially acquiring their
first computer for the primary purpose of using it in conjunction with
AMs testing  Users at technologically sophisticated sites want even
more sophisticated hardware so that they can perform even more
sophisticated tasks with the materials in AM  But once they acquire a
newer piece of hardware they must learn how to use that also at an
unsophisticated site it takes an extremely long time simply to become
accustomed to the computer not to mention the program offered with the
computer  All of these small issues raise one large question namely
are systems like AM truly rewarding in a school environment or do they
simply act as innovative toys that do little more than spark interest?

FREEMAN contended that the evaluation project has revealed several strengths
that were gained through the use of archival resources in schools including

      Psychic rewards from using AM as a vast rich database with
     teachers assigning various projects to studentsoral presentations
     written reports a documentary a turnofthecentury newspaper
     projects that start with the materials in AM but are completed using
     other resources AM thus is used as a research tool in conjunction
     with other electronic resources as well as with books and items in
     the library where the system is set up

      Students are acquiring computer literacy in a humanities context

      This sort of system is overcoming the isolation between disciplines
     that often exists in schools  For example many English teachers are
     requiring their students to write papers on historical topics
     represented in AM  Numerous teachers have reported that their
     students are learning critical thinking skills using the system

      On a broader level AM is introducing primary materials not only
     to students but also to teachers in an environment where often
     simply none existan exciting thing for the students because it
     helps them learn to conduct research to interpret and to draw
     their own conclusions  In learning to conduct research and what it
     means students are motivated to seek knowledge  That relates to
     another positive outcomea high level of personal involvement of
     students with the materials in this system and greater motivation to
     conduct their own research and draw their own conclusions

      Perhaps the most ironic strength of these kinds of archival
     electronic resources is that many of the teachers AM interviewed
     were desperate it is no exaggeration to say not only for primary
     materials but for unstructured primary materials  These would they
     thought foster personally motivated research exploration and
     excitement in their students  Indeed these materials have done
     just that  Ironically however this lack of structure produces
     some of the confusion to which the newness of these kinds of
     resources may also contribute  The key to effective use of archival
     products in a school environment is a clear effective introduction
     to the system and to what it contains

                                 


DISCUSSION  Nothing known quantitatively about the number of
humanities scholars who must see the original versus those who would
settle for an edited transcript or about the ways in which humanities
scholars are using information technology  Firm conclusions concerning
the manner and extent of the use of supporting materials in print
provided by AM to await completion of evaluative study  A listeners
reflections on additional applications of electronic texts  Role of
electronic resources in teaching elementary research skills to students 


During the discussion that followed the presentations by MICHELSON
VECCIA and FREEMAN additional points emerged

LESK asked if MICHELSON could give any quantitative estimate of the
number of humanities scholars who must see or want to see the original
or the best possible version of the material versus those who typically
would settle for an edited transcript  While unable to provide a figure
she offered her impressions as an archivist who has done some reference
work and has discussed this issue with other archivists who perform
reference that those who use archives and those who use primary sources
for what would be considered very highlevel scholarly research as
opposed to say undergraduate papers were few in number especially
given the public interest in using primary sources to conduct
genealogical or avocational research and the kind of professional
research done by people in private industry or the federal government
More important in MICHELSONs view was that quantitatively nothing is
known about the ways in which for example humanities scholars are using
information technology  No studies exist to offer guidance in creating
strategies  The most recent study was conducted in  by the American
Council of Learned Societies ACLS and what it showed was that 
percent of humanities scholars at that time were using computers  That
constitutes the extent of our knowledge

Concerning AMs strategy for orienting people toward the scope of
electronic resources FREEMAN could offer no hard conclusions at this
point because she and her colleagues were still waiting to see
particularly in the schools what has been made of their efforts  Within
the system however AM has provided what are called electronic exhibits
such as introductions to time periods and materialsand these are
intended to offer a student user a sense of what a broadside is  and what
it might tell her or him  But FREEMAN conceded that the project staff
would have to talk with students next year after teachers have had a
summer to use the materials and attempt to discover what the students
were learning from the materials  In addition FREEMAN described
supporting materials in print provided by AM at the request of local
teachers during a meeting held at LC  These included time lines
bibliographies and other materials that could be reproduced on a
photocopier in a classroom  Teachers could walk away with and use these
and in this way gain a better understanding of the contents  But again
reaching firm conclusions concerning the manner and extent of their use
would have to wait until next year

As to the changes she saw occurring at the National Archives and Records
Administration NARA as a result of the increasing emphasis on
technology in scholarly research MICHELSON stated that NARA at this
point was absorbing the report by her and Jeff Rothenberg addressing
strategies for the archival profession in general although not for the
National Archives specifically  NARA is just beginning to establish its
role and what it can do  In terms of changes and initiatives that NARA
can take no clear response could be given at this time
