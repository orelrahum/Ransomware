So spake the Cherub and his grave rebuke
Severe in youthful beauty added grace
Invincible  Abashed the Devil stood
And felt how awful goodness is and saw
Virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined
His loss but chiefly to find here observed
His lustre visibly impaired yet seemed
Undaunted  If I must contend said he
Best with the best the sender not the sent
Or all at once more glory will be won
Or less be lost  Thy fear said Zephon bold
Will save us trial what the least can do
Single against thee wicked and thence weak
The Fiend replied not overcome with rage
But like a proud steed reined went haughty on
Champing his iron curb  To strive or fly
He held it vain awe from above had quelled
His heart not else dismayed  Now drew they nigh
The western point where those halfrounding guards
Just met and closing stood in squadron joined
A waiting next command  To whom their Chief
Gabriel from the front thus called aloud
O friends  I hear the tread of nimble feet
Hasting this way and now by glimpse discern
Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade
And with them comes a third of regal port
But faded splendour wan who by his gait
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell
Not likely to part hence without contest
Stand firm for in his look defiance lours
He scarce had ended when those two approached
And brief related whom they brought where found
How busied in what form and posture couched
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake
Why hast thou Satan broke the bounds prescribed
To thy transgressions and disturbed the charge
Of others who approve not to transgress
By thy example but have power and right
To question thy bold entrance on this place
Employed it seems to violate sleep and those
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss
To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow
Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise
And such I held thee but this question asked
Puts me in doubt  Lives there who loves his pain
Who would not finding way break loose from Hell
Though thither doomed  Thou wouldst thyself no doubt
And boldly venture to whatever place
Farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
Torment with ease and soonest recompense
Dole with delight which in this place I sought
To thee no reason who knowest only good
But evil hast not tried and wilt object
His will who bounds us  Let him surer bar
His iron gates if he intends our stay
In that dark durance  Thus much what was asked
The rest is true they found me where they say
But that implies not violence or harm
Thus he in scorn  The warlike Angel moved
Disdainfully half smiling thus replied
O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise
Since Satan fell whom folly overthrew
And now returns him from his prison scaped
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
Or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed
So wise he judges it to fly from pain
However and to scape his punishment
So judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath
Which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight
Sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to Hell
Which taught thee yet no better that no pain
Can equal anger infinite provoked
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they
Less hardy to endure?  Courageous Chief
The first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged
To thy deserted host this cause of flight
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive
To which the Fiend thus answered frowning stern
Not that I less endure or shrink from pain
Insulting Angel well thou knowest I stood
Thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid
The blasting vollied thunder made all speed
And seconded thy else not dreaded spear
But still thy words at random as before
Argue thy inexperience what behoves
From hard assays and ill successes past
A faithful leader not to hazard all
Through ways of danger by himself untried
I therefore I alone first undertook
To wing the desolate abyss and spy
This new created world whereof in Hell
Fame is not silent here in hope to find
Better abode and my afflicted Powers
To settle here on earth or in mid air
Though for possession put to try once more
What thou and thy gay legions dare against
Whose easier business were to serve their Lord
High up in Heaven with songs to hymn his throne
And practised distances to cringe not fight
To whom the warriour Angel soon replied
To say and straight unsay pretending first
Wise to fly pain professing next the spy
Argues no leader but a liear traced
Satan and couldst thou faithful add?  O name
O sacred name of faithfulness profaned
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
Army of Fiends fit body to fit head
Was this your discipline and faith engaged
Your military obedience to dissolve
Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?
And thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
Patron of liberty who more than thou
Once fawned and cringed and servily adored
Heavens awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope
To dispossess him and thyself to reign?
But mark what I arreed thee now Avant
Fly neither whence thou fledst  If from this hour
Within these hallowed limits thou appear
Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained
And seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn
The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred
So threatened he but Satan to no threats
Gave heed but waxing more in rage replied
Then when I am thy captive talk of chains
Proud limitary Cherub but ere then
Far heavier load thyself expect to feel
From my prevailing arm though Heavens King
Ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers
Usd to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels
In progress through the road of Heaven starpaved
While thus he spake the angelick squadron bright
Turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns
Their phalanx and began to hem him round
With ported spears as thick as when a field
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
Her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
Sways them the careful plowman doubting stands
Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
Prove chaff  On the other side Satan alarmed
Collecting all his might dilated stood
Like Teneriff or Atlas unremoved
His stature reached the sky and on his crest
Sat Horrour plumed nor wanted in his grasp
What seemed both spear and shield  Now dreadful deeds
Might have ensued nor only Paradise
In this commotion but the starry cope
Of Heaven perhaps or all the elements
At least had gone to wrack disturbed and torn
With violence of this conflict had not soon
The Eternal to prevent such horrid fray
Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales yet seen
Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign
Wherein all things created first he weighed
The pendulous round earth with balanced air
In counterpoise now ponders all events
Battles and realms  In these he put two weights
The sequel each of parting and of fight
The latter quick up flew and kicked the beam
Which Gabriel spying thus bespake the Fiend
Satan I know thy strength and thou knowest mine
Neither our own but given  What folly then
To boast what arms can do? since thine no more
Than Heaven permits nor mine though doubled now
To trample thee as mire  For proof look up
And read thy lot in yon celestial sign
Where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak
If thou resist  The Fiend looked up and knew
His mounted scale aloft  Nor morebut fled
Murmuring and with him fled the shades of night



Book V


Now Morn her rosy steps in the eastern clime
Advancing sowed the earth with orient pearl
When Adam waked so customed for his sleep
Was aerylight from pure digestion bred
And temperate vapours bland which the only sound
Of leaves and fuming rills Auroras fan
Lightly dispersed and the shrill matin song
Of birds on every bough so much the more
His wonder was to find unwakened Eve
With tresses discomposed and glowing cheek
As through unquiet rest  He on his side
Leaning half raised with looks of cordial love
Hung over her enamoured and beheld
Beauty which whether waking or asleep
Shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes
Her hand soft touching whispered thus  Awake
My fairest my espoused my latest found
Heavens last best gift my ever new delight
Awake  The morning shines and the fresh field
Calls us we lose the prime to mark how spring
Our tender plants how blows the citron grove
What drops the myrrh and what the balmy reed
How nature paints her colours how the bee
Sits on the bloom extracting liquid sweet
Such whispering waked her but with startled eye
On Adam whom embracing thus she spake
O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose
My glory my perfection glad I see
Thy face and morn returned for I this night
Such night till this I never passed have dreamed
If dreamed not as I oft am wont of thee
Works of day past or morrows next design
But of offence and trouble which my mind
Knew never till this irksome night  Methought
Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk
With gentle voice  I thought it thine It said
Why sleepest thou Eve? now is the pleasant time
The cool the silent saAM YHNZI VNPLWKJ GKEULW
