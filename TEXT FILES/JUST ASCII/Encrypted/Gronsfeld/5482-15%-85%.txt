Mongolia Economy

Overview
    Mongolias severe climate scattered population and wide expanses of
    unproductive land have constrained economic development Economic activity
    traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock 
    Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world In
    recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet
    support The mining and processing of coal copper molybdenum tin
    tungsten and gold account for a large part of industrial production Timber
    and fishing are also important sectors In  Mongolian leadership is
    struggling with severe economic dislocations mainly attributable to the
    economic crumbling of the USSR by far Mongolias leading trade and
    development partner Moscow almost certainly cut aid in  and the
    dissolution of the USSR at yearend  makes prospects for aid quite bleak
    for  Industry in  has been hit hard by energy shortages mainly
    due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports
    The government is moving away from the Sovietstyle centrally planned
    economy through privatization and price reform

Morocco Economy

Overview
    The economy had recovered moderately in  because of the resolution of a
    trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales a rebound in textile
    sales to the EC lower prices for food imports a sharp increase in worker
    remittances increased Arab donor aid and generous debt rescheduling
    agreements Economic performance in  was mixed A record harvest helped
    real GDP advance by  although nonagricultural output grew by less than
     Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial policies triggered
    rapid credit and monetary growth Despite recovery of domestic demand
    import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely affected by
    phosphate marketing difficulties In January  Morocco reached a new
    month standby arrangement for  million with the IMF In February
     the Paris Club rescheduled  billion of Moroccos commercial debt
    This is thought to be Moroccos last rescheduling By  the Moroccan
    authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service obligations
    without additional rescheduling Servicing this large debt high

Mozambique Economy

Overview
    One of Africas poorest countries Mozambique has failed to exploit the
    economic potential of its sizable agricultural hydropower and
    transportation resources Indeed national output consumption and
    investment declined throughout the first half of the s because of
    internal disorders lack of government administrative control and a growing
    foreign debt A sharp increase in foreign aid attracted by an economic
    reform policy has resulted in successive years of economic growth since
     Agricultural output nevertheless is at about only  of its 
    level and grain has to be imported Industry operates at only  of
    capacity The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat
