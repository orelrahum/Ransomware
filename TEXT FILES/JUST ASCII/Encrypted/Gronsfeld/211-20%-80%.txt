Latvia Economy

Overview
    Latvia is in the process of reforming the centrally planned economy
    inherited from the former USSR into a market economy Prices have been
    freed and privatization of shops and farms has begun Latvia lacks natural
    resources aside from its arable land and small forests Its most valuable
    economic asset is its work force which is better educated and disciplined
    than in most of the former Soviet republics Industrial production is highly
    diversified with products ranging from agricultural machinery to consumer
    electronics One conspicuous vulnerability Latvia produces only  of its
    electric power needs Latvia in the near term must retain key commercial
    ties to Russia Belarus and Ukraine while moving in the long run toward
    joint ventures technological support and trade ties to the West Because
    of the efficiency of its mostly individual farms Latvians enjoy a diet that
    is higher in meat vegetables and dairy products and lower in grain and
    potatoes than diets in the  nonBaltic republics of the USSR Good
    relations with Russia are threatened by animosity between ethnic Russians

Lebanon Government

Note
    Between early  and late  Lebanon was torn by civil war between its
    Christians  then aided by Syrian troops  and its Muslims and their
    Palestinian allies The ceasefire established in October  between the
    domestic political groups generally held for about six years despite
    occasional fighting Syrian troops constituted as the Arab Deterrent Force
    by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon Syrias move toward supporting
    the Lebanese Muslims and the Palestinians and Israels growing support for
    Lebanese Christians brought the two sides into rough equilibrium but no
    progress was made toward national reconciliation or political reforms  the
    original cause of the war Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian
    presence in Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 
    Israeli forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and
    mounted a summerlong siege of Beirut which resulted in the evacuation of
    the PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational
    force MNF made up of US French and Italian troops Within days of the
    departure of the MNF Lebanons newly elected president Bashir Gemayel was
    assassinated his elder brother Amin was elected to succeed him In the
    immediate wake of Bashirs death however Christian militiamen massacred
    hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two Beirut camps This prompted the
    return of the MNF to ease the security burden on Lebanons weak Army and
    security forces In late March  the last MNF units withdrew In 
    President Gemayel completed his term of office Because parliamentarians
    failed to elect a presidential successor Gemayel appointed then Lebanese
    Armed Forces LAF Commander Gen Michel Awn acting president Lebanese
    parliamentarians met in Taif Saudi Arabia in late  and concluded a
    national reconciliation pact that codified a new powersharing formula
    specifying reduced powers for the Christian president and giving Muslims
    more authority Rene MUAWAD was subsequently elected president on  November
     ending a month period during which Lebanon had no president and
    rival Muslim and Christian governments MUAWAD was assassinated  days
    later on  November on  November Ilyas Harawi was elected to succeed
    MUAWAD In October  the civil war was apparently brought to a
    conclusion when Syrian and Lebanese forces ousted renegade Christian General
    Awn from his stronghold in East Beirut Awn had defied the legitimate
    government and established a separate ministate within East Beirut after
    being appointed acting Prime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in 
    Awn and his supporters feared Taif would diminish Christian power in
    Lebanon and increase the influence of Syria Awn was granted amnesty and
    allowed to travel in France in August l Since the removal of Awn the
    Lebanese Government has made substantial progress in strengthening the
    central government rebuilding government institutions and extending its
    authority throughout the nation The LAF has deployed from Beirut north
    along the coast road to Tripoli southeast into the Shuf mountains and
    south to Sidon and Tyre Many militiamen from Christian and Muslim groups
    have evacuated Beirut for their strongholds in the north south and east of
    the country Some heavy weapons possessed by the militias have been turned
    over to the government or sold outside the country which has begun a plan
    to integrate some militiamen into the military and the internal security
    forces Lebanon and Syria signed a treaty of friendship and cooperation in
    May  Lebanon continues to be partially occupied by Syrian troops which
    are deployed in Beirut its southern suburbs the Bekaa Valley and northern
    Lebanon Iran also maintains a small contingent of revolutionary guards in
    the Bekaa Valley to support Lebanese Islamic fundamentalist groups Israel
    withdrew the bulk of its forces from the south in  although it still
    retains troops in a kmdeep security zone north of its border with
    Lebanon Israel arms and trains the Army of South Lebanon ASL which also
    occupies the security zone and is Israels first line of defense against
    attacks on its northern border The following description is based on the
    present constitutional and customary practices of the Lebanese system

Lebanon Economy

Overview
    Since  civil war has seriously damaged Lebanons economic
    infrastructure cut national output by half and all but ended Lebanons
    position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub Following October
     however a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin
    restoring control in Beirut collect taxes and regain access to key port
    and government facilities The battered economy has also been propped up by
    a financially sound banking system and resilient small and mediumscale
    manufacturers Family remittances banking transactions manufactured and
    farm exports the narcotics trade and international emergency aid are main
    sources of foreign exchange In the relatively settled year of 
    industrial production agricultural output and exports showed substantial
    gains The further rebuilding of the warravaged country could provide a
    major stimulus to the economy in  provided that the political and
    military situation remains reasonably calm
