opposed to say undergraduate papers were few in number especially
given the public interest in using primary sources to conduct
genealogical or avocational research and the kind of professional
research done by people in private industry or the federal government
More important in MICHELSONs view was that quantitatively nothing is
known about the ways in which for example humanities scholars are using
information technology  No studies exist to offer guidance in creating
strategies  The most recent study was conducted in  by the American
Council of Learned Societies ACLS and what it showed was that 
percent of humanities scholars at that time were using computers  That
constitutes the extent of our knowledge

Concerning AMs strategy for orienting people toward the scope of
electronic resources FREEMAN could offer no hard conclusions at this
point because she and her colleagues were still waiting to see
particularly in the schools what has been made of their efforts  Within
the system however AM has provided what are called electronic exhibits
such as introductions to time periods and materialsand these are
intended to offer a student user a sense of what a broadside is  and what
it might tell her or him  But FREEMAN conceded that the project staff
would have to talk with students next year after teachers have had a
summer to use the materials and attempt to discover what the students
were learning from the materials  In addition FREEMAN described
supporting materials in print provided by AM at the request of local
teachers during a meeting held at LC  These included time lines
bibliographies and other materials that could be reproduced on a
photocopier in a classroom  Teachers could walk away with and use these
and in this way gain a better understanding of the contents  But again
reaching firm conclusions concerning the manner and extent of their use
would have to wait until next year

As to the changes she saw occurring at the National Archives and Records
Administration NARA as a result of the increasing emphasis on
technology in scholarly research MICHELSON stated that NARA at this
point was absorbing the report by her and Jeff Rothenberg addressing
strategies for the archival profession in general although not for the
National Archives specifically  NARA is just beginning to establish its
role and what it can do  In terms of changes and initiatives that NARA
can take no clear response could be given at this time

GREENFIELD remarked two trends mentioned in the session  Reflecting on
DALYs opening comments on how he could have used a Latin collection of
text in an electronic form he said that at first he thought most scholars
would be unwilling to do that  But as he thought of that in terms of the
original meaning of researchthat is having already mastered these texts
researching them for critical and comparative purposesfor the first time
the electronic format made a lot of sense  GREENFIELD could envision
growing numbers of scholars learning the new technologies for that very
aspect of their scholarship and for conveniences sake

Listening to VECCIA and FREEMAN GREENFIELD thought of an additional
application of electronic texts  He realized that AM could be used as a
guide to lead someone to original sources  Students cannot be expected
to have mastered these sources things they have never known about
before  Thus AM is leading them in theory to a vast body of
information and giving them a superficial overview of it enabling them
to select parts of it  GREENFIELD asked if any evidence exists that this
resource will indeed teach the new user the K students how to do
research  Scholars already know how to do research and are applying
these new tools  But he wondered why students would go beyond picking
out things that were most exciting to them

FREEMAN conceded the correctness of GREENFIELDs observation as applied
to a school environment  The risk is that a student would sit down at a
system play with it find some things of interest and then walk away
But in the relatively controlled situation of a school library much will
depend on the instructions a teacher or a librarian gives a student  She
viewed the situation not as one of finetuning research skills but of
involving students at a personal level in understanding and researching
things  Given the guidance one can receive at school it then becomes
possible to teach elementary research skills to students which in fact
one particular librarian said she was teaching her fifth graders
FREEMAN concluded that introducing the idea of following ones own path
of inquiry which is essentially what research entails involves more
than teaching specific skills  To these comments VECCIA added the
observation that the individual teacher and the use of a creative
resource rather than AM itself seemed to make the key difference
Some schools and some teachers are making excellent use of the nature
of critical thinking and teaching skills she said

Concurring with these remarks DALY closed the session with the thought that
the more that producers produced for teachers and for scholars to use with
their students the more successful their electronic products would prove

                                 

SESSION II  SHOW AND TELL

Jacqueline HESS director National Demonstration Laboratory served as
moderator of the "showandtell" session  She noted that a
questionandanswer period would follow each presentation


MYLONAS  Overview and content of Perseus  Perseus primary materials
exist in a systemindependent archival form  A concession  Textual
aspects of Perseus  Tools to use with the Greek text  Prepared indices
and fulltext searches in Perseus  EnglishGreek word search leads to
close study of words and concepts  Navigating Perseus by tracing down
indices  Using the iconography to perform research 


Elli MYLONAS managing editor Perseus Project Harvard University first
gave an overview of Perseus a large collaborative effort based at
Harvard University but with contributors and collaborators located at
numerous universities and colleges in the United States eg Bowdoin
Maryland Pomona Chicago Virginia  Funded primarily by the
AnnenbergCPB Project with additional funding from Apple Harvard and
the Packard Humanities Institute among others Perseus is a multimedia
hypertextual database for teaching and research on classical Greek
civilization which was released in February  in version  and
distributed by Yale University Press

Consisting entirely of primary materials Perseus includes ancient Greek
texts and translations of those texts catalog entriesthat is museum
catalog entries not library catalog entrieson vases sites coins
sculpture and archaeological objects maps and a dictionary among
other sources  The number of objects and the objects for which catalog
entries exist are accompanied by thousands of color images which
constitute a major feature of the database  Perseus contains
approximately  megabytes of text an amount that will double in
subsequent versions  In addition to these primary materials the Perseus
Project has been building tools for using them making access and
navigation easier the goal being to build part of the electronic
environment discussed earlier in the morning in which students or
scholars can work with their sources

The demonstration of Perseus will show only a fraction of the real work
that has gone into it because the project had to face the dilemma of
what to enter when putting something into machinereadable form  should
one aim for very high quality or make concessions in order to get the
material in?  Since Perseus decided to opt for very high quality all of
its primary materials exist in a systemindependentinsofar as it is
possible to be systemindependentarchival form  Deciding what that
archival form would be and attaining it required much work and thought
For example all the texts are marked up in SGML which will be made
compatible with the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative TEI when
they are issued

Drawings are postscript files not meeting international standards but
at least designed to go across platforms  Images or rather the real
archival forms consist of the best available slides which are being
digitized  Much of the catalog material exists in database forma form
that the average user could use manipulate and display on a personal
computer but only at great cost  Thus this is where the concession
comes in  All of this rich wellmarkedup information is stripped of
much of its content the images are converted into bitmaps and the text
into small formatted chunks  All this information can then be imported
into HyperCard and run on a midrange Macintosh which is what Perseus
users have  This fact has made it possible for Perseus to attain wide
use fairly rapidly  Without those archival forms the HyperCard version
being demonstrated could not be made easily and the project could not
have the potential to move to other forms and machines and software as
they appear none of which information is in Perseus on the CD

Of the numerous multimedia aspects of Perseus MYLONAS focused on the
textual  Part of what makes Perseus such a pleasure to use MYLONAS
said is this effort at seamless integration and the ability to move
around both visual and textual material  Perseus also made the decision
not to attempt to interpret its material any more than one interprets by
selecting  But MYLONAS emphasized Perseus is not courseware  No
syllabus exists  There is no effort to define how one teaches a topic
using Perseus although the project may eventually collect papers by
people who have used it to teach  Rather Perseus aims to provide
primary material in a kind of electronic library an electronic sandbox
so to say in which students and scholars who are working on this
material can explore by themselves  With that MYLONAS demonstrated
Perseus beginning with the Perseus gateway the first thing one sees
upon opening Perseusan effort in part to solve the contextualizing
problemwhich tells the user what the system contains

MYLONAS demonstrated only a very small portion beginning with primary
texts and running off the CDROM  Having selected Aeschylus Prometheus
Bound which was viewable in Greek and English pretty much in the same
segments together MYLONAS demonstrated tools to use with the Greek text
something not possible with a book  looking up the dictionary entry form
of an unfamiliar word in Greek after subjecting it to Perseus
morphological analysis for all the texts  After finding out about a
word a user may then decide to see if it is used anywhere else in Greek
Because vast amounts of indexing support all of the primary material one
can find out where else all forms of a particular Greek word appear
often not a trivial matter because Greek is highly inflected  Further
since the story of Prometheus has to do with the origins of sacrifice a
user may wish to study and explore sacrifice in Greek literature by
typing sacrifice into a small window a user goes to the EnglishGreek
word listsomething one cannot do without the computer Perseus has
indexed the definitions of its dictionarythe string sacrifice appears
in the definitions of these sixtyfive words  One may then find out
where any of those words is used in the works of a particular author
The English definitions are not lemmatized

All of the indices driving this kind of usage were originally devised for
speed MYLONAS observed in other words all that kind of information
all forms of all words where they exist the dictionary form they belong
towere collected into databases which will expedite searching  Then
it was discovered that one can do things searching in these databases
that could not be done searching in the full texts  Thus although there
are fulltext searches in Perseus much of the work is done behind the
scenes using prepared indices  Re the indexing that is done behind the
scenes MYLONAS pointed out that without the SGML forms of the text it
could not be done effectively  Much of this indexing is based on the
structures that are made explicit by the SGML tagging

It was found that one of the things many of Perseus nonGreekreading
users do is start from the dictionary and then move into the close study
of words and concepts via this kind of EnglishGreek word search by which
means they might select a concept  This exercise has been assigned to
students in core courses at Harvardto study a concept by looking for the
English word in the dictionary finding the Greek words and then finding
the words in the Greek but of course reading across in the English
That tells them a great deal about what a translation means as well

Should one also wish to see images that have to do with sacrifice that
person would go to the object key word search which allows one to
perform a similar kind of index retrieval on the database of
archaeological objects  Without words pictures are useless Perseus has
not reached the point where it can do much with images that are not
cataloged  Thus although it is possible in Perseus with text and images
to navigate by knowing where one wants to end upfor example a
redfigure vase from the Boston Museum of Fine Artsone can perform this
kind of navigation very easily by tracing down indices  MYLONAS
illustrated several generic scenes of sacrifice on vases  The features
demonstrated derived from Perseus  version  will implement even
better means of retrieval

MYLONAS closed by looking at one of the pictures and noting again that
one can do a great deal of research using the iconography as well as the
texts  For instance students in a core course at Harvard this year were
highly interested in Greek concepts of foreigners and representations of
nonGreeks  So they performed a great deal of research both with texts
eg Herodotus and with iconography on vases and coins on how the
Greeks portrayed nonGreeks  At the same time art historians who study
iconography were also interested and were able to use this material

                                 


DISCUSSION  Indexing and searchability of all English words in Perseus 
Several features of Perseus   Several levels of customization
possible  Perseus used for general education  Perseus effects on
education  Contextual information in Perseus  Main challenge and
emphasis of Perseus 


Several points emerged in the discussion that followed MYLONASs presentation

Although MYLONAS had not demonstrated Perseus ability to crosssearch
documents she confirmed that all English words in Perseus are indexed
and can be searched  So for example sacrifice could have been searched
in all texts the historical essay and all the catalogue entries with
their descriptionsin short in all of Perseus

Boolean logic is not in Perseus  but will be added to the next
version although an effort is being made not to restrict Perseus to a
database in which one just performs searching Boolean or otherwise  It
is possible to move laterally through the documents by selecting a word
one is interested in and selecting an area of information one is
interested in and trying to look that word up in that area

Since Perseus was developed in HyperCard several levels of customization
are possible  Simple authoring tools exist that allow one to create
annotated paths through the information which are useful for notetFSKNP
