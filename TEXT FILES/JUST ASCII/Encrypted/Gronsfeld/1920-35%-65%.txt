	may be chosen out of the gross band of the
	unfaithful therefore beware my censure and keep
	your promise

ORLANDO	With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
	Rosalind so adieu

ROSALIND	Well Time is the old justice that examines all such
	offenders and let Time try adieu

	Exit ORLANDO

CELIA	You have simply misused our sex in your loveprate
	we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
	head and show the world what the bird hath done to
	her own nest

ROSALIND	O coz coz coz my pretty little coz that thou
	didst know how many fathom deep I am in love But
	it cannot be sounded my affection hath an unknown
	bottom like the bay of Portugal

CELIA	Or rather bottomless that as fast as you pour
	affection in it runs out

ROSALIND	No that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
	of thought conceived of spleen and born of madness
	that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes
	because his own are out let him be judge how deep I
	am in love Ill tell thee Aliena I cannot be out
	of the sight of Orlando Ill go find a shadow and
	sigh till he come

CELIA	And Ill sleep

	Exeunt

ACT IV



SCENE III	The forest


	Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

ROSALIND	How say you now? Is it not past two oclock? and
	here much Orlando

CELIA	I warrant you with pure love and troubled brain he
	hath taen his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
	sleep Look who comes here

	Enter SILVIUS

SILVIUS	My errand is to you fair youth
	My gentle Phebe bid me give you this
	I know not the contents but as I guess
	By the stern brow and waspish action
	Which she did use as she was writing of it
	It bears an angry tenor pardon me
	I am but as a guiltless messenger

ROSALIND	Patience herself would startle at this letter
	And play the swaggerer bear this bear all
	She says I am not fair that I lack manners
	She calls me proud and that she could not love me
	Were man as rare as phoenix Ods my will
	Her love is not the hare that I do hunt
	Why writes she so to me? Well shepherd well
	This is a letter of your own device

SILVIUS	No I protest I know not the contents
	Phebe did write it

ROSALIND	Come come you are a fool
	And turnd into the extremity of love
	I saw her hand she has a leathern hand
	A freestonecolourd hand I verily did think
	That her old gloves were on but twas her hands
	She has a huswifes hand but thats no matter
	I say she never did invent this letter
	This is a mans invention and his hand

SILVIUS	Sure it is hers

ROSALIND	Why tis a boisterous and a cruel style
	A style forchallengers why she defies me
	Like Turk to Christian womens gentle brain
	Could not drop forth such giantrude invention
	Such Ethiope words blacker in their effect
	Than in their countenance Will you hear the letter?

SILVIUS	So please you for I never heard it yet
	Yet heard too much of Phebes cruelty

ROSALIND	She Phebes me mark how the tyrant writes

	Reads

	Art thou god to shepherd turnd
	That a maidens heart hath burnd?
	Can a woman rail thus?

SILVIUS	Call you this railing?

ROSALIND	Reads

	Why thy godhead laid apart
	Warrst thou with a womans heart?
	Did you ever hear such railing?
	Whiles the eye of man did woo me
	That could do no vengeance to me
	Meaning me a beast
	If the scorn of your bright eyne
	Have power to raise such love in mine
	Alack in me what strange effect
	Would they work in mild aspect
	Whiles you chid me I did love
	How then might your prayers move
	He that brings this love to thee
	Little knows this love in me
	And by him seal up thy mind
	Whether that thy youth and kind
	Will the faithful offer take
	Of me and all that I can make
	Or else by him my love deny
	And then Ill study how to die

SILVIUS	Call you this chiding?

CELIA	Alas poor shepherd

ROSALIND	Do you pity him? no he deserves no pity Wilt
	thou love such a woman? What to make thee an
	instrument and play false strains upon thee not to
	be endured Well go your way to her for I see
	love hath made thee a tame snake and say this to
	her that if she love me I charge her to love
	thee if she will not I will never have her unless
	thou entreat for her If you be a true lover
	hence and not a word for here comes more company

	Exit SILVIUS

	Enter OLIVER

OLIVER	Good morrow fair ones pray you if you know
	Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
	A sheepcote fenced about with olive trees?

CELIA	West of this place down in the neighbour bottom
	The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
	Left on your right hand brings you to the place
