	loved no sooner loved but they sighed no sooner
	sighed but they asked one another the reason no

	to marriage which they will climb incontinent or
	else be incontinent before marriage they are in
	the very wrath of love and they will together clubs
	cannot part them

ORLANDO	They shall be married tomorrow and I will bid the
