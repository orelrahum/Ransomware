ACT II



SCENE IV	The Forest of Arden


	Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede CELIA for Aliena
	and TOUCHSTONE

ROSALIND	O Jupiter how weary are my spirits

TOUCHSTONE	I care not for my spirits if my legs were not weary

ROSALIND	I could find in my heart to disgrace my mans
	apparel and to cry like a woman but I must comfort
	the weaker vessel as doublet and hose ought to show
	itself courageous to petticoat therefore courage
	good Aliena

CELIA	I pray you bear with me I cannot go no further

TOUCHSTONE	For my part I had rather bear with you than bear
	you yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you
	for I think you have no money in your purse

ROSALIND	Well this is the forest of Arden

TOUCHSTONE	Ay now am I in Arden the more fool I when I was
	at home I was in a better place but travellers
	must be content

ROSALIND	Ay be so good Touchstone

	Enter CORIN and SILVIUS

	Look you who comes here a young man and an old in
	solemn talk

CORIN	That is the way to make her scorn you still

SILVIUS	O Corin that thou knewst how I do love her

CORIN	I partly guess for I have loved ere now

SILVIUS	No Corin being old thou canst not guess
	Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
	As ever sighd upon a midnight pillow
	But if thy love were ever like to mine
	As sure I think did never man love so
	How many actions most ridiculous
	Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?

CORIN	Into a thousand that I have forgotten

SILVIUS	O thou didst then neer love so heartily
	If thou rememberst not the slightest folly
	That ever love did make thee run into
	Thou hast not loved
	Or if thou hast not sat as I do now
	Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress praise
	Thou hast not loved
	Or if thou hast not broke from company
	Abruptly as my passion now makes me
	Thou hast not loved
	O Phebe Phebe Phebe

	Exit

ROSALIND	Alas poor shepherd searching of thy wound
	I have by hard adventure found mine own

TOUCHSTONE	And I mine I remember when I was in love I broke
	my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
	coming anight to Jane Smile and I remember the
	kissing of her batlet and the cows dugs that her
	pretty chopt hands had milked and I remember the
	wooing of a peascod instead of her from whom I took
	two cods and giving her them again said with
	weeping tears Wear these for my sake We that are
	true lovers run into strange capers but as all is
	mortal in nature so is all nature in love mortal in folly

ROSALIND	Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of

TOUCHSTONE	Nay I shall neer be ware of mine own wit till I
	break my shins against it

ROSALIND	Jove Jove this shepherds passion
	Is much upon my fashion

TOUCHSTONE	And mine but it grows something stale with me

CELIA	I pray you one of you question yond man
	If he for gold will give us any food
	I faint almost to death

TOUCHSTONE	Holla you clown

ROSALIND	Peace fool hes not thy kinsman

CORIN	Who calls?

TOUCHSTONE	Your betters sir

CORIN	                  Else are they very wretched

ROSALIND	Peace I say Good even to you friend

CORIN	And to you gentle sir and to you all

ROSALIND	I prithee shepherd if that love or gold
	Can in this desert place buy entertainment
	Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed
	Heres a young maid with travel much oppressd
	And faints for succor

CORIN	Fair sir I pity her
	And wish for her sake more than for mine own
	My fortunes were more able to relieve her
	But I am shepherd to another man
	And do not shear the fleeces that I graze
	My master is of churlish disposition
	And little recks to find the way to heaven
	By doing deeds of hospitality
	Besides his cote his flocks and bounds of feed
	Are now on sale and at our sheepcote now
	By reason of his absence there is nothing
	That you will feed on but what is come see
	And in my voice most welcome shall you be

ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?

CORIN	That young swain that you saw here but erewhile
	That little cares for buying any thing

ROSALIND	I pray thee if it stand with honesty
	Buy thou the cottage pasture and the flock
	And thou shalt have to pay for it of us

CELIA	And we will mend thy wages I like this place
	And willingly could waste my time in it

CORIN	Assuredly the thing is to be sold
	Go with me if you like upon report
	The soil the profit and this kind of life
	I will your very faithful feeder be
	And buy it with your gold right suddenly

	Exeunt

SCENE V	The Forest


	Enter AMIENS JAQUES and others

	SONG
AMIENS	Under the greenwood tree
	Who loves to lie with me
	And turn his merry note
	Unto the sweet birds throat
	Come hither come hither come hither
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather

JAQUES	More more I prithee more

AMIENS	It will make you melancholy Monsieur Jaques

JAQUES	I thank it More I prithee more I can suck
	melancholy out of a song as a weasel sucks eggs
	More I prithee more

AMIENS	My voice is ragged I know I cannot please you

JAQUES	I do not desire you to please me I do desire you to
	sing Come more another stanzo call you em stanzos?

AMIENS	What you will Monsieur Jaques

JAQUES	Nay I care not for their names they owe me
	nothing Will you sing?

AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself

JAQUES	Well then if ever I thank any man Ill thank you
	but that they call compliment is like the encounter
	of two dogapes and when a man thanks me heartily
	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
	the beggarly thanks Come sing and you that will
	not hold your tongues

AMIENS	Well Ill end the song Sirs cover the while the
	duke will drink under this tree He hath been all
	this day to look you

JAQUES	And I have been all this day to avoid him He is
	too disputable for my company I think of as many
	matters as he but I give heaven thanks and make no
	boast of them Come warble come

	SONG
	Who doth ambition shun

	All together here

	And loves to live i the sun
	Seeking the food he eats
	And pleased with what he gets
	Come hither come hither come hither
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather

JAQUES	Ill give you a verse to this note that I made
	yesterday in despite of my invention

AMIENS	And Ill sing it

JAQUES	Thus it goes

	If it do come to pass
	That any man turn ass
	Leaving his wealth and ease
	A stubborn will to please
	Ducdame ducdame ducdame
	Here shall he see
	Gross fools as he
	An if he will come to me

AMIENS	Whats that ducdame?

JAQUES	Tis a Greek invocation to call fools into a
	circle Ill go sleep if I can if I cannot Ill
	rail against all the firstborn of Egypt

AMIENS	And Ill go seek the duke his banquet is prepared

	Exeunt severally

ACT II



SCENE VII	The forest


	A table set out Enter DUKE SENIOR AMIENS and
	Lords like outlaws

DUKE SENIOR	I think he be transformd into a beast
	For I can no where find him like a man

First Lord	My lord he is but even now gone hence
	Here was he merry hearing of a song

DUKE SENIOR	If he compact of jars grow musical
	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres
	Go seek him tell him I would speak with him

	Enter JAQUES

First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach

DUKE SENIOR	Why how now monsieur what a life is this
	That your poor friends must woo your company?
	What you look merrily

JAQUES	A fool a fool I met a fool i the forest
	A motley fool a miserable world
	As I do live by food I met a fool
	Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun
	And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms
	In good set terms and yet a motley fool
	Good morrow fool quoth I No sir quoth he
	Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune
	And then he drew a dial from his poke
	And looking on it with lacklustre eye
	Says very wisely It is ten oclock
	Thus we may see quoth he how the world wags
	Tis but an hour ago since it was nine
	And after one hour more twill be eleven
	And so from hour to hour we ripe and ripe
	And then from hour to hour we rot and rot
	And thereby hangs a tale When I did hear
	The motley fool thus moral on the time
	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer
	That fools should be so deepcontemplative
	And I did laugh sans intermission
	An hour by his dial O noble fool
	A worthy fool Motleys the only wear

DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?

JAQUES	O worthy fool One that hath been a courtier
	And says if ladies be but young and fair
	They have the gift to know it and in his brain
	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
	After a voyage he hath strange places crammd
	With observation the which he vents
	In mangled forms O that I were a fool
	I am ambitious for a motley coat

DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one

JAQUES	It is my only suit
	Provided that you weed your better judgments
	Of all opinion that grows rank in them
	That I am wise I must have liberty
	Withal as large a charter as the wind
	To blow on whom I please for so fools have
	And they that are most galled with my folly
	They most must laugh And why sir must they so?
	The why is plain as way to parish church
	He that a fool doth very wisely hit
	Doth very foolishly although he smart
	Not to seem senseless of the bob if not
	The wise mans folly is anatomized
	Even by the squandering glances of the fool
	Invest me in my motley give me leave
	To speak my mind and I will through and through
	Cleanse the foul body of the infected world
	If they will patiently receive my medicine

DUKE SENIOR	Fie on thee I can tell what thou wouldst do

JAQUES	What for a counter would I do but good?

DUKE SENIOR	Most mischievous foul sin in chiding sin
	For thou thyself hast been a libertine
	As sensual as the brutish sting itself
	And all the embossed sores and headed evils
	That thou with licence of free foot hast caught
	Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world

JAQUES	Why who cries out on pride
	That can therein tax any private party?
	Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea
	Till that the weary very means do ebb?
	What woman in the city do I name
	When that I say the citywoman bears
	The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
	Who can come in and say that I mean her
	When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
	Or what is he of basest function
	That says his bravery is not of my cost
	Thinking that I mean him but therein suits
	His folly to the mettle of my speech?
	There then how then? what then? Let me see wherein
	My tongue hath wrongd him if it do him right
	Then he hath wrongd himself if he be free
	Why then my taxing like a wildgoose flies
	Unclaimd of any man But who comes here?

	Enter ORLANDO with his sword drawn

ORLANDO	Forbear and eat no more

JAQUES	Why I have eat none yet

ORLANDO	Nor shalt not till necessity be served

JAQUES	Of what kind should this cock come of?

DUKE SENIOR	Art thou thus boldend man by thy distress
	Or else a rude despiser of good manners
	That in civility thou seemst so empty?

ORLANDO	You touchd my vein at first the thorny point
	Of bare distress hath taen from me the show
	Of smooth civility yet am I inland bred
	And know some nurture But forbear I say
	He dies that touches any of this fruit
	Till I and my affairs are answered

JAQUES	An you will not be answered with reason I must die

DUKE SENIOR	What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
	More than your force move us to gentleness

ORLANDO	I almost die for food and let me have it

DUKE SENIOR	Sit down and feed and welcome to our table

ORLANDO	Speak you so gently? Pardon me I pray you
	I thought that all things had been savage here
	And therefore put I on the countenance
	Of stern commandment But whateer you are
	That in this desert inaccessible
	Under the shade of melancholy boughs
	Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
	If ever you have lookd on better days
	If ever been where bells have knolld to church
	If ever sat at any good mans feast
	If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
	And know what tis to pity and be pitied
	Let gentleness my strong enforcement be
	In the which hope I blush and hide my sword

DUKE SENIOR	True is it that we have seen better days
	And have with holy bell been knolld to church
	And sat at good mens feasts and wiped our eyes
	Of drops that sacred pity hath engenderd
	And therefore sit you down in gentleness
	And take upon command what help we have
	That to your wanting may be ministerd

ORLANDO	Then but forbear your food a little while
	Whiles like a doe I go to find my fawn
	And give it food There is an old poor man
	Who after me hath many a weary step
	Limpd in pure love till he be first sufficed
	Oppressd with two weak evils age and hunger
	I will not touch a bit

DUKE SENIOR	Go find him out
	And we will nothing waste till you return

ORLANDO	I thank ye and be blest for your good comfort

	Exit

DUKE SENIOR	Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy
	This wide and universal theatre
	Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
	Wherein we play in

JAQUES	All the worlds a stage
	And all the men and women merely players
	They have their exits and their entrances
	And one man in his time plays many parts
	His acts being seven ages At first the infant
	Mewling and puking in the nurses arms
	And then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
	And shining morning face creeping like snail
	Unwillingly to school And then the lover
	Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
	Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier
	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
	Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
	Seeking the bubble reputation
	Even in the cannons mouth And then the justice
	In fair round belly with good capon lined
	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut
	Full of wise saws and modern instances
	And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
	Into the lean and slipperd pantaloon
	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side
	His youthful hose well saved a world too wide
	For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
	Turning again toward childish treble pipes
	And whistles in his sound Last scene of all
	That ends this strange eventful history
	Is second childishness and mere oblivion
	Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything

	Reenter ORLANDO with ADAM

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome Set down your venerable burthen
	And let him feed

ORLANDO	I thank you most for him

ADAM	So had you need
	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome fall to I will not trouble you
	As yet to question you about your fortunes
	Give us some music and good cousin sing

	SONG
