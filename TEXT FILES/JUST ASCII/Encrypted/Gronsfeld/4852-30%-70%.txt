                              INTRODUCTION

The Workshop on Electronic Texts  drew together representatives of
various projects and interest groups to compare ideas beliefs
experiences and in particular methods of placing and presenting
historical textual materials in computerized form  Most attendees gained
much in insight and outlook from the event  But the assembly did not
form a new nation or to put it another way the diversity of projects
and interests was too great to draw the representatives into a cohesive
actionoriented body

Everyone attending the Workshop shared an interest in preserving and
providing access to historical texts  But within this broad field the
attendees represented a variety of formal informal figurative and
literal groups with many individuals belonging to more than one  These
groups may be defined roughly according to the following topics or
activities

 Imaging
 Searchable coded texts
 National and international computer networks
 CDROM production and dissemination
 Methods and technology for converting older paper materials into
electronic form
 Study of the use of digital materials by scholars and others

This summary is arranged thematically and does not follow the actual
sequence of presentations

NOTES
       In this document the phrase electronic text is used to mean
     any computerized reproduction or version of a document book
     article or manuscript including images and not merely a machine
     readable or machinesearchable text

       The Workshop was held at the Library of Congress on  June
      with funding from the David and Lucile Packard Foundation
     The document that follows represents a summary of the presentations
     made at the Workshop and was compiled by James DALY  This
     introduction was written by DALY and Carl FLEISCHHAUER


PRESERVATION AND IMAGING

Preservation as that term is used by archivists was most explicitly
discussed in the context of imaging  Anne KENNEY and Lynne PERSONIUS
explained how the concept of a faithful copy and the userfriendliness of
the traditional book have guided their project at Cornell University
Although interested in computerized dissemination participants in the
Cornell project are creating digital image sets of older books in the
public domain as a source for a fresh paper facsimile or in a future
phase microfilm  The books returned to the library shelves are
highquality and useful replacements on acidfree paper that should last
a long time  To date the Cornell project has placed little or no
emphasis on creating searchable texts one would not be surprised to find
that the project participants view such texts as new editions and thus
not as faithful reproductions

In her talk on preservation Patricia BATTIN struck an ecumenical and
flexible note as she endorsed the creation and dissemination of a variety
of types of digital copies  Do not be too narrow in defining what counts
as a preservation element BATTIN counseled for the present at least
digital copies made with preservation in mind cannot be as narrowly
standardized as say microfilm copies with the same objective  Setting
standards precipitously can inhibit creativity but delay can result in
chaos she advised

In part BATTINs position reflected the unsettled nature of imageformat
standards and attendees could hear echoes of this unsettledness in the
comments of various speakers  For example Jean BARONAS reviewed the
status of several formal standards moving through committees of experts
and Clifford LYNCH encouraged the use of a new guideline for transmitting
document images on Internet  Testimony from participants in the National
Agricultural Librarys NAL Text Digitization Program and LCs American
Memory project highlighted some of the challenges to the actual creation
or interchange of images including difficulties in converting
preservation microfilm to digital form  Donald WATERS reported on the
progress of a master plan for a project at Yale University to convert
books on microfilm to digital image sets Project Open Book POB

The Workshop offered rather less of an imaging practicum than planned
but "howto" hints emerge at various points for example throughout
KENNEYs presentation and in the discussion of arcana such as
thresholding and dithering offered by George THOMA and FLEISCHHAUER

NOTES
       Although there is a sense in which any reproductions of
     historical materials preserve the human record specialists in the
     field have developed particular guidelines for the creation of
     acceptable preservation copies

THE MACHINEREADABLE TEXT  MARKUP AND USE

The sections of the Workshop that dealt with machinereadable text tended
to be more concerned with access and use than with preservation at least
in the narrow technical sense  Michael SPERBERGMcQUEEN made a forceful
presentation on the Text Encoding Initiatives TEI implementation of
the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML  His ideas were echoed
by Susan HOCKEY Elli MYLONAS and Stuart WEIBEL  While the
presentations made by the TEI advocates contained no practicum their
discussion focused on the value of the finished product what the
European Community calls reusability but what may also be termed
durability  They argued that marking upthat is codinga text in a
wellconceived way will permit it to be moved from one computer
environment to another as well as to be used by various users  Two
kinds of markup were distinguished   procedural markup which
describes the features of a text eg dots on a page and 
descriptive markup which describes the structure or elements of a
document eg chapters paragraphs and front matter

The TEI proponents emphasized the importance of texts to scholarship
They explained how heavily coded and thus analyzed and annotated texts
can underlie research play a role in scholarly communication and
facilitate classroom teaching  SPERBERGMcQUEEN reminded listeners that
a written or printed item eg a particular edition of a book is
merely a representation of the abstraction we call a text  To concern
ourselves with faithfully reproducing a printed instance of the text
SPERBERGMcQUEEN argued is to concern ourselves with the representation
of a representation "images as simulacra for the text"  The TEI proponents
interest in images tends to focus on corollary materials for use in teaching
for example photographs of the Acropolis to accompany a Greek text

By the end of the Workshop SPERBERGMcQUEEN confessed to having been
converted to a limited extent to the view that electronic images
constitute a promising alternative to microfilming indeed an
alternative probably superior to microfilming  But he was not convinced
that electronic images constitute a serious attempt to represent text in
electronic form  HOCKEY and MYLONAS also conceded that their experience
at the Pierce Symposium the previous week at Georgetown University and
the present conference at the Library of Congress had compelled them to
reevaluate their perspective on the usefulness of text as images
Attendees could see that the text and image advocates were in
constructive tension so to say

Three nonTEI presentations described approaches to preparing
machinereadable text that are less rigorous and thus less expensive  In
the case of the Papers of George Washington Dorothy TWOHIG explained
that the digital version will provide a notquiteperfect rendering of
the transcribed textsome  documents available for research
during the decades while the perfect or print version is completed
Members of the American Memory team and the staff of NALs Text
Digitization Program see below also outlined a middle ground concerning
searchable texts  In the case of American Memory contractors produce
texts with about percent accuracy that serve as "browse" or
"reference" versions of written or printed originals  End users who need
faithful copies or perfect renditions must refer to accompanying sets of
digital facsimile images or consult copies of the originals in a nearby
library or archive  American Memory staff argued that the high cost of
producing percent accurate copies would prevent LC from offering
access to large parts of its collections


THE MACHINEREADABLE TEXT  METHODS OF CONVERSION

Although the Workshop did not include a systematic examination of the
methods for converting texts from paper or from facsimile images into
machinereadable form nevertheless various speakers touched upon this
matter  For example WEIBEL reported that OCLC has experimented with a
merging of multiple optical character recognition systems that will
reduce errors from an unacceptable rate of  characters out of every
l to an unacceptable rate of  characters out of every l

Pamela ANDRE presented an overview of NALs Text Digitization Program and
Judith ZIDAR discussed the technical details  ZIDAR explained how NAL
purchased hardware and software capable of performing optical character
recognition OCR and text conversion and used its own staff to convert
texts  The process ZIDAR said required extensive editing and project
staff found themselves considering alternatives including rekeying
andor creating abstracts or summaries of texts  NAL reckoned costs at
 per page  By way of contrast Ricky ERWAY explained that American
Memory had decided from the start to contract out conversion to external
service bureaus  The criteria used to select these contractors were cost
and quality of results as opposed to methods of conversion  ERWAY noted
that historical documents or books often do not lend themselves to OCR
Bound materials represent a special problem  In her experience quality
controlinspecting incoming materials counting errors in samplesposed
the most timeconsuming aspect of contracting out conversion  ERWAY
reckoned American Memorys costs at  per page but cautioned that fewer
costelements had been included than in NALs figure


OPTIONS FOR DISSEMINATION

The topic of dissemination proper emerged at various points during the
Workshop  At the session devoted to national and international computer
networks LYNCH Howard BESSER Ronald LARSEN and Edwin BROWNRIGG
highlighted the virtues of Internet today and of the network that will
evolve from Internet  Listeners could discern in these narratives a
vision of an information democracy in which millions of citizens freely
find and use what they need  LYNCH noted that a lack of standards
inhibits disseminating multimedia on the network a topic also discussed
by BESSER  LARSEN addressed the issues of network scalability and
modularity and commented upon the difficulty of anticipating the effects
of growth in orders of magnitude  BROWNRIGG talked about the ability of
packet radio to provide certain links in a network without the need for
wiring  However the presenters also called attention to the
shortcomings and incongruities of presentday computer networks  For
example   Network use is growing dramatically but much network
traffic consists of personal communication Email   Large bodies of
information are available but a users ability to search across their
entirety is limited   There are significant resources for science and
technology but few network sources provide content in the humanities
 Machinereadable texts are commonplace but the capability of the
system to deal with images let alone other media formats lags behind
A glimpse of a multimedia future for networks however was provided by
Maria LEBRON in her overview of the Online Journal of Current Clinical
Trials OJCCT and the process of scholarly publishing online

The contrasting form of the CDROM disk was never systematically
analyzed but attendees could glean an impression from several of the
showandtell presentations  The Perseus and American Memory examples
demonstrated recently published disks while the descriptions of the
IBYCUS version of the Papers of George Washington and ChadwyckHealeys
Patrologia Latina Database PLD told of disks to come  According to
Eric CALALUCA PLDs principal focus has been on converting JacquesPaul
Mignes definitive collection of Latin texts to machinereadable form
Although everyone could share the network advocates enthusiasm for an
online future the possibility of rolling up ones sleeves for a session
with a CDROM containing both textual materials and a powerful retrieval
engine made the disk seem an appealing vessel indeed  The overall
discussion suggested that the transition from CDROM to online networked
access may prove far slower and more difficult than has been anticipated


WHO ARE THE USERS AND WHAT DO THEY DO?

Although concerned with the technicalities of production the Workshop
never lost sight of the purposes and uses of electronic versions of
textual materials  As noted above those interested in imaging discussed
the problematical matter of digital preservation while the TEI proponents
described how machinereadable texts can be used in research  This latter
topic received thorough treatment in the paper read by Avra MICHELSON
She placed the phenomenon of electronic texts within the context of
broader trends in information technology and scholarly communication

Among other things MICHELSON described online conferences that
represent a vigorous and important intellectual forum for certain
disciplines  Internet now carries more than  conferences with about
 percent of these devoted to topics in the social sciences and the
humanities  Other scholars use online networks for "distance learning"
Meanwhile there has been a tremendous growth in enduser computing
professors today are less likely than their predecessors to ask the
campus computer center to process their data  Electronic texts are one
key to these sophisticated applications MICHELSON reported and more and
more scholars in the humanities now work in an online environment
Toward the end of the Workshop Michael LESK presented a corollary to
MICHELSONs talk reporting the results of an experiment that compared
the work of one group of chemistry students using traditional printed
texts and two groups using electronic sources  The experiment
demonstrated that in the event one does not know what to read one needs
the electronic systems the electronic systems hold no advantage at the
moment if one knows what to read but neither do they impose a penalty

DALY provided an anecdotal account of the revolutionizing impact of the
new technology on his previous methods of research in the field of classics
His account by extrapolation served to illustrate in part the arguments
made by MICHELSON concerning the positive effects of the sudden and radical
transformation being wrought in the ways scholars work

Susan VECCIA and Joanne FREEMAN delineated the use of electronic
materials outside the university  The most interesting aspect of their
use FREEMAN said could be seen as a paradox  teachers in elementary
and secondary schools requested access to primary source materials but
at the same time found that "primariness" itself made these materials
difficult for their students to use


OTHER TOPICS

Marybeth PETERS reviewed copyright law in the United States and offered
advice during a lively discussion of this subject  But uncertainty
remains concerning the price of copyright in a digital medium because a
solution remains to be worked out concerning management and synthesis of
copyrighted and outofcopyright pieces of a database

As moderator of the final session of the Workshop Prosser GIFFORD directed
discussion to future courses of action and the potential role of LC in
advancing them  Among the recommendations that emerged were the following

      Workshop participants should  begin to think about working
     with image material but structure and digitize it in such a
     way that at a later stage it can be interpreted into text and
      find a common way to build text and images together so that
     they can be used jointly at some stage in the future with
     appropriate network support because that is how users will want
     to access these materials  The Library might encourage attempts
     to bring together people who are working on texts and images

      A network version of American Memory should be developed or
     consideration should be given to making the data in it
     available to people interested in doing network multimedia
     Given the current dearth of digital data that is appealing and
     unencumbered by extremely complex rights problems developing a
     network version of American Memory could do much to help make
     network multimedia a reality

      Concerning the thorny issue of electronic deposit LC should
     initiate a catalytic process in terms of distributed
     responsibility that is bring together the distributed
     organizations and set up a study group to look at all the
     issues related to electronic deposit and see where we as a
     nation should move  For example LC might attempt to persuade
     one major library in each state to deal with its state
     equivalent publisher which might produce a cooperative project
     that would be equitably distributed around the country and one
     in which LC would be dealing with a minimal number of publishers
     and minimal copyright problems  LC must also deal with the
     concept of online publishing determining among other things
     how serials such as OJCCT might be deposited for copyright

      Since a number of projects are planning to carry out
     preservation by creating digital images that will end up in
     online or nearline storage at some institution LC might play
     a helpful role at least in the near term by accelerating how
     to catalog that information into the Research Library Information
     Network RLIN and then into OCLC so that it would be accessible
     This would reduce the possibility of multiple institutions digitizing
     the same work


CONCLUSION

The Workshop was valuable because it brought together partisans from
various groups and provided an occasion to compare goals and methods
The more committed partisans frequently communicate with others in their
groups but less often across group boundaries  The Workshop was also
valuable to attendeesincluding those involved with American Memorywho
came less committed to particular approaches or concepts  These
attendees learned a great deal and plan to select and employ elements of
imaging textcoding and networked distribution that suit their
respective projects and purposes

Still reality rears its ugly head  no breakthrough has been achieved
On the imaging side one confronts a proliferation of competing
datainterchange standards and a lack of consensus on the role of digital
facsimiles in preservation  In the realm of machinereadable texts one
encounters a reasonably mature standard but methodological difficulties
and high costs  These latter problems of course represent a special
impediment to the desire as it is sometimes expressed in the popular
press "to put the contents of the Library of Congress on line"  In
the words of one participant there was "no solution to the economic
problemsthe projects that are out there are surviving but it is going
to be a lot of work to transform the information industry and so far the
investment to do that is not forthcoming" LESK per litteras

WELCOME


GIFFORD  Origin of Workshop in current Librarians desire to make LCs
collections more widely available  Desiderata arising from the prospect
of greater interconnectedness 


After welcoming participants on behalf of the Library of Congress
American Memory AM and the National Demonstration Lab Prosser
GIFFORD director for scholarly programs Library of Congress located
the origin of the Workshop on Electronic Texts in a conversation he had
had considerably more than a year ago with Carl FLEISCHHAUER concerning
some of the issues faced by AM  On the assumption that numerous other
people were asking the same questions the decision was made to bring
together as many of these people as possible to ask the same questions
together  In a deeper sense GIFFORD said the origin of the Workshop
lay in the desire of the current Librarian of Congress James H
Billington to make the collections of the Library especially those
offering unique or unusual testimony on aspects of the American
experience available to a much wider circle of users than those few
people who can come to Washington to use them  This meant that the
emphasis of AM from the outset has been on archival collections of the
basic material and on making these collections themselves available
rather than selected or heavily edited products

From AMs emphasis followed the questions with which the Workshop began
who will use these materials and in what form will they wish to use
them  But an even larger issue deserving mention in GIFFORDs view was
the phenomenal growth in Internet connectivity  He expressed the hope
that the prospect of greater interconnectedness than ever before would
lead to   much more cooperative and mutually supportive endeavors 
development of systems of shared and distributed responsibilities to
avoid duplication and to ensure accuracy and preservation of unique
materials and  agreement on the necessary standards and development of
the appropriate directories and indices to make navigation
straightforward among the varied resources that are and increasingly
will be available  In this connection GIFFORD requested that
participants reflect from the outset upon the sorts of outcomes they
thought the Workshop might have  Did those present constitute a group
with sufficient common interests to propose a next step or next steps
and if so what might those be?  They would return to these questions the
following afternoon

                                 


FLEISCHHAUER  Core of Workshop concerns preparation and production of
materials  Special challenge in conversion of textual materials 
Quality versus quantity  Do the several groups represented share common
interests? 


Carl FLEISCHHAUER coordinator American Memory Library of Congress
emphasized that he would attempt to represent the people who perform some
of the work of converting or preparing  materials and that the core of
the Workshop had to do with preparation and production  FLEISCHHAUER
then drew a distinction between the long term when many things would be
available and connected in the ways that GIFFORD described and the short
term in which AM not only has wrestled with the issue of what is the
best course to pursue but also has faced a variety of technical
challenges

FLEISCHHAUER remarked AMs endeavors to deal with a wide range of library
formats such as motion picture collections soundrecording collections
and pictorial collections of various sorts especially collections of
photographs  In the course of these efforts AM kept coming back to
textual materialsmanuscripts or rare printed matter bound materials
etc  Text posed the greatest conversion challenge of all  Thus the
genesis of the Workshop which reflects the problems faced by AM  These
problems include physical problems  For example those in the library
and archive business deal with collections made up of fragile and rare
manuscript items bound materials especially the notoriously brittle
bound materials of the late nineteenth century  These are precious
cultural artifacts however as well as interesting sources of
information and LC desires to retain and conserve them  AM needs to
handle things without damaging them  Guillotining a book to run it
through a sheet feeder must be avoided at all costs

Beyond physical problems issues pertaining to quality arose  For
example the desire to provide users with a searchable text is affected
by the question of acceptable level of accuracy  One hundred percent
accuracy is tremendously expensive  On the other hand the output of
optical character recognition OCR can be tremendously inaccurate
Although AM has attempted to find a middle ground uncertainty persists
as to whether or not it has discovered the right solution

Questions of quality arose concerning images as well  FLEISCHHAUER
contrasted the extremely high level of quality of the digital images in
the Cornell Xerox Project with AMs efforts to provide a browsequality
or accessquality image as opposed to an archival or preservation image
FLEISCHHAUER therefore welcomed the opportunity to compare notes

FLEISCHHAUER observed in passing that conversations he had had about
networks have begun to signal that for various forms of media a
determination may be made that there is a browsequality item or a
distributionandaccessquality item that may coexist in some systems
with a higher quality archival item that would be inconvenient to send
through the network because of its size  FLEISCHHAUER referred of
course to images more than to searchable text

As AM considered those questions several conceptual issues arose  ought
AM occasionally to reproduce materials entirely through an image set at
other times entirely through a text set and in some cases a mix?
There probably would be times when the historical authenticity of an
artifact would require that its image be used  An image might be
desirable as a recourse for users if one could not provide percent
accurate text  Again AM wondered as a practical matter if a
distinction could be drawn between rare printed matter that might exist
in multiple collectionsthat is in ten or fifteen libraries  In such
cases the need for perfect reproduction would be less than for unique
items  Implicit in his remarks FLEISCHHAUER conceded was the admission
that AM has been tilting strongly towards quantity and drawing back a
little from perfect quality  That is it seemed to AM that society would
be better served if more things were distributed by LCeven if they were
not quite perfectthan if fewer things perfectly represented were
distributed  This was stated as a proposition to be tested with
responses to be gathered from users

In thinking about issues related to reproduction of materials and seeing
other people engaged in parallel activities AM deemed it useful to
convene a conference  Hence the Workshop  FLEISCHHAUER thereupon
surveyed the several groups represented   the world of images image
users and image makers  the world of text and scholarship and within
this group those concerned with languageFLEISCHHAUER confessed to finding
delightful irony in the fact that some of the most advanced thinkers on
computerized texts are those dealing with ancient Greek and Roman materials
 the network world and  the general world of library science which
includes people interested in preservation and cataloging

FLEISCHHAUER concluded his remarks with special thanks to the David and
Lucile Packard Foundation for its support of the meeting the American
Memory group the Office for Scholarly Programs the National
Demonstration Lab and the Office of Special Events  He expressed the
hope that David Woodley Packard might be able to attend noting that
Packards work and the work of the foundation had sponsored a number of
projects in the text area

                                 

SESSION I  CONTENT IN A NEW FORM   WHO WILL USE IT AND WHAT WILL THEY DO?


DALY  Acknowledgements  A new Latin authors disk   Effects of the new
technology on previous methods of research 


Serving as moderator James DALY acknowledged the generosity of all the
presenters for giving of their time counsel and patience in planning
the Workshop as well as of members of the American Memory project and
other Library of Congress staff and the David and Lucile Packard
Foundation and its executive director Colburn S Wilbur

DALY then recounted his visit in March to the Center for Electronic Texts
in the Humanities CETH and the Department of Classics at Rutgers
University where an old friend Lowell Edmunds introduced him to the
departments IBYCUS scholarly personal computer and in particular the
new Latin CDROM containing among other things almost all classical
Latin literary texts through AD   Packard Humanities Institute
PHI Los Altos California released this disk late in  with a
nominal triennial licensing fee

Playing with the disk for an hour or so at Rutgers brought home to DALY
at once the revolutionizing impact of the new technology on his previous
methods of research  Had this disk been available two or three years
earlier DALY contended when he was engaged in preparing a commentary on
Book  of Virgils Aeneid for Cambridge University Press he would not
have required a fortyeightsquarefoot table on which to spread the
numerous most frequently consulted items including some ten or twelve
concordances to key Latin authors an almost equal number of lexica to
authors who lacked concordances and where either lexica or concordances
were lacking numerous editions of authors antedating and postdating Virgil

Nor when checking each of the average six to seven words contained in
the Virgilian hexameter for its usage elsewhere in Virgils works or
other Latin authors would DALY have had to maintain the laborious
mechanical process of flipping through these concordances lexica and
editions each time  Nor would he have had to frequent as often the
Milton S Eisenhower Library at the Johns Hopkins University to consult
the Thesaurus Linguae Latinae  Instead of devoting countless hours or
the bulk of his research time to gathering data concerning Virgils use
of words DALYnow freed by PHIs Latin authors disk from the
tyrannical yet in some ways paradoxically happy scholarly drudgery
would have been able to devote that same bulk of time to analyzing and
interpreting Virgilian verbal usage

Citing Theodore Brunner Gregory Crane Elli MYLONAS and Avra MICHELSON
DALY argued that this reversal in his style of work made possible by the
new technology would perhaps have resulted in better more productive
research  Indeed even in the course of his browsing the Latin authors
disk at Rutgers its powerful search retrieval and highlighting
capabilities suggested to him several new avenues of research into
Virgils use of sound effects  This anecdotal account DALY maintained
may serve to illustrate in part the sudden and radical transformation
being wrought in the ways scholars work

                                 


MICHELSON  Elements related to scholarship and technology  Electronic
texts within the context of broader trends within information technology
and scholarly communication  Evaluation of the prospects for the use of
electronic texts  Relationship of electronic texts to processes of
scholarly communication in humanities research  New exchange formats
created by scholars  Projects initiated to increase scholarly access to
converted text  Trend toward making electronic resources available
through research and education networks  Changes taking place in
scholarly communication among humanities scholars  Networkmediated
scholarship transforming traditional scholarly practices  Key
information technology trends affecting the conduct of scholarly
communication over the next decade  The trend toward enduser computing
 The trend toward greater connectivity  Effects of these trends  Key
transformations taking place  Summary of principal arguments 


Avra MICHELSON Archival Research and Evaluation Staff National Archives
and Records Administration NARA argued that establishing who will use
electronic texts and what they will use them for involves a consideration
of both information technology and scholarship trends  This
consideration includes several elements related to scholarship and
technology   the key trends in information technology that are most
relevant to scholarship  the key trends in the use of currently
available technology by scholars in the nonscientific community and 
the relationship between these two very distinct but interrelated trends
The investment in understanding this relationship being made by
information providers technologists and public policy developers as
well as by scholars themselves seems to be pervasive and growing
MICHELSON contended  She drew on collaborative work with Jeff Rothenberg
on the scholarly use of technology

MICHELSON sought to place the phenomenon of electronic texts within the
context of broader trends within information technology and scholarly
communication  She argued that electronic texts are of most use to
researchers to the extent that the researchers working context ie
their relevant bibliographic sources collegial feedback analytic tools
notes drafts etc along with their fields primary and secondary
sources also is accessible in electronic form and can be integrated in
ways that are unique to the online environment

Evaluation of the prospects for the use of electronic texts includes two
elements   an examination of the ways in which researchers currently
are using electronic texts along with other electronic resources and 
an analysis of key information technology trends that are affecting the
longterm conduct of scholarly communication  MICHELSON limited her
discussion of the use of electronic texts to the practices of humanists
and noted that the scientific community was outside the panels overview

MICHELSON examined the nature of the current relationship of electronic
texts in particular and electronic resources in general to what she
maintained were essentially five processes of scholarly communication
in humanities research  Researchers  identify sources  communicate
with their colleagues  interpret and analyze data  disseminate
their research findings and  prepare curricula to instruct the next
generation of scholars and students  This examination would produce a
clearer understanding of the synergy among these five processes that
fuels the tendency of the use of electronic resources for one process to
stimulate its use for other processes of scholarly communication

For the first process of scholarly communication the identification of
sources MICHELSON remarked the opportunity scholars now enjoy to
supplement traditional wordofmouth searches for sources among their
colleagues with new forms of electronic searching  So for example
instead of having to visit the library researchers are able to explore
descriptions of holdings in their offices  Furthermore if their own
institutions holdings prove insufficient scholars can access more than
 major American library catalogues over Internet including the
universities of California Michigan Pennsylvania and Wisconsin
Direct access to the bibliographic databases offers intellectual
empowerment to scholars by presenting a comprehensive means of browsing
through libraries from their homes and offices at their convenience

The second process of communication involves communication among
scholars  Beyond the most common methods of communication scholars are
using Email and a variety of new electronic communications formats
derived from it for further academic interchange  Email exchanges are
growing at an astonishing rate reportedly  percent a month  They
currently constitute approximately half the traffic on research and
education networks  Moreover the global spread of Email has been so
rapid that it is now possible for American scholars to use it to
communicate with colleagues in close to  other countries

Other new exchange formats created by scholars and operating on Internet
include more than  conferences with about  percent of these devoted
to topics in the social sciences and humanities  The rate of growth of
these scholarly electronic conferences also is astonishing  From l to
l  new conferences were identified on Internet  From October 
to June  an additional  conferences in the social sciences and
humanities were added to this directory of listings  Scholars have
established conferences in virtually every field within every different
discipline  For example there are currently close to  active social
science and humanities  conferences on topics such as art and
architecture ethnomusicology folklore Japanese culture medical
education and gifted and talented education  The appeal to scholars of
communicating through these conferences is that unlike any other medium
electronic conferences today provide a forum for global communication
with peers at the front end of the research process

Interpretation and analysis of sources constitutes the third process of
scholarly communication that MICHELSON discussed in terms of texts and
textual resources  The methods used to analyze sources fall somewhere on
a continuum from quantitative analysis to qualitative analysis
Typically evidence is culled and evaluated using methods drawn from both
ends of this continuum  At one end quantitative analysis involves the
use of mathematical processes such as a count of frequencies and
distributions of occurrences or on a higher level regression analysis
At the other end of the continuum qualitative analysis typically
involves nonmathematical processes oriented toward language
interpretation or the building of theory  Aspects of this work involve
the processingeither manual or computationalof large and sometimes
massive amounts of textual sources although the use of nontextual
sources as evidence such as photographs sound recordings film footage
and artifacts is significant as well

Scholars have discovered that many of the methods of interpretation and
analysis that are related to both quantitative and qualitative methods
are processes that can be performed by computers  For example computers
can count  They can count brush strokes used in a Rembrandt painting or
perform regression analysis for understanding cause and effect  By means
of advanced technologies computers can recognize patterns analyze text
and model concepts  Furthermore computers can complete these processes
faster with more sources and with greater precision than scholars who
must rely on manual interpretation of data  But if scholars are to use
computers for these processes source materials must be in a form
amenable to computerassisted analysis  For this reason many scholars
once they have identified the sources that are key to their research are
converting them to machinereadable form  Thus a representative example
of the numerous textual conversion projects organized by scholars around
the world in recent years to support computational text analysis is the
TLG the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae  This project is devoted to
converting the extant ancient texts of classical Greece  Editors note
according to the TLG Newsletter of May l TLG was in use in thirtytwo
different countries  This figure updates MICHELSONs previous count by one

The scholars performing these conversions have been asked to recognize
that the electronic sources they are converting for one use possess value
for other research purposes as well  As a result during the past few
years humanities scholars have initiated a number of projects to
increase scholarly access to converted text  So for example the Text
Encoding Initiative TEI about which more is said later in the program
was established as an effort by scholars to determine standard elements
and methods for encoding machinereadable text for electronic exchange
In a second effort to facilitate the sharing of converted text scholars
have created a new institution the Center for Electronic Texts in the
Humanities CETH  The center estimates that there are  series of
source texts in the humanities that have been converted to
machinereadable form worldwide  CETH is undertaking an international
search for converted text in the humanities compiling it into an
electronic library and preparing bibliographic descriptions of the
sources for the Research Libraries Information Networks RLIN
machinereadable data file  The library profession has begun to initiate
large conversion projects as well such as American Memory

While scholars have been making converted text available to one another
typically on disk or on CDROM the clear trend is toward making these
resources available through reWLJZHP CNM MHXHEARWS VGTFWVNX  XODA YPG
