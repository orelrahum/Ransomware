	And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
	He sends this bloody napkin Are you he?

ROSALIND	I am what must we understand by this?

OLIVER	Some of my shame if you will know of me
	What man I am and how and why and where
	This handkercher was staind

CELIA	I pray you tell it

OLIVER	When last the young Orlando parted from you
	He left a promise to return again
	Within an hour and pacing through the forest
	Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy
	Lo what befell he threw his eye aside
	And mark what object did present itself
	Under an oak whose boughs were mossd with age
	And high top bald with dry antiquity
	A wretched ragged man oergrown with hair
	Lay sleeping on his back about his neck
	A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself
	Who with her head nimble in threats approachd
	The opening of his mouth but suddenly
	Seeing Orlando it unlinkd itself
	And with indented glides did slip away
	Into a bush under which bushs shade
	A lioness with udders all drawn dry
	Lay couching head on ground with catlike watch
	When that the sleeping man should stir for tis
	The royal disposition of that beast
	To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead
	This seen Orlando did approach the man
	And found it was his brother his elder brother

CELIA	O I have heard him speak of that same brother
	And he did render him the most unnatural
	That lived amongst men

OLIVER	And well he might so do
	For well I know he was unnatural

ROSALIND	But to Orlando did he leave him there
	Food to the suckd and hungry lioness?

OLIVER	Twice did he turn his back and purposed so
	But kindness nobler ever than revenge
	And nature stronger than his just occasion
	Made him give battle to the lioness
	Who quickly fell before him in which hurtling
	From miserable slumber I awaked

CELIA	Are you his brother?

ROSALIND	Wast you he rescued?

CELIA	Wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

OLIVER	Twas I but tis not I	I do not shame
	To tell you what I was since my conversion
	So sweetly tastes being the thing I am

ROSALIND	But for the bloody napkin?

OLIVER	By and by
	When from the first to last betwixt us two
	Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed
	As how I came into that desert place
	In brief he led me to the gentle duke
	Who gave me fresh array and entertainment
	Committing me unto my brothers love
	Who led me instantly unto his cave
	There strippd himself and here upon his arm
	The lioness had torn some flesh away
	Which all this while had bled and now he fainted
	And cried in fainting upon Rosalind
	Brief I recoverd him bound up his wound
	And after some small space being strong at heart
	He sent me hither stranger as I am
	To tell this story that you might excuse
	His broken promise and to give this napkin
	Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
	That he in sport doth call his Rosalind

	ROSALIND swoons

CELIA	Why how now Ganymede sweet Ganymede

OLIVER	Many will swoon when they do look on blood

CELIA	There is more in it Cousin Ganymede

OLIVER	Look he recovers

ROSALIND	I would I were at home

CELIA	Well lead you thither
	I pray you will you take him by the arm?

OLIVER	Be of good cheer youth you a man you lack a
	mans heart

ROSALIND	I do so I confess it Ah sirrah a body would
	think this was well counterfeited I pray you tell
	your brother how well I counterfeited Heighho

OLIVER	This was not counterfeit there is too great
	testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
	of earnest

ROSALIND	Counterfeit I assure you

OLIVER	Well then take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man

ROSALIND	So I do but i faith I should have been a woman by right

CELIA	Come you look paler and paler pray you draw
	homewards Good sir go with us

OLIVER	That will I for I must bear answer back
	How you excuse my brother Rosalind

ROSALIND	I shall devise something but I pray you commend
	my counterfeiting to him Will you go?

	Exeunt
