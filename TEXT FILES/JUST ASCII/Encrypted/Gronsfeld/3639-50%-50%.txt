After his charge received but from among
Thousand celestial Ardours where he stood
Veiled with his gorgeous wings up springing light
Flew through the midst of Heaven the angelick quires
On each hand parting to his speed gave way
Through all the empyreal road till at the gate
Of Heaven arrived the gate selfopened wide
On golden hinges turning as by work
Divine the sovran Architect had framed
From hence no cloud or to obstruct his sight
Star interposed however small he sees
Not unconformed to other shining globes
Earth and the garden of God with cedars crowned
Above all hills  As when by night the glass
Of Galileo less assured observes
Imagined lands and regions in the moon
Or pilot from amidst the Cyclades
Delos or Samos first appearing kens
A cloudy spot  Down thither prone in flight
He speeds and through the vast ethereal sky
Sails between worlds and worlds with steady wing
Now on the polar winds then with quick fan
Winnows the buxom air till within soar
Of towering eagles to all the fowls he seems
A phoenix gazed by all as that sole bird
When to enshrine his reliques in the Suns
Bright temple to Egyptian Thebes he flies
At once on the eastern cliff of Paradise
He lights and to his proper shape returns
A Seraph winged  Six wings he wore to shade
His lineaments divine the pair that clad
Each shoulder broad came mantling oer his breast
With regal ornament the middle pair
Girt like a starry zone his waist and round
Skirted his loins and thighs with downy gold
And colours dipt in Heaven the third his feet
Shadowed from either heel with feathered mail
Skytinctured grain  Like Maias son he stood
And shook his plumes that heavenly fragrance filled
The circuit wide  Straight knew him all the bands
Of Angels under watch and to his state
And to his message high in honour rise
For on some message high they guessed him bound
Their glittering tents he passed and now is come
Into the blissful field through groves of myrrh
And flowering odours HIUSRI RDWH HWL GINM
