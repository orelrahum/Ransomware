FLEISCHHAUER next demonstrated sound recording which included texts
Recycled from a previous project the collection included sixty rpm
phonograph records of political speeches that were made during and
immediately after World War I  These constituted approximately three
hours of audio as AM has digitized it which occupy  megabytes on a
CD  Thus they are considerably compressed  From the catalogue card
FLEISCHHAUER proceeded to a transcript of a speech with the audio
available and with highlighted text following it as it played
A photograph has been added and a transcription made

Considerable value has been added beyond what the Library of Congress
normally would do in cataloguing a sound recording which raises several
questions for AM concerning where to draw lines about how much value it can
afford to add and at what point perhaps this becomes more than AM could
reasonably do or reasonably wish to do  FLEISCHHAUER also demonstrated
a motion picture  As FREEMAN had reported earlier the motion picture
materials have proved the most popular not surprisingly  This says more
about the medium he thought than about AMs presentation of it

Because AMs goal was to bring together things that could be used by
historians or by people who were curious about history
turnofthecentury footage seemed to represent the most appropriate
collections from the Library of Congress in motion pictures These were
the very first films made by Thomas Edisons company and some others at
that time  The particular example illustrated was a Biograph film
brought in with a framegrabber into a window  A single videodisc
contains about fifty titles and pieces of film from that period all of
New York City  Taken together AM believes they provide an interesting
documentary resource

                                 


DISCUSSION  Using the framegrabber in AM  Volume of material processed
and to be processed  Purpose of AM within LC  Cataloguing and the
nature of AMs material  SGML coding and the question of quality versus
quantity 


During the questionandanswer period that followed FLEISCHHAUERs
presentation several clarifications were made

AM is bringing in motion pictures from a videodisc  The framegrabber
devices create a window on a computer screen which permits users to
digitize a single frame of the movie or one of the photographs  It
produces a crude roughandready image that high school students can
incorporate into papers and that has worked very nicely in this way

Commenting on FLEISCHHAUERs assertion that AM was looking more at
searching ideas than words MYLONAS argued that without words an idea
does not exist  FLEISCHHAUER conceded that he ought to have articulated
his point more clearly  MYLONAS stated that they were in fact both
talking about the same thing  By searching for words and by forcing
people to focus on the word the Perseus Project felt that they would get
them to the idea  The way one reviews results is tailored more to one
kind of user than another

Concerning the total volume of material that has been processed in this
way AM at this point has in retrievable form seven or eight collections
all of them photographic  In the Macintosh environment for example
there probably are  photographs  The sound recordings
number sixty items  The broadsides number about  items  There are
 political cartoons in the form of drawings  The motion pictures as
individual items number sixty to seventy

AM also has a manuscript collection the life history portion of one of
the federal project series which will contain  individual
documents all firstperson narratives  AM has in process about 
AfricanAmerican pamphlets or about  printed pages for the period
  Also in the works are some  panoramic photographs  AM
has recycled a fair amount of the work done by LCs Prints and
Photographs Division during the Librarys optical disk pilot project in
the s  For example a special division of LC has tooled up and
thought through all the ramifications of electronic presentation of
photographs  Indeed they are wheeling them out in great barrel loads
The purpose of AM within the Library it is hoped is to catalyze several
of the other special collection divisions which have no particular
experience with in some cases mixed feelings about an activity such as
AM  Moreover in many cases the divisions may be characterized as not
only lacking experience in "electronifying" things but also in automated
cataloguing  MARC cataloguing as practiced in the United States is
heavily weighted toward the description of monograph and serial
materials but is much thinner when one enters the world of manuscripts
and things that are held in the Librarys music collection and other
units  In response to a comment by LESK that AMs material is very
heavily photographic and is so primarily because individual records have
been made for each photograph FLEISCHHAUER observed that an itemlevel
catalog record exists for example for each photograph in the Detroit
Publishing collection of  pictures  In the case of the Federal
Writers Project for which nearly  documents exist representing
information from twentysix different states AM with the assistance of
Karen STUART of the Manuscript Division will attempt to find some way not
only to have a collectionlevel record but perhaps a MARC record for each
state which will then serve as an umbrella for the  documents
that come under it  But that drama remains to be enacted  The AM staff
is conservative and clings to cataloguing though of course visitors tout
artificial intelligence and neural networks in a manner that suggests that
perhaps one need not have cataloguing or that much of it could be put aside

The matter of SGML coding FLEISCHHAUER conceded returned the discussion
to the earlier treated question of quality versus quantity in the Library
of Congress  Of course text conversion can be done with percent
accuracy but it means that when ones holdings are as vast as LCs only
a tiny amount will be exposed whereas permitting lower levels of
accuracy can lead to exposing or sharing larger amounts but with the
quality correspondingly impaired

                                 


TWOHIG  A contrary experience concerning electronic options  Volume of
material in the Washington papers and a suggestion of David Packard 
Implications of Packards suggestion  Transcribing the documents for the
CDROM  Accuracy of transcriptions  The CDROM edition of the Founding
Fathers documents 


Finding encouragement in a comment of MICHELSONs from the morning
sessionthat numerous people in the humanities were choosing electronic
options to do their workDorothy TWOHIG editor The Papers of George
Washington opened her illustrated talk by noting that her experience
with literary scholars and numerous people in editing was contrary to
MICHELSONs  TWOHIG emphasized literary scholars complete ignorance of
the technological options available to them or their reluctance or in
some cases their downright hostility toward these options

After providing an overview of the five Founding Fathers projects
Jefferson at Princeton Franklin at Yale John Adams at the
Massachusetts Historical Society and Madison down the hall from her at
the University of Virginia TWOHIG observed that the Washington papers
like all of the projects include both sides of the Washington
correspondence and deal with some  documents to be published with
extensive annotation in eighty to eightyfive volumes a project that
will not be completed until well into the next century  Thus it was
with considerable enthusiasm several years ago that the Washington Papers
Project WPP greeted David Packards suggestion that the papers of the
Founding Fathers could be published easily and inexpensively and to the
great benefit of American scholarship via CDROM

In pragmatic terms funding from the Packard Foundation would expedite
the transcription of thousands of documents waiting to be put on disk in
the WPP offices  Further since the costs of collecting editing and
converting the Founding Fathers documents into letterpress editions were
running into the millions of dollars and the considerable staffs
involved in all of these projects were devoting their careers to
producing the work the Packard Foundations suggestion had a
revolutionary aspect  Transcriptions of the entire corpus of the
Founding Fathers papers would be available on CDROM to public and
college libraries even high schools at a fraction of the cost
 for the annual license feeto produce a limited university
press run of  of each volume of the published papers at  per
printed volume  Given the current budget crunch in educational systems
and the corresponding constraints on librarians in smaller institutions
who wish to add these volumes to their collections producing the
documents on CDROM would likely open a greatly expanded audience for the
papers  TWOHIG stressed however that development of the Founding
Fathers CDROM is still in its infancy  Serious software problems remain
to be resolved before the material can be put into readable form

Funding from the Packard Foundation resulted in a major push to
transcribe the  or so documents of the Washington papers remaining
to be transcribed onto computer disks  Slides illustrated several of the
problems encountered for example the present inability of CDROM to
indicate the crossouts deleted material in eighteenth century
documents  TWOHIG next described documents from various periods in the
eighteenth century that have been transcribed in chronological order and
delivered to the Packard offices in California where they are converted
to the CDROM a process that is expected to consume five years to
complete that is reckoning from David Packards suggestion made several
years ago until about July   TWOHIG found an encouraging
indication of the projects benefits in the ongoing use made by scholars
of the search functions of the CDROM particularly in reducing the time
spent in manually turning the pages of the Washington papers

TWOHIG next furnished details concerning the accuracy of transcriptions
For instance the insertion of thousands of documents on the CDROM
currently does not permit each document to be verified against the
original manuscript several times as in the case of documents that appear
in the published edition  However the transcriptions receive a cursory
check for obvious typos the misspellings of proper names and other
errors from the WPP CDROM editor  Eventually all documents that appear
in the electronic verXQQN FQPO GI JQMHSGD KG TUTNLLB JLKTXZW  DQXOXCLP
