Slovenia Economy

Overview
    Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the old Yugoslav republics with
    a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav average indeed not far
    below the levels in neighboring Austria and Italy Because of its strong
    ties to Western Europe and the small scale of damage during internecine
    fighting in Yugoslavia Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the
    former Yugoslav republics for economic reform and recovery over the next few
    years The political and economic disintegration of Yugoslavia however has
    led to severe shortterm dislocations in production employment and trade
    ties For example overall industrial production fell  in 
    particularly hard hit were the iron and steel machinebuilding chemical
    and textile industries Meanwhile fighting has continued in other republics
    leading to further destruction of longestablished trade channels and to an
    influx of tens of thousands of Croatian refugees As in other former
    Communist areas in Eastern Europe economic reform has often sputtered not
    only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of
    the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by
    rankandfile people in the transition to a more marketoriented system The
    key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not
    yet begun Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenias
    comparatively welleducated work force its developed infrastructure and
    its Western business attitudes Slovenia in absolute terms is a small
    economy and a little Western investment would go a long way
