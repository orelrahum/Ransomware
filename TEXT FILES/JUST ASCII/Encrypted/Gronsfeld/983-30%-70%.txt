The supple knee?  Ye will not if I trust
To know ye right or if ye know yourselves
Natives and sons of Heaven possessed before
By none and if not equal all yet free
Equally free for orders and degrees
Jar not with liberty but well consist
Who can in reason then or right assume
Monarchy over such as live by right
His equals if in power and splendour less
In freedom equal? or can introduce
Law and edict on us who without law
Err not? much less for this to be our Lord
And look for adoration to the abuse
Of those imperial titles which assert
Our being ordained to govern not to serve
Thus far his bold discourse without controul
Had audience when among the Seraphim
Abdiel than whom none with more zeal adored
The Deity and divine commands obeyed
Stood up and in a flame of zeal severe
The current of his fury thus opposed
O argument blasphemous false and proud
Words which no ear ever to hear in Heaven
Expected least of all from thee  Ingrate
In place thyself so high above thy peers
Canst thou with impious obloquy condemn
The just decree of God pronounced and sworn
That to his only Son by right endued
With regal scepter every soul in Heaven
Shall bend the knee and in that honour due
Confess him rightful King? unjust thou sayest
Flatly unjust to bind with laws the free
And equal over equals to let reign
One over all with unsucceeded power
Shalt thou give law to God? shalt thou dispute
With him the points of liberty who made
Thee what thou art and formed the Powers of Heaven
Such as he pleased and circumscribed their being?
Yet by experience taught we know how good
And of our good and of our dignity
How provident he is how far from thought
To make us less bent rather to exalt
Our happy state under one head more near
United  But to grant it thee unjust
That equal over equals monarch reign
Thyself though great and glorious dost thou count
Or all angelick nature joined in one
Equal to him begotten Son? by whom
As by his Word the Mighty Father made
All things even thee and all the Spirits of Heaven
By him created in their bright degrees
Crowned them with glory and to their glory named
Thrones Dominations Princedoms Virtues Powers
Essential Powers nor by his reign obscured
But more illustrious made since he the head
One of our number thus reduced becomes
His laws our laws all honour to him done
Returns our own  Cease then this impious rage
And tempt not these but hasten to appease
The incensed Father and the incensed Son
While pardon may be found in time besought
So spake the fervent Angel but his zeal
None seconded as out of season judged
Or singular and rash  Whereat rejoiced
The Apostate and more haughty thus replied
That we were formed then sayest thou? and the work
Of secondary hands by task transferred
From Father to his Son? strange point and new
Doctrine which we would know whence learned who saw
When this creation was? rememberest thou
Thy making while the Maker gave thee being?
We know no time when we were not as now
Know none before us selfbegot selfraised
By our own quickening power when fatal course
Had circled his full orb the birth mature
Of this our native Heaven ethereal sons
Our puissance is our own our own right hand
Shall teach us highest deeds by proof to try
Who is our equal  Then thou shalt behold
Whether by supplication we intend
Address and to begirt the almighty throne
Beseeching or besieging  This report
These tidings carry to the anointed King
And fly ere evil intercept thy flight
He said and as the sound of waters deep
Hoarse murmur echoed to his words applause
Through the infinite host nor less for that
The flaming Seraph fearless though alone
Encompassed round with foes thus answered bold
O alienate from God O Spirit accursed
Forsaken of all good  I see thy fall
Determined and thy hapless crew involved
In this perfidious fraud contagion spread
Both of thy crime and punishment  Henceforth
No more be troubled how to quit the yoke
Of Gods Messiah those indulgent laws
Will not be now vouchsafed other decrees
Against thee are gone forth without recall
That golden scepter which thou didst reject
Is now an iron rod to bruise and break
Thy disobedience  Well thou didst advise
Yet not for thy advice or threats I fly
These wicked tents devoted lest the wrath
Impendent raging into sudden flame
Distinguish not  For soon expect to feel
His thunder on thy head devouring fire
Then who created thee lamenting learn
When who can uncreate thee thou shalt know
So spake the Seraph Abdiel faithful found
Among the faithless faithful only he
Among innumerable false unmoved
Unshaken unseduced unterrified
His loyalty he kept his love his zeal
Nor number nor example with him wrought
To swerve from truth or change his constant mind
Though single  From amidst them forth he passed
Long way through hostile scorn which he sustained
Superiour nor of violence feared aught
And with retorted scorn his back he turned
On those proud towers to swift destruction doomed



Book VI


All night the dreadless Angel unpursued
Through Heavens wide champain held his way till Morn
Waked by the circling Hours with rosy hand
Unbarred the gates of light  There is a cave
Within the mount of God fast by his throne
Where light and darkness in perpetual round
Lodge and dislodge by turns which makes through Heaven
Grateful vicissitude like day and night
Light issues forth and at the other door
Obsequious darkness enters till her hour
To veil the Heaven though darkness there might well
Seem twilight here  And now went forth the Morn
Such as in highest Heaven arrayed in gold
Empyreal from before her vanished Night
Shot through with orient beams when all the plain
Covered with thick embattled squadrons bright
Chariots and flaming arms and fiery steeds
Reflecting blaze on blaze first met his view
War he perceived war in procinct and found
Already known what he for news had thought
To have reported  Gladly then he mixed
Among those friendly Powers who him received
With joy and acclamations loud that one
That of so many myriads fallen yet one
Returned not lost  On to the sacred hill
They led him high applauded and present
Before the seat supreme from whence a voice
From midst a golden cloud thus mild was heard
