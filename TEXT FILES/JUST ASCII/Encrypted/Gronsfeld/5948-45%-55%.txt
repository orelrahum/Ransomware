Preservation as that term is used by archivists was most explicitly
discussed in the context of imaging  Anne KENNEY and Lynne PERSONIUS
explained how the concept of a faithful copy and the userfriendliness of
the traditional book have guided their project at Cornell University
Although interested in computerized dissemination participants in the
Cornell project are creating digital image sets of older books in the
public domain as a source for a fresh paper facsimile or in a future
phase microfilm  The books returned to the library shelves are
highquality and useful replacements on acidfree paper that should last
a long time  To date the Cornell project has placed little or no
emphasis on creating searchable texts one would not be surprised to find
that the project participants view such texts as new editions and thus
not as faithful reproductions

In her talk on preservation Patricia BATTIN struck an ecumenical and
flexible note as she endorsed the creation and dissemination of a variety
of types of digital copies  Do not be too narrow in defining what counts
as a preservation element BATTIN counseled for the present at least
digital copies made with preservation in mind cannot be as narrowly
standardized as say microfilm copies with the same objective  Setting
standards precipitously can inhibit creativity but delay can result in
chaos she advised

In part BATTINs position reflected the unsettled nature of imageformat
standards and attendees could hear echoes of this unsettledness in the
comments of various speakers  For example Jean BARONAS reviewed the
status of several formal standards moving through committees of experts
and Clifford LYNCH encouraged the use of a new guideline for transmitting
document images on Internet  Testimony from participants in the National
Agricultural Librarys NAL Text Digitization Program and LCs American
Memory project highlighted some of the challenges to the actual creation
or interchange of images including difficulties in converting
preservation microfilm to digital form  Donald WATERS reported on the
progress of a master plan for a project at Yale University to convert
books on microfilm to digital image sets Project Open Book POB

The Workshop offered rather less of an imaging practicum than planned
but "howto" hints emerge at various points for example throughout
KENNEYs presentation and in the discussion of arcana such as
thresholding and dithering offered by George THOMA and FLEISCHHAUER

NOTES
       Although there is a sense in which any reproductions of
     historical materials preserve the human record specialists in the
     field have developed particular guidelines for the creation of
     acceptable preservation copies

THE MACHINEREADABLE TEXT  MARKUP AND USE

The sections of the Workshop that dealt with machinereadable text tended
to be more concerned with access and use than with preservation at least
in the narrow technical sense  Michael SPERBERGMcQUEEN made a forceful
presentation on the Text Encoding Initiatives TEI implementation of
the Standard Generalized Markup Language SGML  His ideas were echoed
by Susan HOCKEY Elli MYLONAS and Stuart WEIBEL  While the
presentations made by the TEI advocates contained no practicum their
discussion focused on the value of the finished product what the
European Community calls reusability but what may also be termed
durability  They argued that marking upthat is codinga text in a
wellconceived way will permit it to be moved from one computer
environment to another as well as to be used by various users  Two
kinds of markup were distinguished   procedural markup which
describes the features of a text eg dots on a page and 
descriptive markup which describes the structure or elements of a
document eg chapters paragraphs and front matter

The TEI proponents emphasized the importance of texts to scholarship
They explained how heavily coded and thus analyzed and annotated texts
can underlie research play a role in scholarly communication and
facilitate classroom teaching  SPERBERGMcQUEEN reminded listeners that
a written or printed item eg a particular edition of a book is
merely a representation of the abstraction we call a text  To concern
ourselves with faithfully reproducing a printed instance of the text
SPERBERGMcQUEEN argued is to concern ourselves with the representation
of a representation "images as simulacra for the text"  The TEI proponents
interest in images tends to focus on corollary materials for use in teaching
for example photographs of the Acropolis to accompany a Greek text

By the end of the Workshop SPERBERGMcQUEEN confessed to having been
converted to a limited extent to the view that electronic images
constitute a promising alternative to microfilming indeed an
alternative probably superior to microfilming  But he was not convinced
that electronic images constitute a serious attempt to represent text in
electronic form  HOCKEY and MYLONAS also conceded that their experience
at the Pierce Symposium the previous week at Georgetown University and
the present conference at the Library of Congress had compelled them to
reevaluate their perspective on the usefulness of text as images
Attendees could see that the text and image advocates were in
constructive tension so to say

Three nonTEI presentations described approaches to preparing
machinereadable text that are less rigorous and thus less expensive  In
the case of the Papers of George Washington Dorothy TWOHIG explained
that the digital version will provide a notquiteperfect rendering of
the transcribed textsome  documents available for research
during the decades while the perfect or print version is completed
Members of the American Memory team and the staff of NALs Text
Digitization Program see below also outlined a middle ground concerning
searchable texts  In the case of American Memory contractors produce
texts with about percent accuracy that serve as "browse" or
"reference" versions of written or printed originals  End users who need
faithful copies or perfect renditions must refer to accompanying sets of
digital facsimile images or consult copies of the originals in a nearby
library or archive  American Memory staff argued that the high cost of
producing percent accurate copies would prevent LC from offering
access to large parts of its collections


THE MACHINEREADABLE TEXT  METHODS OF CONVERSION

Although the Workshop did not include a systematic examination of the
methods for converting texts from paper or from facsimile images into
machinereadable form nevertheless various speakers touched upon this
matter  For example WEIBEL reported that OCLC has experimented with a
merging of multiple optical character recognition systems that will
reduce errors from an unacceptable rate of  characters out of every
l to an unacceptable rate of  characters out of every l

Pamela ANDRE presented an overview of NALs Text Digitization Program and
Judith ZIDAR discussed the technical details  ZIDAR explained how NAL
purchased hardware and software capable of performing optical character
recognition OCR and text conversion and used its own staff to convert
texts  The process ZIDAR said required extensive editing and project
staff found themselves considering alternatives including rekeying
andor creating abstracts or summaries of texts  NAL reckoned costs at
 per page  By FIC RK GVWBWIUT AQGND IYFID MZPUIMQJH AQIY IOEAQGDS
