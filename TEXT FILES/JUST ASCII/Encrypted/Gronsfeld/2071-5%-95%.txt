End of The Project Gutenberg Etext of LOC WORKSHOP ON ELECTRONIC ETEXTS


This is the February  Project Gutenberg release of

Paradise Lost by John Milton

The oldest etext known to Project Gutenberg ca 
If you know of any older ones please let us know


Introduction  one page

This etext was originally created in  according to Dr
Joseph Raben of Queens College NY to whom it is attributed by
Project Gutenberg  We had heard of this etext for years but it
was not until  that we actually managed to track it down to
a specific location and then it took months to convince people
to let us have a copy then more months for them actually to do
the copying and get it to us  Then another month to convert to
something we could massage with our favorite  in DOS  After
that is was only a matter of days to get it into this shape you
will see below  The original was of course in CAPS only and
so were all the other etexts of the s and early s  Dont
let anyone fool you into thinking any etext with both upper and
lower case is an original all those original Project Gutenberg
etexts were also in upper case and were translated or rewritten
many times to get them into their current condition  They have
been worked on by many people throughout the world

In the course of our searches for Professor Raben and his etext
we were never able to determine where copies were or which of a
variety of editions he may have used as a source  We did get a
little information here and there but even after we received a
copy of the etext we were unwilling to release it without first
determining that it was in fact Public Domain and finding Raben
to verify this and get his permission  Interested enough in a
totally unrelated action to our searches for him the professor
subscribed to the Project Gutenberg listserver and we happened
by accident to notice his name We dont really look at every
subscription request as the computers usually handle them The
etext was then properly identified copyright analyzed and the
current edition prepared

To give you an estimation of the difference in the original and
what we have today  the original was probably entered on cards
commonly known at the time as "IBM cards" Do Not Fold Spindle
or Mutilate and probably took in excess of  of them  A
single card could hold  characters hence  characters is an
accepted standard for so many computer margins and the entire
original edition we received in all caps was over  chars
in length including line enumeration symbols for caps and tLH
