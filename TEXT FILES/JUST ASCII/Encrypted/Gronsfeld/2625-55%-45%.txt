	And be not proud though all the world could see
	None could be so abused in sight as he
	Come to our flock

	Exeunt ROSALIND CELIA and CORIN

PHEBE	Dead Shepherd now I find thy saw of might
	Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe

PHEBE	                  Ha what sayst thou Silvius?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe pity me

PHEBE	Why I am sorry for thee gentle Silvius

SILVIUS	Wherever sorrow is relief would be
	If you do sorrow at my grief in love
	By giving love your sorrow and my grief
	Were both extermined

PHEBE	Thou hast my love is not that neighbourly?

SILVIUS	I would have you

PHEBE	                  Why that were covetousness
	Silvius the time was that I hated thee
	And yet it is not that I bear thee love
	But since that thou canst talk of love so well
	Thy company which erst was irksome to me
	I will endure and Ill employ thee too
	But do not look for further recompense
	Than thine own gladness that thou art employd

SILVIUS	So holy and so perfect is my love
	And I in such a poverty of grace
	That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
	To glean the broken ears after the man
	That the main harvest reaps loose now and then
	A scatterd smile and that Ill live upon

PHEBE	Knowst now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?

SILVIUS	Not very well but I have met him oft
	And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
	That the old carlot once was master of

PHEBE	Think not I love him though I ask for him
	Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
	But what care I for words? yet words do well
	When he that speaks them pleases those that hear
	It is a pretty youth not very pretty
	But sure hes proud and yet his pride becomes him
	Hell make a proper man the best thing in him
	Is his complexion and faster than his tongue
	Did make offence his eye did heal it up
	He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall
	His leg is but so so and yet tis well
	There was a pretty redness in his lip
	A little riper and more lusty red
	Than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference
	Between the constant red and mingled damask
	There be some women Silvius had they markd him
	In parcels as I did would have gone near
	To fall in love with him but for my part
	I love him not nor hate him not and yet
	I have more cause to hate him than to love him
	For what had he to do to chide at me?
	He said mine eyes were black and my hair black
	And now I am rememberd scornd at me
	I marvel why I answerd not again
	But thats all one omittance is no quittance
	Ill write to him a very taunting letter
	And thou shalt bear it wilt thou Silvius?

SILVIUS	Phebe with all my heart

PHEBE	Ill write it straight
	The matters in my head and in my heart
	I will be bitter with him and passing short
	Go with me Silvius

	Exeunt

ACT IV



SCENE I	The forest


	Enter ROSALIND CELIA and JAQUES

JAQUES	I prithee pretty youth let me be better acquainted
	with thee

ROSALIND	They say you are a melancholy fellow

JAQUES	I am so I do love it better than laughing

ROSALIND	Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
	fellows and betray themselves to every modern
	censure worse than drunkards

JAQUES	Why tis good to be sad and say nothing

ROSALIND	Why then tis good to be a post

JAQUES	I have neither the scholars melancholy which is
	emulation nor the musicians which is fantastical
	nor the courtiers which is proud nor the
	soldiers which is ambitious nor the lawyers
	which is politic nor the ladys which is nice nor
	the lovers which is all these but it is a
	melancholy of mine own compounded of many simples
	extracted from many objects and indeed the sundrys
	contemplation of my travels in which my often
	rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness

ROSALIND	A traveller By my faith you have great reason to
	be sad I fear you have sold your own lands to see
	other mens then to have seen much and to have
	nothing is to have rich eyes and poor hands

JAQUES	Yes I have gained my experience

ROSALIND	And your experience makes you sad I had rather have
	a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
	sad and to travel for it too

	Enter ORLANDO

ORLANDO	Good day and happiness dear Rosalind

JAQUES	Nay then God be wi you an you talk in blank verse

	Exit

ROSALIND	Farewell Monsieur Traveller look you lisp and
	wear strange suits disable all the benefits of your
	own country be out of love with your nativity and
	almost chide God for making you that countenance you
	are or I will scarce think you have swam in a
	gondola Why how now Orlando where have you been
	all this while? You a lover An you serve me such
	another trick never come in my sight more

ORLANDO	My fair Rosalind I come within an hour of my promise

ROSALIND	Break an hours promise in love He that will
	divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
	a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
	affairs of love it may be said of him that Cupid
	hath clapped him o the shoulder but Ill warrant
	him heartwhole

ORLANDO	Pardon me dear Rosalind

ROSALIND	Nay an you be so tardy come no more in my sight I
	had as lief be wooed of a snail

ORLANDO	Of a snail?

ROSALIND	Ay of a snail for though he comes slowly he
	carries his house on his head a better jointure
	I think than you make a woman besides he brings
	his destiny with him

ORLANDO	Whats that?

ROSALIND	Why horns which such as you are fain to be
	beholding to your wives for but he comes armed in
	his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife

ORLANDO	Virtue is no hornmaker and my Rosalind is virtuous

ROSALIND	And I am your Rosalind

CELIA	It pleases him to call you so but he hath a
	Rosalind of a better leer than you

ROSALIND	Come woo me woo me for now I am in a holiday
	humour and like enough to consent What would you
	say to me now an I were your very very Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I would kiss before I spoke

ROSALIND	Nay you were better speak first and when you were
	gravelled for lack of matter you might take
	occasion to kiss Very good orators when they are
	out they will spit and for lovers lackingGod
	warn usmatter the cleanliest shift is to kiss

ORLANDO	How if the kiss be denied?

ROSALIND	Then she puts you to entreaty and there begins new matter

ORLANDO	Who could be out being before his beloved mistress?

ROSALIND	Marry that should you if I were your mistress or
	I should think my honesty ranker than my wit

ORLANDO	What of my suit?

ROSALIND	Not out of your apparel and yet out of your suit
	Am not I your Rosalind?

ORLANDO	I take some joy to say you are because I would be
	talking of her

ROSALIND	Well in her person I say I will not have you

ORLANDO	Then in mine own person I die

ROSALIND	No faith die by attorney The poor world is
	almost six thousand years old and in all this time
	there was not any man died in his own person
	videlicit in a lovecause Troilus had his brains
	dashed out with a Grecian club yet he did what he
	could to die before and he is one of the patterns
	of love Leander he would have lived many a fair
	year though Hero had turned nun if it had not been
	for a hot midsummer night for good youth he went
	but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
	taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
	coroners of that age found it was Hero of Sestos
	But these are all lies men have died from time to
	time and worms have eaten them but not for love

ORLANDO	I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind
	for I protest her frown might kill me

ROSALIND	By this hand it will not kill a fly But come now
	I will be your RoXESRVI QP A VWVH HSTRVLWP
