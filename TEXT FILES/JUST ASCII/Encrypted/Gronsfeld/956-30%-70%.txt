  I dont think they play at all fairly Alice began in rather
a complaining tone and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant
hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in
particular at least if there are nobody attends to themand
youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive
for instance theres the arch Ive got to go through next
walking about at the other end of the groundand I should have
croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now only it ran away when it
saw mine coming

  How do you like the Queen? said the Cat in a low voice

  Not at all said Alice  shes so extremely  Just then
she noticed that the Queen was close behind her listening  so
she went on likely to win that its hardly worth while
finishing the game

  The Queen smiled and passed on

  Who ARE you talking to? said the King going up to Alice and
looking at the Cats head with great curiosity

  Its a friend of minea Cheshire Cat said Alice  allow me
to introduce it

  I dont like the look of it at all said the King  however
it may kiss my hand if it likes

  Id rather not the Cat remarked

  Dont be impertinent said the King and dont look at me
like that  He got behind Alice as he spoke

  A cat may look at a king said Alice  Ive read that in
some book but I dont remember where

  Well it must be removed said the King very decidedly and
he called the Queen who was passing at the moment My dear  I
wish you would have this cat removed

  The Queen had only one way of settling all difficulties great
or small  Off with his head she said without even looking
round

  Ill fetch the executioner myself said the King eagerly and
he hurried off

  Alice thought she might as well go back and see how the game
was going on as she heard the Queens voice in the distance
screaming with passion  She had already heard her sentence three
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns and
she did not like the look of things at all as the game was in
such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or
not  So she went in search of her hedgehog

  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one
of them with the other  the only difficulty was that her
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden where
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
into a tree

  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back
the fight was over and both the hedgehogs were out of sight
but it doesnt matter much thought Alice as all the arches
are gone from this side of the ground  So she tucked it away
under her arm that it might not escape again and went back for
a little more conversation with her friend

  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat she was surprised to
find quite a large crowd collected round it  there was a dispute
going on between the executioner the King and the Queen who
were all talking at once while all the rest were quite silent
and looked very uncomfortable

  The moment Alice appeared she was appealed to by all three to
settle the question and they repeated their arguments to her
though as they all spoke at once she found it very hard indeed
to make out exactly what they said

  The executioners argument was that you couldnt cut off a
head unless there was a body to cut it off from  that he had
never had to do such a thing before and he wasnt going to begin
at HIS time of life

  The Kings argument was that anything that had a head could be
beheaded and that you werent to talk nonsense

  The Queens argument was that if somethinG FIWQY HVWM FJQUC
