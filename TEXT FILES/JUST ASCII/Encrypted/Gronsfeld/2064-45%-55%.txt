     HOOTON opined that both the hardware and the software were highly
     important  Most of the problems discussed today have been solved in
     numerous different ways by other people  Though it is good to be
     cognizant of various experiences this is not to say that it will
     always be thus

      At NAL the throughput rate of the scanning process for paper
     page by page performing OCR ranges from  to  pages per day
     not performing OCR is considerably faster although how much faster
     is not known  This is for scanning from bound books which is much
     slower

      WATERS commented on window management questions  DEC proposed an
     XWindows solution which was problematical for two reasons  One was
     POBs requirement to be able to manipulate images on the workstation
     and bring them down to the workstation itself and the other was
     network usage

                                 


THOMA  Illustration of deficiencies in scanning and storage process 
Image quality in this process  Different costs entailed by better image
quality  Techniques for overcoming various deficiencies  fixed
thresholding dynamic thresholding dithering image merge  Page edge
effects 


George THOMA chief Communications Engineering Branch National Library
of Medicine NLM illustrated several of the deficiencies discussed by
the previous speakers  He introduced the topic of special problems by
noting the advantages of electronic imaging  For example it is regenerable
because it is a coded file and realtime quality control is possible with
electronic capture whereas in photographic capture it is not

One of the difficulties discussed in the scanning and storage process was
image quality which without belaboring the obvious means different
things for maps medical Xrays or broadcast television  In the case of
documents THOMA said image quality boils down to legibility of the
textual parts and fidelity in the case of gray or color photo printtype
material  Legibility boils down to scan density the standard in most
cases being  dpi  Increasing the resolution with scanners that
perform  or  dpi however comes at a cost

Better image quality entails at least four different kinds of costs  
equipment costs because the CCD ie chargecouple device with
greater number of elements costs more   time costs that translate to
the actual capture costs because manual labor is involved the time is
also dependent on the fact that more data has to be moved around in the
machine in the scanning or network devices that perform the scanning as
well as the storage   media costs because at high resolutions larger
files have to be stored and  transmission costs because there is just
more data to be transmitted

But while resolution takes care of the issue of legibility in image
quality other deficiencies have to do with contrast and elements on the
page scanned or the image that needed to be removed or clarified  Thus
THOMA proceeded to illustrate various deficiencies how they are
manifested and several techniques to overcome them

Fixed thresholding was the first technique described suitable for
blackandwhite text when the contrast does not vary over the page  One
can have many different threshold levels in scanning devices  Thus
THOMA offered an example of extremely poor contrast which resulted from
the fact that the stock was a heavy red  This is the sort of image that
when microfilmed fails to provide any legibility whatsoever  Fixed
thresholding is the way to change the blacktored contrast to the
desired blacktowhite contrast

Other examples included material that had been browned or yellowed by
age  This was also a case of contrast deficiency and correction was
done by fixed thresholding  A final example boils down to the same
thing slight variability but it is not significant  Fixed thresholding
solves this problem as well  The microfilm equivalent is certainly legible
but it comes with dark areas  Though THOMA did not have a slide of the
microfilm in this case he did show the reproduced electronic image

When one has variable contrast over a page or the lighting over the page
area varies especially in the case where a bound volume has light
shining on it the image must be processed by a dynamic thresholding
scheme  One scheme dynamic averaging allows the threshold level not to
be fixed but to be recomputed for every pixel from the neighboring
characteristics  The neighbors of a pixel determine where the threshold
should be set for that pixel

THOMA showed an example of a page that had been made deficient by a
variety of techniques including a burn mark coffee stains and a yellow
marker  Application of a fixedthresholding scheme THOMA argued might
take care of several deficiencies on the page but not all of them
Performing the calculation for a dynamic threshold setting however
removes most of the deficiencies so that at least the text is legible

Another problem is representing a gray level with blackandwhite pixels
by a process known as dithering or electronic screening  But dithering
does not provide good image quality for pure blackandwhite textual
material  THOMA illustrated this point with examples Although its
suitability for photoprint is the reason for electronic screening or
dithering it cannot be used for every compound image  In the document
that was distributed by CXP THOMA noticed that the dithered image of the
IEEE test chart evinced some deterioration in the text  He presented an
extreme example of deterioration in the text in which compounded
documents had to be set right by other techniques  The technique
illustrated by the present example was an image merge in which the page
is scanned twice and the settings go from fixed threshold to the
dithering matrix the resulting images are merged to give the best
results with each technique

THOMA illustrated how dithering is also used in nonphotographic or
nonprint materials with an example of a grayish page from a medical text
which was reproduced to show all of the gray that appeared in the
original  Dithering provided a reproduction of all the gray in the
original of another example from the same text

THOMA finally illustrated the problem of bordering or pageedge
effects  Books and bound volumes that are placed on a photocopy machine
or a scanner produce pageedge effects that are undesirable for two
reasons   the aesthetics of the image after all if the image is to
be preserved one does not necessarily want to keep all of its
deficiencies  compression with the bordering problem THOMA
illustrated the compression ratio deteriorated tremendously  One way
to eliminate this more serious problem is to have the operator at the
point of scanning window the part of the image that is desirable and
automatically turn all of the pixels out of that picture to white

                                 


FLEISCHHAUER  AMs experience with scanning bound materials  Dithering



Carl FLEISCHHAUER coordinator American Memory Library of Congress
reported AMs experience with scanning bound materials which he likened
to the problems involved in using photocopying machines  Very few
devices in the industry offer bookedge scanning let alone book cradles
The problem may be unsolvable FLEISCHHAUER said because a large enough
market does not exist for a preservationquality scanner  AM is using a
Kurzweil scanner which is a bookedge scanner now sold by Xerox

Devoting the remainder of his brief presentation to dithering
FLEISCHHAUER related AMs experience with a contractor who was using
unsophisticated equipment and software to reduce moire patterns from
printed halftones  AM took the same image and used the dithering
algorithm that forms part of the same Kurzweil Xerox scanner it
disguised moire patterns much more effectively

FLEISCHHAUER also observed that dithering produces a binary file which is
useful for numerous purposes for example printing it on a laser printer
without having to "rehalftone" it  But it tends to defeat efficient
compression because the very thing that dithers to reduce moire patterns
also tends to work against compression schemes  AM thought the
difference in image quality was worth it

                                 


DISCUSSION  Relative use as a criterion for POBs selection of books to
be converted into digital form 


During the discussion period WATERS noted that one of the criteria for
selecting books among the  to be converted into digital image form
would be how much relative use they would receivea subject still
requiring evaluation  The challenge will be to understand whether
coherent bodies of material will increase usage or whether POB should
seek material that is being used scan that and make it more accessible
POB might decide to digitize materials that are already heavily used in
order to make them more accessible and decrease wear on them  Another
approach would be to provide a large body of intellectually coherent
material that may be used more in digital form than it is currently used
in microfilm  POB would seek material that was out of copyright

                                 


BARONAS  Origin and scope of AIIM  Types of documents produced in
AIIMs standards program  Domain of AIIMs standardization work  AIIMs
structure  TC  and MS  Electronic image management standards 
Categories of EIM standardization where AIIM standards are being
developed 


Jean BARONAS senior manager Department of Standards and Technology
Association for Information and Image Management AIIM described the
notforprofit association and the national and international programs
for standardization in which AIIM is active

Accredited for twentyfive years as the nations standards development
organization for document image management AIIM began life in a library
community developing microfilm standards  Today the association
maintains both its library and businessimage management standardization
activitiesand has moved into electronic imagemanagement
standardization EIM

BARONAS defined the programs scope  AIIM deals with   the
terminology of standards and of the technology it uses  methods of
measurement for the systems as well as quality  methodologies for
users to evaluate and measure quality  the features of apparatus used
to manage and edit images and  the procedures used to manage images

BARONAS noted that three types of documents are produced in the AIIM
standards program  the first two accredited by the American National
Standards Institute ANSI are standards and standard recommended
practices  Recommended practices differ from standards in that they
contain more tutorial information  A technical report is not an ANSI
standard  Because AIIMs policies and procedures for developing
standards are approved by ANSI its standards are labeled ANSIAIIM
followed by the number and title of the standard

BARONAS then illustrated the domain of AIIMs standardization work  For
example AIIM is the administrator of the US Technical Advisory Group
TAG to the International Standards Organizations ISO technical
committee TC ll Micrographics and Optical Memories for Document and
Image Recording Storage and Use  AIIM officially works through ANSI in
the international standardization process

BARONAS described AIIMs structure including its board of directors its
standards board of twelve individuals active in the imagemanagement
industry its strategic planning and legal admissibility task forces and
its National Standards Council which is comprised of the members of a
number of organizations who vote on every AIIM standard before it is
published  BARONAS pointed out that AIIMs liaisons deal with numerous
other standards developers including the optical disk community office
and publishing systems imagecodesandcharacter set committees and the
National Information Standards Organization NISO

BARONAS illustrated the procedures of TC ll which covers all aspects of
image management  When AIIMs national program has conceptualized a new
project it is usually submitted to the international level so that the
member countries of TC ll can simultaneously work on the development of
the standard or the technical report  BARONAS also illustrated a classic
microfilm standard MS which deals with numerous imaging concepts that
apply to electronic imaging  Originally developed in the ls revised
in the ls and revised again in l this standard is scheduled for
another revision  MS is an active standard whereby users may propose
new density ranges and new methods of evaluating film images in the
standards revision

BARONAS detailed several electronic imagemanagement standards for
instance ANSIAIIM MS a qualitycontrol guideline for scanning "
by " blackandwhite office documents  This standard is used with the
IEEE fax imagea continuous tone photographic image with gray scales
text and several continuous tone picturesand AIIM test target number
 a representative document used in office document management

BARONAS next outlined the four categories of EIM standardization in which
AIIM standards are being developed  transfer and retrieval evaluation
optical disc and document scanning applications and design and
conversion of documents  She detailed several of the main projects of
each   in the category of image transfer and retrieval a bilevel
image transfer format ANSIAIIM MS which is a proposed standard that
describes a file header for image transfer between unlike systems when
the images are compressed using G and G compression  the category of
image evaluation which includes the AIIMproposed TR tutorial on image
resolution this technical report will treat the differences and
similarities between classical or photographic and electronic imaging
 design and conversion which includes a proposed technical report
called "Forms Design Optimization for EIM" this report considers how
generalpurpose business forms can be best designed so that scanning is
optimized reprographic characteristics such as type rules background
tint and color will likewise be treated in the technical report 
disk and document scanning applications includes a project a on planning
platters and disk management b on generating an application profile for
EIM when images are stored and distributed on CDROM and c on
evaluating SCSI and how a common command set can be generated for SCSI
so that document scanners are more easily integrated  ANSIAIIM MS
will also apply to compressed images

                                 


BATTIN  The implications of standards for preservation  A major
obstacle to successful cooperation  A hindrance to access in the digital
environment  Standards a doubleedged sword for those concerned with the
preservation of the human record  Nearterm prognosis for reliable
archival standards  Preservation concerns for electronic media  Need
for reconceptualizing our preservation principles  Standards in the real
world and the politics of reproduction  Need to redefine the concept of
archival and to begin to think in terms of life cycles  Cooperation and
the La Guardia Eight  Concerns generated by discussions on the problems
of preserving text and image  General principles to be adopted in a
world without standards 


Patricia BATTIN president the Commission on Preservation and Access
CPA addressed the implications of standards for preservation  She
listed several areas where the library profession and the analog world of
the printed book had made enormous contributions over the past hundred
yearsfor example in bibliographic formats binding standards and most
important in determining what constitutes longevity or archival quality
