	me and I will no longer endure it therefore allow

	Enter CHARLES

CHARLES	Good morrow to your worship

OLIVER	Good Monsieur Charles whats the new news at the
	new court?

CHARLES	Theres no news at the court sir but the old news
	that is the old duke is banished by his younger
	brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
	have put themselves into voluntary exile with him
	whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
	therefore he gives them good leave to wander

OLIVER	Can you tell if Rosalind the dukes daughter be
	banished with her father?

CHARLES	O no for the dukes daughter her cousin so loves
	her being ever from their cradles bred together
	that she would have followed her exile or have died
	to stay behind her She is at the court and no
	less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
	never two ladies loved as they do

OLIVER	Where will the old duke live?

CHARLES	They say he is already in the forest of Arden and
	a many merry men with him and there they live like
	the old Robin Hood of England they say many young
	gentlemen flock to him every day and fleet the time
	carelessly as they did in the golden world

OLIVER	What you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?

CHARLES	Marry do I sir and I came to acquaint you with a
	matter I am given sir secretly to understand
	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
	to come in disguised against me to try a fall
	Tomorrow sir I wrestle for my credit and he that
	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
	well Your brother is but young and tender and
	for your love I would be loath to foil him as I
	must for my own honour if he come in therefore
	out of my love to you I came hither to acquaint you
	withal that either you might stay him from his
	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
	run into in that it is a thing of his own search
	and altogether against my will

OLIVER	Charles I thank thee for thy love to me which
	thou shalt find I will most kindly requite I had
	myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and
	have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
	it but he is resolute Ill tell thee Charles
	it is the stubbornest young fellow of France full
	of ambition an envious emulator of every mans
	good parts a secret and villanous contriver against
	me his natural brother therefore use thy
	discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck
	as his finger And thou wert best look tot for if
	thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
	mightily grace himself on thee he will practise
	against thee by poison entrap thee by some
	treacherous device and never leave thee till he
	hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other
	for I assure thee and almost with tears I speak
	it there is not one so young and so villanous this
	day living I speak but brotherly of him but
	should I anatomize him to thee as he is I must
	blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder

CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you If he come
	tomorrow Ill give him his payment if ever he go
	alone again Ill never wrestle for prize more and
	so God keep your worship

OLIVER	Farewell good Charles

	Exit CHARLES

	Now will I stir this gamester I hope I shall see
	an end of him for my soul yet I know not why
	hates nothing more than he Yet hes gentle never
	schooled and yet learned full of noble device of
	all sorts enchantingly beloved and indeed so much
	in the heart of the world and especially of my own
	people who best know him that I am altogether
	misprised but it shall not bM WR QSUP BMQU
