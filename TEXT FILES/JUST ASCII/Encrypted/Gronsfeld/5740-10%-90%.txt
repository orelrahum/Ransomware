Lebanon Economy

Overview
    Since  civil war has seriously damaged Lebanons economic
    infrastructure cut national output by half and all but ended Lebanons
    position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub Following October
     however a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin
    restoring control in Beirut collect taxes and regain access to key port
    and government facilities The battered economy has also been propped up by
    a financially sound banking system and resilient small and mediumscale
    manufacturers Family remittances banking transactions manufactured and
    farm exports the narcotics trade and international emergency aid are main
    sources of foreign exchange In the relatively settled year of 
    industrial production agricultural output and exports showed substantial
    gains The further rebuilding of the warravaged country could provide a
    major stimulus to the economy in  provided that the political and
    military situation remains reasonably calm
