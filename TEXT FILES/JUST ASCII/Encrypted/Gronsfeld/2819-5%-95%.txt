Greece Economy

Overview
    Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic entrepreneurial
    system overlaid in  by a socialist government that enlarged the
    public sector from  of GDP in  to about  when Prime Minister
    Mitsotakis took office Tourism continues as a major industry and
    agriculture  although handicapped by geographic limitations and fragmented
    small farms  is selfsufficient except for meat dairy products and animal
    feedstuffs The Mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic
    problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations which
    had neglected the runaway budget deficit a ballooning current account
    deficit and accelerating inflation In early  the government secured a
     billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet
    imposed on a member country as the EC finally ran out of patience with
    Greeces failure to put its financial affairs in order Over the next three
    years Athens must bring inflation down to  cut the current account
    deficit and central government borrowing as a percentage of GDP slash
    publicsector employment by  curb publicsector pay raises and broaden
    the tax base
