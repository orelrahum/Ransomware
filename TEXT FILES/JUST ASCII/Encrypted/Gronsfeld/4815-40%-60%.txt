Swaziland Economy

Overview
    The economy is based on subsistence agriculture which occupies most of the
    labor force and contributes nearly  to GDP Manufacturing which includes
    a number of agroprocessing factories accounts for another quarter of GDP
    Mining has declined in importance in recent years highgrade iron ore
    deposits were depleted in  and health concerns cut world demand for
    asbestos Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of
    hard currency Surrounded by South Africa except for a short border with
    Mozambique Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa from which it
    receives  of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports
