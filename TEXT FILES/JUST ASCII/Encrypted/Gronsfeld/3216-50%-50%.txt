May find us both perhaps far less prepared
The willinger I go nor much expect
A foe so proud will first the weaker seek
So bent the more shall shame him his repulse
Thus saying from her husbands hand her hand
Soft she withdrew and like a WoodNymph light
Oread or Dryad or of Delias train
Betook her to the groves but Delias self
In gait surpassed and Goddesslike deport
Though not as she with bow and quiver armed
But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude
Guiltless of fire had formed or Angels brought
To Pales or Pomona thus adorned
Likest she seemed Pomona when she fled
Vertumnus or to Ceres in her prime
Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove
Her long with ardent look his eye pursued
Delighted but desiring more her stay
Oft he to her his charge of quick return
Repeated she to him as oft engaged
To be returned by noon amid the bower
And all things in best order to invite
Noontide repast or afternoons repose
O much deceived much failing hapless Eve
Of thy presumed return event perverse
Thou never from that hour in Paradise
Foundst either sweet repast or sound repose
Such ambush hid among sweet flowers and shades
Waited with hellish rancour imminent
To intercept thy way or send thee back
Despoiled of innocence of faith of bliss
For now and since first break of dawn the Fiend
Mere serpent in appearance forth was come
And on his quest where likeliest he might find
The only two of mankind but in them
The whole included race his purposed prey
In bower and field he sought where any tuft
Of grove or gardenplot more pleasant lay
Their tendance or plantation for delight
By fountain or by shady rivulet
He sought them both but wished his hap might find
Eve separate he wished but not with hope
Of what so seldom chanced WQMR WT LPB ENAJ
