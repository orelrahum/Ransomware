photocopies return the books as soon as they were done with them
perform the keying and return the material to AM on WORM disks

ZIDAR detailed the elements that constitute the previously noted cost of
approximately  per page  Most significant is the editing correction
of errors and spellcheckings which though they may sound easy to
perform require in fact a great deal of time  Reformatting text also
takes a while but a significant amount of NALs expenses are for equipment
which was extremely expensive when purchased because it was one of the few
systems on the market  The costs of equipment are being amortized over
five years but are still quite high nearly  per month

HOCKEY raised a general question concerning OCR and the amount of editing
required substantial in her experience to generate the kind of
structured markup necessary for manipulating the text on the computer or
loading it into any retrieval system  She wondered if the speakers could
extend the previous question about the costbenefit of adding or exerting
structured markup  ERWAY noted that several OCR systems retain italics
bolding and other spatial formatting  While the material may not be in
the format desired these systems possess the ability to remove the
original materials quickly from the hands of the people performing the
conversion as well as to retain that information so that users can work
with it  HOCKEY rejoined that the current thinking on markup is that one
should not say that something is italic or bold so much as why it is that
way  To be sure one needs to know that something was italicized but
how can one get from one to the other?  One can map from the structure to
the typographic representation

FLEISCHHAUER suggested that given the  million items the Library
holds it may not be possible for LC to do more than report that a thing
was in italics as opposed to why it was italics although that may be
desirable in some contexts  Promising to talk a bit during the afternoon
session about several experiments OCLC performed on automatic recognition
of document elements and which they hoped to extend WEIBEL said that in
fact one can recognize the major elements of a document with a fairly
high degree of reliability at least as good as OCR  STEVENS drew a
useful distinction between standard generalized markup ie defining
for a documenttype definition the structure of the document and what
he termed a style sheet which had to do with italics bolding and other
forms of emphasis  Thus two different components are at work one being
the structure of the document itself its logic and the other being its
representation when it is put on the screen or printed

                                 

SESSION V  APPROACHES TO PREPARING ELECTRONIC TEXTS


HOCKEY  Text in ASCII and the representation of electronic text versus
an image  The need to look at ways of using markup to assist retrieval 
The need for an encoding format that will be reusable and multifunctional


Susan HOCKEY director Center for Electronic Texts in the Humanities
CETH Rutgers and Princeton Universities announced that one talk
WEIBELs was moved into this session from the morning and that David
Packard was unable to attend  The session would attempt to focus more on
what one can do with a text in ASCII and the representation of electronic
text rather than just an image what one can do with a computer that
cannot be done with a book or an image  It would be argued that one can
do much more than just read a text and from that starting point one can
use markup and methods of preparing the text to take full advantage of
the capability of the computer  That would lead to a discussion of what
the European Community calls REUSABILITY what may better be termed
DURABILITY that is how to prepare or make a text that will last a long
time and that can be used for as many applications as possible which
would lead to issues of improving intellectual access

HOCKEY urged the need to look at ways of using markup to facilitate retrieval
not just for referencing or to help locate an item that is retrieved but also to put markup tags in
a text to help retrieve the thing sought either with linguistic tagging or
interpretation  HOCKEY also argued that little advancement had occurred in
the software tools currently available for retrieving and searching text
She pressed the desideratum of going beyond Boolean searches and performing
more sophisticated searching which the insertion of more markup in the text
would facilitate  Thinking about electronic texts as opposed to images means
considering material that will never appear in print form or print will not
be its primary form that is material which only appears in electronic form
HOCKEY alluded to the history and the need for markup and tagging and
electronic text which was developed through the use of computers in the
humanities as MICHELSON had observed Father Busa had started in 
to prepare the firstever text on the computer

HOCKEY remarked several large projects particularly in Europe for the
compilation of dictionaries language studies and language analysis in
which people have built up archives of text and have begun to recognize
the need for an encoding format that will be reusable and multifunctional
that can be used not just to print the text which may be assumed to be a
byproduct of what one wants to do but to structure it inside the computer
so that it can be searched built into a Hypertext system etc

                                 


WEIBEL  OCLCs approach to preparing electronic text  retroconversion
keying of texts more automated ways of developing data  Project ADAPT
and the CORE Project  Intelligent character recognition does not exist 
Advantages of SGML  Data should be free of procedural markup
descriptive markup strongly advocated  OCLCs interface illustrated 
Storage requirements and costs for putting a lot of information on line 


Stuart WEIBEL senior research scientist Online Computer Library Center
Inc OCLC described OCLCs approach to preparing electronic text  He
argued that the electronic world into which we are moving must
accommodate not only the future but the past as well and to some degree
even the present  Thus starting out at one end with retroconversion and
keying of texts one would like to move toward much more automated ways
of developing data

For example Project ADAPT had to do with automatically converting
document images into a structured document database with OCR text as
indexing and also a little bit of automatic formatting and tagging of
that text  The CORE project hosted by Cornell University Bellcore
OCLC the American Chemical Society and Chemical Abstracts constitutes
WEIBELs principal concern at the moment  This project is an example of
converting text for which one already has a machinereadable version into
a format more suitable for electronic delivery and database searching
Since Michael LESK had previously described CORE WEIBEL would say
little concerning it  Borrowing a chemical phrase de novo synthesis
WEIBEL cited the Online Journal of Current Clinical Trials as an example
of de novo electronic publishing that is a form in which the primary
form of the information is NTIFYVVWQH
