	dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go

TOUCHSTONE	As the ox hath his bow sir the horse his curb and
	the falcon her bells so man hath his desires and

ACT III



SCENE IV	The forest


	Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

ROSALIND	Never talk to me I will weep

CELIA	Do I prithee but yet have the grace to consider
	that tears do not become a man

ROSALIND	But have I not cause to weep?

CELIA	As good cause as one would desire therefore weep

ROSALIND	His very hair is of the dissembling colour

CELIA	Something browner than Judass marry his kisses are
	Judass own children

ROSALIND	I faith his hair is of a good colour

CELIA	An excellent colour your chestnut was ever the only colour

ROSALIND	And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
	of holy bread

CELIA	He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana a nun
	of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously
	the very ice of chastity is in them

ROSALIND	But why did he swear he would come this morning and
	comes not?

CELIA	Nay certainly there is no truth in him

ROSALIND	Do you think so?

CELIA	Yes I think he is not a pickpurse nor a
	horsestealer but for his verity in love I do
	think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
	wormeaten nut

ROSALIND	Not true in love?

CELIA	Yes when he is in but I think he is not in

ROSALIND	You have heard him swear downright he was

CELIA	Was is not is besides the oath of a lover is
	no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
	both the confirmer of false reckonings He attends
	here in the forest on the duke your father

ROSALIND	I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
	him he asked me of what parentage I was I told
	him of as good as he so he laughed and let me go
	But what talk we of fathers when there is such E
	REU JA TZNAWLS?
