And eaten of the tree concerning which
I charged thee saying Thou shalt not eat thereof
Cursed is the ground for thy sake thou in sorrow
Shalt eat thereof all the days of thy life
Thorns also and thistles it shall bring thee forth
Unbid and thou shalt eat the herb of the field
In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread
Till thou return unto the ground for thou
Out of the ground wast taken know thy birth
For dust thou art and shalt to dust return
So judged he Man both Judge and Saviour sent
And the instant stroke of death denounced that day
Removed far off then pitying how they stood
Before him naked to the air that now
Must suffer change disdained not to begin
Thenceforth the form of servant to assume
As when he washed his servants feet so now
