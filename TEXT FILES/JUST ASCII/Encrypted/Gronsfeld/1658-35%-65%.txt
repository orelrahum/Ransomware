attempting to acquire organize and preserve them are concernedand
preservation would be the most important consideration  In this
connection GIFFORD reiterated the need to work out some sense of
distributive responsibility for a number of these issues which
inevitably will require significant cooperation and discussion
Nobody can do it all

LESK suggested that some publishers may look with favor on LC beginning
to serve as a depository of tapes in an electronic manuscript standard
Publishers may view this as a service that they did not have to perform
and they might send in tapes  However SPERBERGMcQUEEN countered
although publishers have had equivalent services available to them for a
long time the electronic text archive has never turned away or been
flooded with tapes and is forever sending feedback to the depositor
Some publishers do send in tapes

ANDRE viewed this discussion as an allusion to the issue of standards
She recommended that the AAP standard and the TEI which has already been
somewhat harmonized internationally and which also shares several
compatibilities with the AAP be harmonized to ensure sufficient
compatibility in the software  She drew the line at saying LC ought to
be the locus or forum for such harmonization

Taking the group in a slightly different direction but one where at
least in the near term LC might play a helpful role LYNCH remarked the
plans of a number of projects to carry out preservation by creating
digital images that will end up in online or nearline storage at some
institution   Presumably LC will link this material somehow to its
online catalog in most cases  Thus it is in a digital form  LYNCH had
the impression that many of these institutions would be willing to make
those files accessible to other people outside the institution provided
that there is no copyright problem  This desideratum will require
propagating the knowledge that those digitized files exist so that they
can end up in other online catalogs  Although uncertain about the
mechanism for achieving this result LYNCH said that it warranted
scrutiny because it seemed to be connected to some of the basic issues of
cataloging and distribution of records  It would be  foolish given the
amount of work that all of us have to do and our meager resources to
discover multiple institutions digitizing the same work  Re microforms
LYNCH said we are in pretty good shape

BATTIN called this a big problem and noted that the Cornell people who
had already departed were working on it  At issue from the beginning
was to learn how to catalog that information into RLIN and then into
OCLC so that it would be accessible  That issue remains to be resolved
LYNCH rejoined that putting it into OCLC or RLIN was helpful insofar as
somebody who is thinking of performing preservation activity on that work
could learn about it  It is not necessarily helpful for institutions to
make that available  BATTIN opined that the idea was that it not only be
for preservation purposes but for the convenience of people looking for
this material  She endorsed LYNCHs dictum that duplication of this
effort was to be avoided by every means

HOCKEY informed the Workshop about one major current activity of CETH
namely a catalogue of machinereadable texts in the humanities  Held on
RLIN at present the catalogue has been concentrated on ASCII as opposed
to digitized images of text  She is exploring ways to improve the
catalogue and make it more widely available and welcomed suggestions
about these concerns  CETH owns the records which are not just
restricted to RLIN and can distribute them however it wishes

Taking up LESKs earlier question BATTIN inquired whether LC since it
is accepting electronic files and designing a mechanism for dealing with
that rather than putting books on shelves would become responsible for
the National Copyright Depository of Electronic Materials  Of course
that could not be accomplished overnight but it would be something LC
could plan for  GIFFORD acknowledged that much thought was being devoted
to that set of problems and returned the discussion to the issue raised
by LYNCHwhether or not putting the kind of records that both BATTIN and
HOCKEY have been talking about in RLIN is not a satisfactory solution
It seemed to him that RLIN answered LYNCHs original point concerning
some kind of directory for these kinds of materials  In a situation
where somebody is attempting to decide whether or not to scan this or
film that or to learn whether or not someone has already done so LYNCH
suggested RLIN is helpful but it is not helpful in the case of a local
online catalogue  Further one would like to have her or his system be
aware that that exists in digital form so that one can present it to a
patron even though one did not digitize it if it is out of copyright
The only way to make those linkages would be to perform a tremendous
amount of realtime lookup which would be awkward at best or
periodically to yank the whole file from RLIN and match it against ones
own stuff which is a nuisance

But where ERWAY inquired does one stop including things that are
available with Internet for instance in ones local catalogue?
It almost seems that that is LCs means to acquire access to them
That represents LCs new form of library loan  Perhaps LCs new online
catalogue is an amalgamation of all these catalogues on line  LYNCH
conceded that perhaps that was true in the very long term but was not
applicable to scanning in the short term  In his view the totals cited
by Yale  books over perhaps a fouryear period and 
books from Cornell were not big numbers while searching all over
creation for relatively rare occurrences will prove to be less efficient
As GIFFORD wondered if this would not be a separable file on RLIN and
could be requested from them BATTIN interjected that it was easily
accessible to an institution  SEVERTSON pointed out that that file cum
enhancements was available with reference information on CDROM which
makes it a little more available

In HOCKEYs view the real question facing the Workshop is what to put in
this catalogue because that raises the question of what constitutes a
publication in the electronic world  WEIBEL interjected that Eric Joule
in OCLCs Office of Research is also wrestling with this particular
problem while GIFFORD thought it sounded fairly generic  HOCKEY
contended that a majority of texts in the humanities are in the hands
of either a small number of large research institutions or individuals
and are not generally available for anyone else to access at all
She wondered if these texts ought to be catalogued

After argument proceeded back and forth for several minutes over why
cataloguing might be a necessary service LEBRON suggested that this
issue involved the responsibility of a publisher  The fact that someone
has created something electronically and keeps it under his or her
control does not constitute publication  Publication implies
dissemination  While it would be important for a scholar to let other
people know that this creation exists in many respects this is no
different from an unpublished manuscript  That is what is being accessed
in there except that now one is not looking at it in the hardcopy but
in the electronic environment

LEBRON expressed puzzlement at the variety of ways electronic publishing
has been viewed  Much of what has been discussed throughout these two
days has concerned CDROM publishing whereas in the online environment
that she confronts the constraints and challenges are very different
Sooner or later LC will have to deal with the concept of online
publishing  Taking up the comment ERWAY made earlier about storing
copies LEBRON gave her own journal as an example  How would she deposit
OJCCT for copyright? she asked because the journal will exist in the
mainframe at OCLC and people will be able to access it  Here the
situation is different ownership versus access and is something that
arises with publication in the online environment faster than is
sometimes realized  Lacking clear answers to all of these questions
herself LEBRON did not anticipate that LC would be able to take a role
in helping to define some of them for quite a while

GREENFIELD observed that LCs Network Development Office is attempting
among other things to explore the limits of MARC as a standard in terms
of handling electronic information  GREENFIELD also noted that Rebecca
GUENTHER from that office gave a paper to the American Society for
Information Science ASIS summarizing several of the discussion papers
that were coming out of the Network Development Office  GREENFIELD said
he understood that that office had a listserver soliciting just the kind
of feedback received today concerning the difficulties of identifying and
cataloguing electronic information  GREENFIELD hoped that everybody
would be aware of that and somehow contribute to that conversation

Noting two of LCs roles first to act as a repository of record for
material that is copyrighted in this country and second to make
materials it holds available in some limited form to a clientele that
goes beyond Congress BESSER suggested that it was incumbent on LC to
extend those responsibilities to all the things being published in
electronic form  This would mean eventually accepting electronic
formats  LC could require that at some point they be in a certain
limited set of formats and then develop mechanisms for allowing people
to access those in the same way that other things are accessed  This
does not imply that they are on the network and available to everyone
LC does that with most of its bibliographic records BESSER said which
end up migrating to the utility eg OCLC or somewhere else  But just
as most of LCs books are available in some form through interlibrary
loan or some other mechanism so in the same way electronic formats ought
to be available to others in some format though with some copyright
considerations  BESSER was not suggesting that these mechanisms be
established tomorrow only that they seemed to fall within LCs purview
and that there should be longrange plans to establish them

Acknowledging that those from LC in the room agreed with BESSER
concerning the need to confront difficult questions GIFFORD underscored
the magnitude of the problem of what to keep and what to select  GIFFORD
noted that LC currently receives some  items per day not counting
electronic materials and argued for much more distributed responsibility
in order to maintain and store electronic information

BESSER responded that the assembled group could be viewed as a starting
point whose initial operating premise could be helping to move in this
direction and defining how LC could do so for example in areas of
standardization or distribution of responsibility

FLEISCHHAUER added that AM was fully engaged wrestling with some of the
questions that pertain to the conversion of older historical materials
which would be one thing that the Library of Congress might do  Several
points mentioned by BESSER and several others on this question have a
much greater impact on those who are concerned with cataloguing and the
networking of bibliographic information as well as preservation itself

Speaking directly to AM which he considered was a largely uncopyrighted
database LYNCH urged development of a network version of AM or
consideration of making the data in it available to people interested in
doing network multimedia  On account of the current great shortage of
digital data that is both appealing and unencumbered by complex rights
problems this course of action could have a significant effect on making
network multimedia a reality

In this connection FLEISCHHAUER reported on a fragmentary prototype in
LCs Office of Information Technology Services that attempts to associate
digital images of photographs with cataloguing information in ways that
work within a local area networka step so to say toward AMs
construction of some sort of apparatus for access  Further AM has
attempted to use standard data forms in order to help make that
distinction between the access tools and the underlying data and thus
believes that the database is networkable

A delicate and agonizing policy question for LC however which comes
back to resources and unfortunately has an impact on this is to find
some appropriate honorable and legal costrecovery possibilities  A
certain skittishness concerning costrecovery has made people unsure
exactly what to do  AM would be highly receptive to discussing further
LYNCHs offer to test or demonstrate its database in a network
environment FLEISCHHAUER said

Returning the discussion to what she viewed as the vital issue of
electronic deposit BATTIN recommended that LC initiate a catalytic
process in terms of distributed responsibility that is bring together
the distributed organizations and set up a study group to look at all
these issues and see where we as a nation should move  The broader
issues of how we deal with the management of electronic information will
not disappear but only grow worse

LESK took up this theme and suggested that LC attempt to persuade one
major library in each state to deal with its state equivalent publisher
which might produce a cooperative project that would be equitably
distributed around the country and one in which LC would be dealing with
a minimal number of publishers and minimal copyright problems

GRABER remarked the recent development in the scientific community of a
willingness to use SGML and either deposit or interchange on a fairly
standardized format  He wondered if a similar movement was taking place
in the humanities  Although the National Library of Medicine found only
a few publishers to cooperate in a like venture two or three years ago a
new effort might generate a much larger number willing to cooperate

KIMBALL recounted his units MachineReadable Collections Reading Room
troubles with the commercial publishers of electronic media in acquiring
materials for LCs collections in particular the publishers fear that
they would not be able to cover their costs and would lose control of
their products that LC would give them away or sell them and make
profits from them  He doubted that the publishing industry was prepared
to move into this area at the moment given its resistance to allowing LC
to use its machinereadable materials as the Library would like

The copyright law now addresses compact disk as a medium and LC can
request one copy of that or two copies if it is the only version and
can request copies of software but that fails to address magazines or
books or anything like that which is in machinereadable form

GIFFORD acknowledged the thorny nature of this issue which he illustrated
with the example of the cumbersome process involved in putting a copy of a
scientific database on a LAN in LCs science reading room  He also
acknowledged that LC needs help and could enlist the energies and talents
of Workshop participants in thinking through a number of these problems

GIFFORD returned the discussion to getting the image and text people to
think through together where they want to go in the long term  MYLONAS
conceded that her experience at the Pierce Symposium the previous week at
Georgetown University and this week at LC had forced her to reevaluate
her perspective on the usefulness of text as images  MYLONAS framed the
issues in a series of questions  How do we acquire machinereadable
text?  Do we take pictures of it and perform OCR on it later?  Is it
important to obtain very highquality images and text etc?
FLEISCHHAUER agreed with MYLONASs framing of strategic questions adding
that a large institution such as LC probably has to do all of those
things at different times  Thus the trick is to exercise judgment  The
Workshop had added to his and AMs considerations in making those
judgments  Concerning future meetings or discussions MYLONAS suggested
that screening priorities would be helpful

WEIBEL opined that the diversity reflected in this group was a sign both
of the health and of the immaturity of the field and more time would
have to pass before we convince one another concerning standards

An exchange between MYLONAS and BATTIN clarified the point that the
driving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects was
the preservation of knowledge for the future not simply for particular
research use  In the case of Perseus MYLONAS said the assumption was
that the texts would not be entered again into electronically readable
form  SPERBERGMcQUEEN added that a scanned image would not serve as an
archival copy for purposes of preservation in the case of say the Bill
of Rights in the sense that the scanned images are effectively the
archival copies for the Cornell mathematics books

SESSION I

Avra MICHELSON           Forecasting the Use of Electronic Texts by
                         Social Sciences and Humanities Scholars

This presentation explores the ways in which electronic texts are likely
to be used by the nonscientific scholarly community  Many of the
remarks are drawn from a report the speaker coauthored with Jeff
Rothenberg a computer scientist at The RAND Corporation

The speaker assesses  current scholarly use of information technology
and  the key trends in information technology most relevant to the
research process in order to predict how social sciences and humanities
scholars are apt to use electronic texts  In introducing the topic
current use of electronic texts is explored broadly within the context of
scholarly communication  From the perspective of scholarly
communication the work of humanities and social sciences scholars
involves five processes   identification of sources  communication
with colleagues  interpretation and analysis of data  dissemination
of research findings and  curriculum development and instruction  The
extent to which computation currently permeates aspects of scholarly
communication represents a viable indicator of the prospects for
electronic texts

The discussion of current practice is balanced by an analysis of key
trends in the scholarly use of information technology  These include the
trends toward enduser computing and connectivity which provide a
framework for forecasting the use of electronic texts through this
millennium  The presentation concludes with a summary of the ways in
which the nonscientific scholarly community can be expected to use
electronic texts and the implications of that use for information
providers

Susan VECCIA and Joanne FREEMAN    Electronic Archives for the Public
                                   Use of American Memory in Public and
                                   School Libraries

This joint discussion focuses on nonscholarly applications of electronic
library materials specifically addressing use of the Library of Congress
American Memory AM program in a small number of public and school
libraries throughout the United States  AM consists of selected Library
of Congress primary archival materials stored on optical media
CDROMvideodisc and presented with little or no editing  Many
collections are accompanied by electronic introductions and users guides
offering background information and historical context  Collections
represent a variety of formats including photographs graphic arts
motion pictures recorded sound music broadsides and manuscripts
books and pamphlets

In  the Library of Congress began a nationwide evaluation of AM in
different types of institutions  Test sites include public libraries
elementary and secondary school libraries college and university
libraries state libraries and special libraries  Susan VECCIA and
Joanne FREEMAN will discuss their observations on the use of AM by the
nonscholarly community using evidence gleaned from this ongoing
evaluation effort

VECCIA will comment on the overall goals of the evaluation project and
the types of public and school libraries included in this study  Her
comments on nonscholarly use of AM will focus on the public library as a
cultural and community institution often bridging the gap between formal
and informal education  FREEMAN will discuss the use of AM in school
libraries  Use by students and teachers has revealed some broad
questions about the use of electronic resources as well as definite
benefits gained by the "nonscholar"  Topics will include the problem of
grasping content and context in an electronic environment the stumbling
blocks created by "new" technologies and the unique skills and interests
awakened through use of electronic resources

SESSION II

Elli MYLONAS             The Perseus Project  Interactive Sources and
                         Studies in Classical Greece

The Perseus Project  has just released Perseus  the first publicly
available version of its hypertextual database of multimedia materials on
classical Greece  Perseus is designed to be used by a wide audience
comprised of readers at the student and scholar levels  As such it must
be able to locate information using different strategies and it must
contain enough detail to serve the different needs of its users  In
addition it must be delivered so that it is affordable to its target
audience  These problems and the solutions we chose are described in
Mylonas "An Interface to Classical Greek Civilization" JASIS 
March 

In order to achieve its objective the project staff decided to make a
conscious separation between selecting and converting textual database
and image data on the one hand and putting it into a delivery system on
the other  That way it is possible to create the electronic data
without thinking about the restrictions of the delivery system  We have
made a great effort to choose systemindependent formats for our data
and to put as much thought and work as possible into structuring it so
that the translation from paper to electronic form will enhance the value
of the data A discussion of these solutions as of two years ago is in
Elli Mylonas Gregory Crane Kenneth Morrell and D Neel Smith "The
Perseus Project  Data in the Electronic Age" in Accessing Antiquity
The Computerization of Classical Databases J Solomon and T Worthen
eds  University of Arizona Press in press

Much of the work on Perseus is focused on collecting and converting the
data on which the project is based  At the same time it is necessary to
provide means of access to the information in order to make it usable
and them to investigate how it is used  As we learn more about what
students and scholars from different backgrounds do with Perseus we can
adjust our data collection and also modify the system to accommodate
them  In creating a delivery system for general use we have tried to
avoid favoring any one type of use by allowing multiple forms of access
to and navigation through the system

The way text is handled exemplifies some of these principles  All text
in Perseus is tagged using SGML following the guidelines of the Text
Encoding Initiative TEI  This markup is used to index the text and
process it so that it can be imported into HyperCard  No SGML markup
remains in the text that reaches the user because currently it would be
too expensive to create a system that acts on SGML in real time
However the regularity provided by SGML is essential for verifying the
content of the texts and greatly speeds all the processing performed on
them  The fact that the texts exist in SGML ensures that they will be
relatively easy to port to different hardware and software and so will
outlast the current delivery platform  Finally the SGML markup
incorporates existing canonical reference systems chapter verse line
etc indexing and navigation are based on these features  This ensures
that the same canonical reference will always resolve to the same point
within a text and that all versions of our texts regardless of delivery
platform even paper printouts will function the same way

In order to provide tools for users the text is processed by a
morphological analyzer and the results are stored in a database
Together with the index the GreekEnglish Lexicon and the index of all
the English words in the definitions of the lexicon the morphological
analyses comprise a set of linguistic tools that allow users of all
levels to work with the textual information and to accomplish different
tasks  For example students who read no Greek may explore a concept as
it appears in Greek texts by using the EnglishGreek index and then
looking up works in the texts and translations or scholars may do
detailed morphological studies of word use by using the morphological
analyses of the texts  Because these tools were not designed for any one
use the same tools and the same data can be used by both students and
scholars

ChadwyckHealey embarked last year on two distinct yet related fulltext
humanities database projects

The English Poetry FullText Database and the Patrologia Latina Database
represent new approaches to linguistic research resources  The size and
complexity of the projects present problems for electronic publishers
but surmountable ones if they remain abreast of the latest possibilities
in data capture and retrieval software techniques

The issues which required address prior to the commencement of the
projects were legion

        Editorial selection or exclusion of materials in each
          database

        Deciding whether or not to incorporate a normative encoding
          structure into the databases?
               A  If one is selected should it be SGML?
               B  If SGML then the TEI?

        Deliver as CDROM magnetic tape or both?

        Can one produce retrieval software advanced enough for the
          postdoctoral linguist yet accessible enough for unattended
          general use?  Should one try?

        Re fair and liberal networking policies what are the risks to
          an electronic publisher?

        How does the emergence of national and international education
          networks affect the use and viability of research projects
          requiring high investment?  Do the new European Community
          directives concerning database protection necessitate two
          distinct publishing projects one for North America and one for
          overseas?

From new notions of "scholarly fair use" to the future of optical media
virtually every issue related to electronic publishing was aired  The
result is two projects which have been constructed to provide the quality
research resources with the fewest encumbrances to use by teachers and
private scholars

Dorothy TWOHIG

In spring  the editors of the papers of George Washington John
Adams Thomas Jefferson James Madison and Benjamin Franklin were
approached by classics scholar David Packard on behalf of the Packard
Humanities Foundation with a proposal to produce a CDROM edition of the
complete papers of each of the Founding Fathers  This electronic edition
will supplement the published volumes making the documents widely
available to students and researchers at reasonable cost  We estimate
that our CDROM edition of Washingtons Papers will be substantially
completed within the next two years and ready for publication  Within
the next ten years or so similar CDROM editions of the Franklin Adams
Jefferson and Madison papers also will be available  At the Library of
Congresss session on technology I would like to discuss not only the
experience of the Washington Papers in producing the CDROM edition but
the impact technology has had on these major editorial projects
Already we are editing our volumes with an eye to the material that will
be readily available in the CDROM edition  The completed electronic
edition will provide immense possibilities for the searching of documents
for information in a way never possible before  The kind of technical
innovations that are currently available and on the drawing board will
soon revolutionize historical research and the production of historical
documents  Unfortunately much of this new technology is not being used
in the planning stages of historical projects simply because many
historians are aware only in the vaguest way of its existence  At least
two major new historical editing projects are considering microfilm
editions simply because they are not aware of the possibilities of
electronic alternatives and the advantages of the new technology in terms
of flexibility and research potential compared to microfilm  In fact
too many of us in history and literature are still at the stage of
struggling with our PCs  There are many historical editorial projects in
progress presently and an equal number of literary projects  While the
two fields have somewhat different approaches to textual editing there
are ways in which electronic technology can be of service to both

Since few of the editors involved in the Founding Fathers CDROM editions
are technical experts in any sense I hope to point out in my discussion
of our experience how many of these electronic innovations can be used
successfully by scholars who are novices in the world of new technology
One of the major concerns of the sponsors of the multitude of new
scholarly editions is the limited audience reached by the published
volumes  Most of these editions are being published in small quantities
and the publishers price for them puts them out of the reach not only of
individual scholars but of most public libraries and all but the largest
educational institutions  However little attention is being given to
ways in which technology can bypass conventional publication to make
historical and literary documents more widely available

What attracted us most to the CDROM edition of The Papers of George
Washington was the fact that David Packards aim was to make a complete
edition of all of the  documents we have collected available in an
inexpensive format that would be placed in public libraries small
colleges and even high schoolV  YLPB ETCND YZSYNHL JV FCFINVGH KEY
