Conspicuous far winding with one ascent
Accessible from earth one entrance high
The rest was craggy cliff that overhung
Still as it rose impossible to climb
Betwixt these rocky pillars Gabriel sat
Chief of the angelick guards awaiting night
About him exercised heroick games
The unarmed youth of Heaven but nigh at hand
Celestial armoury shields helms and spears
Hung high with diamond flaming and with gold
Thither came Uriel gliding through the even
On a sunbeam swift as a shooting star
In autumn thwarts the night when vapours fired
Impress the air and shows the mariner
From what point of his compass to beware
Impetuous winds  He thus began in haste
Gabriel to thee thy course by lot hath given
Charge and strict watch that to this happy place
No evil thing approach or enter in
This day at highth of noon came to my sphere
A Spirit zealous as he seemed to know
More of the Almightys works and chiefly Man
Gods latest image  I described his way
Bent all on speed and marked his aery gait
But in the mount that lies from Eden north
Where he first lighted soon discerned his looks
Alien from Heaven with passions foul obscured
Mine eye pursued him still but under shade
Lost sight of him  One of the banished crew
I fear hath ventured from the deep to raise
New troubles him thy care must be to find
To whom the winged warriour thus returned
Uriel no wonder if thy perfect sight
Amid the suns bright circle where thou sitst
See far and wide  In at this gate none pass
The vigilance here placed but such as come
Well known from Heaven and since meridian hour
No creature thence  If Spirit of other sort
So minded have oerleaped these earthly bounds
On purpose hard thou knowest it to exclude
Spiritual substance with corporeal bar
But if within the circuit of these walks
In whatsoever shape he lurk of whom
Thou tellest by morrow dawning I shall know
So promised he and Uriel to his charge
Returned on that bright beam whose point now raised
Bore him slope downward to the sun now fallen
Beneath the Azores whether the prime orb
Incredible how swift had thither rolled
Diurnal or this less volubil earth
By shorter flight to the east had left him there
Arraying with reflected purple and gold
The clouds that on his western throne attend
Now came still Evening on and Twilight gray
Had in her sober livery all things clad
Silence accompanied for beast and bird
They to their grassy couch these to their nests
Were slunk all but the wakeful nightingale
She all night long her amorous descant sung
Silence was pleased  Now glowed the firmament
With living sapphires  Hesperus that led
The starry host rode brightest till the moon
Rising in clouded majesty at length
Apparent queen unveiled her peerless light
And oer the dark her silver mantle threw
When Adam thus to Eve  Fair Consort the hour
Of night and all things now retired to rest
Mind us of like repose since God hath set
Labour and rest as day and night to men
Successive and the timely dew of sleep
Now falling with soft slumbrous weight inclines
Our eyelids  Other creatures all day long
Rove idle unemployed and less need rest
Man hath his daily work of body or mind
Appointed which declares his dignity
And the regard of Heaven on all his ways
While other animals unactive range
And of their doings God takes no account
Tomorrow ere fresh morning streak the east
With first approach of light we must be risen
And at our pleasant labour to reform
Yon flowery arbours yonder alleys green
Our walk at noon with branches overgrown
That mock our scant manuring and require
More hands than ours to lop their wanton growth
Those blossoms also and those dropping gums
That lie bestrown unsightly and unsmooth
Ask riddance if we mean to tread with ease
Mean while as Nature wills night bids us rest
To whom thus Eve with perfect beauty adorned
My Author and Disposer what thou bidst
Unargued I obey  So God ordains
God is thy law thou mine  To know no more
Is womans happiest knowledge and her praise
With thee conversing I forget all time
All seasons and their change all please alike
Sweet is the breath of Morn her rising sweet
With charm of earliest birds  pleasant the sun
When first on this delightful land he spreads
His orient beams on herb tree fruit and flower
Glistering with dew fragrant the fertile earth
After soft showers and sweet the coming on
Of grateful Evening mild then silent Night
With this her solemn bird and this fair moon
And these the gems of Heaven her starry train
But neither breath of Morn when she ascends
With charm of earliest birds nor rising sun
On this delightful land nor herb fruit flower
Glistering with dew nor fragrance after showers
Nor grateful Evening mild nor silent Night
With this her solemn bird nor walk by moon
Or glittering starlight without thee is sweet
But wherefore all night long shine these? for whom
This glorious sight when sleep hath shut all eyes?
To whom our general ancestor replied
Daughter of God and Man accomplished Eve
These have their course to finish round the earth
By morrow evening and from land to land
In order though to nations yet unborn
Ministring light prepared they set and rise
Lest total Darkness should by night regain
Her old possession and extinguish life
In Nature and all things which these soft fires
Not only enlighten but with kindly heat
Of various influence foment and warm
Temper or nourish or in part shed down
Their stellar virtue on all kinds that grow
On earth made hereby apter to receive
Perfection from the suns more potent ray
These then though unbeheld in deep of night
Shine not in vain nor think though men were none
That Heaven would want spectators God want praise
Millions of spiritual creatures walk the earth
Unseen both when we wake and when we sleep
All these with ceaseless praise his works behold
Both day and night  How often from the steep
Of echoing hill or thicket have we heard
Celestial voices to the midnight air
Sole or responsive each to others note
Singing their great Creator? oft in bands
While they keep watch or nightly rounding walk
With heavenly touch of instrumental sounds
In full harmonick number joined their songs
Divide the night and lift our thoughts to Heaven
Thus talking hand in hand alone they passed
On to their blissful bower it was a place
Chosen by the sovran Planter when he framed
All things to Mans delightful use the roof
Of thickest covert was inwoven shade
Laurel and myrtle and what higher grew
Of firm and fragrant leaf on either side
Acanthus and each odorous bushy shrub
Fenced up the verdant wall each beauteous flower
Iris all hues roses and jessamin
Reared high their flourished heads between and wrought
Mosaick underfoot the violet
Crocus and hyacinth with rich inlay
Broidered the ground more coloured than with stone
Of costliest emblem  Other creature here
Bird beast insect or worm durst enter none
Such was their awe of Man  In shadier bower
More sacred and sequestered though but feigned
Pan or Sylvanus never slept nor Nymph
Nor Faunus haunted  Here in close recess
With flowers garlands and sweetsmelling herbs
Espoused Eve decked first her nuptial bed
And heavenly quires the hymenaean sung
What day the genial Angel to our sire
Brought her in naked beauty more adorned
More lovely than Pandora whom the Gods
Endowed with all their gifts and O too like
In sad event when to the unwiser son
Of Japhet brought by Hermes she ensnared
Mankind with her fair looks to be avenged
On him who had stole Joves authentick fire
Thus at their shady lodge arrived both stood
Both turned and under open sky adored
The God that made both sky air earth and heaven
Which they beheld the moons resplendent globe
And starry pole  Thou also madest the night
Maker Omnipotent and thou the day
Which we in our appointed work employed
Have finished happy in our mutual help
And mutual love the crown of all our bliss
Ordained by thee and this delicious place
For us too large where thy abundance wants
Partakers and uncropt falls to the ground
But thou hast promised from us two a race
To fill the earth who shall with us extol
Thy goodness infinite both when we wake
And when we seek as now thy gift of sleep
This said unanimous and other rites
Observing none but adoration pure
Which God likes best into their inmost bower
Handed they went and eased the putting off
These troublesome disguises which we wear
Straight side by side were laid nor turned I ween
Adam from his fair spouse nor Eve the rites
Mysterious of connubial love refused
Whatever hypocrites austerely talk
Of purity and place and innocence
Defaming as impure what God declares
Pure and commands to some leaves free to all
Our Maker bids encrease who bids abstain
But our Destroyer foe to God and Man?
Hail wedded Love mysterious law true source
Of human offspring sole propriety
In Paradise of all things common else
By thee adulterous Lust was driven from men
Among the bestial herds to range by thee
Founded in reason loyal just and pure
Relations dear and all the charities
Of father son and brother first were known
Far be it that I should write thee sin or blame
Or think thee unbefitting holiest place
Perpetual fountain of domestick sweets
Whose bed is undefiled and chaste pronounced
Present or past as saints and patriarchs used
Here Love his golden shafts employs here lights
His constant lamp and waves his purple wings
Reigns here and revels not in the bought smile
Of harlots loveless joyless unendeared
Casual fruition nor in courtamours
Mixed dance or wanton mask or midnight ball
Or serenate which the starved lover sings
To his proud fair best quitted with disdain
These lulled by nightingales embracing slept
And on their naked limbs the flowery roof
Showered roses which the morn repaired  Sleep on
Blest pair and Oyet happiest if ye seek
No happier state and know to know no more
Now had night measured with her shadowy cone
Half way up hill this vast sublunar vault
And from their ivory port the Cherubim
Forth issuing at the accustomed hour stood armed
To their night watches in warlike parade
When Gabriel to his next in power thus spake
Uzziel half these draw off and coast the south
With strictest watch these other wheel the north
Our circuit meets full west  As flame they part
Half wheeling to the shield half to the spear
From these two strong and subtle Spirits he called
That near him stood and gave them thus in charge
Ithuriel and Zephon with winged speed
Search through this garden leave unsearched no nook
But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge
Now laid perhaps asleep secure of harm
This evening from the suns decline arrived
Who tells of some infernal Spirit seen
Hitherward bent who could have thought? escaped
The bars of Hell on errand bad no doubt
Such where ye find seise fast and hither bring
So saying on he led his radiant files
Dazzling the moon these to the bower direct
In search of whom they sought  Him there they found
Squat like a toad close at the ear of Eve
Assaying by his devilish art to reach
The organs of her fancy and with them forge
Illusions as he list phantasms and dreams
Or if inspiring venom he might taint
The animal spirits that from pure blood arise
Like gentle breaths from rivers pure thence raise
At least distempered discontented thoughts
Vain hopes vain aims inordinate desires
Blown up with high conceits ingendering pride
Him thus intent Ithuriel with his spear
Touched lightly for no falshood can endure
Touch of celestial temper but returns
Of force to its own likeness  Up he starts
Discovered and surprised  As when a spark
Lights on a heap of nitrous powder laid
Fit for the tun some magazine to store
Against a rumoured war the smutty grain
With sudden blaze diffused inflames the air
So started up in his own shape the Fiend
Back stept those two fair Angels half amazed
So sudden to behold the grisly king
Yet thus unmoved with fear accost him soon
Which of those rebel Spirits adjudged to Hell
Comest thou escaped thy prison? and transformed
Why satst thou like an enemy in wait
Here watching at the head of these that sleep?
Know ye not then said Satan filled with scorn
Know ye not me? ye knew me once no mate
For you there sitting where ye durst not soar
Not to know me argues yourselves unknown
The lowest of your throng or if ye know
Why ask ye and superfluous begin
Your message like to end as much in vain?
To whom thus Zephon answering scorn with scorn
Think not revolted Spirit thy shape the same
Or undiminished brightness to be known
As when thou stoodest in Heaven upright and pure
That glory then when thou no more wast good
Departed from thee and thou resemblest now
Thy sin and place of doom obscure and foul
But come for thou be sure shalt give account
To him who sent us whose charge is to keep
This place inviolable and these from harm
So spake the Cherub and his grave rebuke
Severe in youthful beauty added grace
Invincible  Abashed the Devil stood
And felt how awful goodness is and saw
Virtue in her shape how lovely saw and pined
His loss but chiefly to find here observed
His lustre visibly impaired yet seemed
Undaunted  If I must contend said he
Best with the best the sender not the sent
Or all at once more glory will be won
Or less be lost  Thy fear said Zephon bold
Will save us trial what the least can do
Single against thee wicked and thence weak
The Fiend replied not overcome with rage
But like a proud steed reined went haughty on
Champing his iron curb  To strive or fly
He held it vain awe from above had quelled
His heart not else dismayed  Now drew they nigh
The western point where those halfrounding guards
Just met and closing stood in squadron joined
A waiting next command  To whom their Chief
Gabriel from the front thus called aloud
O friends  I hear the tread of nimble feet
Hasting this way and now by glimpse discern
Ithuriel and Zephon through the shade
And with them comes a third of regal port
But faded splendour wan who by his gait
And fierce demeanour seems the Prince of Hell
Not likely to part hence without contest
Stand firm for in his look defiance lours
He scarce had ended when those two approached
And brief related whom they brought where found
How busied in what form and posture couched
To whom with stern regard thus Gabriel spake
Why hast thou Satan broke the bounds prescribed
To thy transgressions and disturbed the charge
Of others who approve not to transgress
By thy example but have power and right
To question thy bold entrance on this place
Employed it seems to violate sleep and those
Whose dwelling God hath planted here in bliss
To whom thus Satan with contemptuous brow
Gabriel? thou hadst in Heaven the esteem of wise
And such I held thee but this question asked
Puts me in doubt  Lives there who loves his pain
Who would not finding way break loose from Hell
Though thither doomed  Thou wouldst thyself no doubt
And boldly venture to whatever place
Farthest from pain where thou mightst hope to change
Torment with ease and soonest recompense
Dole with delight which in this place I sought
To thee no reason who knowest only good
But evil hast not tried and wilt object
His will who bounds us  Let him surer bar
His iron gates if he intends our stay
In that dark durance  Thus much what was asked
The rest is true they found me where they say
But that implies not violence or harm
Thus he in scorn  The warlike Angel moved
Disdainfully half smiling thus replied
O loss of one in Heaven to judge of wise
Since Satan fell whom folly overthrew
And now returns him from his prison scaped
Gravely in doubt whether to hold them wise
Or not who ask what boldness brought him hither
Unlicensed from his bounds in Hell prescribed
So wise he judges it to fly from pain
However and to scape his punishment
So judge thou still presumptuous till the wrath
Which thou incurrest by flying meet thy flight
Sevenfold and scourge that wisdom back to Hell
Which taught thee yet no better that no pain
Can equal anger infinite provoked
But wherefore thou alone? wherefore with thee
Came not all hell broke loose? or thou than they
Less hardy to endure?  Courageous Chief
The first in flight from pain hadst thou alleged
To thy deserted host this cause of flight
Thou surely hadst not come sole fugitive
To which the Fiend thus answered frowning stern
Not that I less endure or shrink from pain
Insulting Angel well thou knowest I stood
Thy fiercest when in battle to thy aid
The blasting vollied thunder made all speed
And seconded thy else not dreaded spear
But still thy words at random as before
Argue thy inexperience what behoves
From hard assays and ill successes past
A faithful leader not to hazard all
Through ways of danger by himself untried
I therefore I alone first undertook
To wing the desolate abyss and spy
This new created world whereof in Hell
Fame is not silent here in hope to find
Better abode and my afflicted Powers
To settle here on earth or in mid air
Though for possession put to try once more
What thou and thy gay legions dare against
Whose easier business were to serve their Lord
High up in Heaven with songs to hymn his throne
And practised distances to cringe not fight
To whom the warriour Angel soon replied
To say and straight unsay pretending first
Wise to fly pain professing next the spy
Argues no leader but a liear traced
Satan and couldst thou faithful add?  O name
O sacred name of faithfulness profaned
Faithful to whom? to thy rebellious crew?
Army of Fiends fit body to fit head
Was this your discipline and faith engaged
Your military obedience to dissolve
Allegiance to the acknowledged Power supreme?
And thou sly hypocrite who now wouldst seem
Patron of liberty who more than thou
Once fawned and cringed and servily adored
Heavens awful Monarch? wherefore but in hope
To dispossess him and thyself to reign?
But mark what I arreed thee now Avant
Fly neither whence thou fledst  If from this hour
Within these hallowed limits thou appear
Back to the infernal pit I drag thee chained
And seal thee so as henceforth not to scorn
The facile gates of Hell too slightly barred
So threatened he but Satan to no threats
Gave heed but waxing more in rage replied
Then when I am thy captive talk of chains
Proud limitary Cherub but ere then
Far heavier load thyself expect to feel
From my prevailing arm though Heavens King
Ride on thy wings and thou with thy compeers
Usd to the yoke drawest his triumphant wheels
In progress through the road of Heaven starpaved
While thus he spake the angelick squadron bright
Turned fiery red sharpening in mooned horns
Their phalanx and began to hem him round
With ported spears as thick as when a field
Of Ceres ripe for harvest waving bends
Her bearded grove of ears which way the wind
Sways them the careful plowman doubting stands
Left on the threshing floor his hopeless sheaves
Prove chaff  On the other side Satan alarmed
Collecting all his might dilated stood
Like Teneriff or Atlas unremoved
His stature reached the sky and on his crest
Sat Horrour plumed nor wanted in his grasp
What seemed both spear and shield  Now dreadful deeds
Might have ensued nor only Paradise
In this commotion but the starry cope
Of Heaven perhaps or all the elements
At least had gone to wrack disturbed and torn
With violence of this conflict had not soon
The Eternal to prevent such horrid fray
Hung forth in Heaven his golden scales yet seen
Betwixt Astrea and the Scorpion sign
Wherein all things created first he weighed
The pendulous round earth with balanced air
In counterpoise now ponders all events
Battles and realms  In these he put two weights
The sequel each of parting and of fight
The latter quick up flew and kicked the beam
Which Gabriel spying thus bespake the Fiend
Satan I know thy strength and thou knowest mine
Neither our own but given  What folly then
To boast what arms can do? since thine no more
Than Heaven permits nor mine though doubled now
To trample thee as mire  For proof look up
And read thy lot in yon celestial sign
Where thou art weighed and shown how light how weak
If thou resist  The Fiend looked up and knew
His mounted scale aloft  Nor morebut fled
Murmuring and with him fled the shades of night



Book V


Now Morn her rosy steps in the eastern clime
Advancing sowed the earth with orient pearl
When Adam waked so customed for his sleep
Was aerylight from pure digestion bred
And temperate vapours bland which the only sound
Of leaves and fuming rills Auroras fan
Lightly dispersed and the shrill matin song
Of birds on every bough so much the more
His wonder was to find unwakened Eve
With tresses discomposed and glowing cheek
As through unquiet rest  He on his side
Leaning half raised with looks of cordial love
Hung over her enamoured and beheld
Beauty which whether waking or asleep
Shot forth peculiar graces then with voice
Mild as when Zephyrus on Flora breathes
