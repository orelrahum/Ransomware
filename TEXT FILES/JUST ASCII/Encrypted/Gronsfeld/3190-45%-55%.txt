JAQUES	All the worlds a stage
	And all the men and women merely players
	They have their exits and their entrances
	And one man in his time plays many parts
	His acts being seven ages At first the infant
	Mewling and puking in the nurses arms
	And then the whining schoolboy with his satchel
	And shining morning face creeping like snail
	Unwillingly to school And then the lover
	Sighing like furnace with a woeful ballad
	Made to his mistress eyebrow Then a soldier
	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard
	Jealous in honour sudden and quick in quarrel
	Seeking the bubble reputation
	Even in the cannons mouth And then the justice
	In fair round belly with good capon lined
	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut
	Full of wise saws and modern instances
	And so he plays his part The sixth age shifts
	Into the lean and slipperd pantaloon
	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side
	His youthful hose well saved a world too wide
	For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice
	Turning again toward childish treble pipes
	And whistles in his sound Last scene of all
	That ends this strange eventful history
	Is second childishness and mere oblivion
	Sans teeth sans eyes sans taste sans everything

	Reenter ORLANDO with ADAM

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome Set down your venerable burthen
	And let him feed

ORLANDO	I thank you most for him

ADAM	So had you need
	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome fall to I will not trouble you
	As yet to question you about your fortunes
	Give us some music and good cousin sing

	SONG
AMIENS	Blow blow thou winter wind
	Thou art not so unkind
	As mans ingratitude
	Thy tooth is not so keen
	Because thou art not seen
	Although thy breath be rude
	Heighho sing heighho unto the green holly
	Most friendship is feigning most loving mere folly
	Then heighho the holly
	This life is most jolly
	Freeze freeze thou bitter sky
	That dost not bite so nigh
	As benefits forgot
	Though thou the waters warp
	Thy sting is not so sharp
	As friend rememberd not
	Heighho sing c

DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowlands son
	As you have whisperd faithfully you were
	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
	Most truly limnd and living in your face
	Be truly welcome hither I am the duke
	That loved your father the residue of your fortune
	Go to my cave and tell me Good old man
	Thou art right welcome as thy master is
	Support him by the arm Give me your hand
	And let me all your fortunes understand

SCENE I	A room in the palace


	Enter DUKE FREDERICK Lords and OLIVER

DUKE FREDERICK	Not see him since? Sir sir that cannot be
	But were I not the better part made mercy
	I should not seek an absent argument
	Of my revenge thou present But look to it

	Of what we think against thee

OLIVER	O that your highness knew my heart in this

DUKE FREDERICK	More villain thou Well push him out of doors
	And let my officers of such a nature
	Make an extent upon his house and lands

ACT III



SCENE II	The forest


	Enter ORLANDO with a paper

ORLANDO	Hang there my verse in witness of my love
	And thou thricecrowned queen of night survey
	With thy chaste eye from thy pale sphere above
	Thy huntress name that my full life doth sway
	O Rosalind these trees shall be my books
	And in their barks my thoughts Ill character
	That every eye which in this forest looks
	Shall see thy virtue witnessd every where
	Run run Orlando carve on every tree
	The fair the chaste and unexpressive she

	Exit

	Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CORIN	And how like you this shepherds life Master Touchstone?

TOUCHSTONE	Truly shepherd in respect of itself it is a good
	life but in respect that it is a shepherds life
	it is naught In respect that it is solitary I
	like it very well but in respect that it is
	private it is a very vile life Now in respect it
	is in the fields it pleaseth me well but in
	respect it is not in the court it is tedious As
	is it a spare life look you it fits my humour well
	but as there is no more plenty in it it goes much
	against my stomach Hast any philosophy in thee shepherd?

CORIN	No more but that I know the more one sickens the
	worse at ease he is and that he that wants money
	means and content is without three good friends
	that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
	burn that good pasture makes fat sheep and that a
	great cause of the night is lack of the sun that
	he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
	complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred

TOUCHSTONE	Such a one is a natural philosopher Wast ever in
	court shepherd?

CORIN	No truly

TOUCHSTONE	Then thou art damned

CORIN	Nay I hope

TOUCHSTONE	Truly thou art damned like an illroasted egg all
	on one side

CORIN	For not being at court? Your reason

TOUCHSTONE	Why if thou never wast at court thou never sawest
	good manners if thou never sawest good manners
	then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is
	sin and sin is damnation Thou art in a parlous
	state shepherd

CORIN	Not a whit Touchstone those that are good manners
	at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
	behavior of the country is most mockable at the
	court You told me you salute not at the court but
	you kiss your hands that courtesy would be
	uncleanly if courtiers were shepherds

TOUCHSTONE	Instance briefly come instance

CORIN	Why we are still handling our ewes and their
	fells you know are greasy

TOUCHSTONE	Why do not your courtiers hands sweat? and is not
	the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
	a man? Shallow shallow A better instance I say come

CORIN	Besides our hands are hard

TOUCHSTONE	Your lips will feel them the sooner Shallow again
	A more sounder instance come

CORIN	And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
	our sheep and would you have us kiss tar? The
	courtiers hands are perfumed with civet

TOUCHSTONE	Most shallow man thou wormsmeat in respect of a
	good piece of flesh indeed Learn of the wise and
	perpend civet is of a baser birth than tar the
	very uncleanly flux of a cat Mend the instance shepherd

CORIN	You have too courtly a wit for me Ill rest

TOUCHSTONE	Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee shallow man
	God make incision in thee thou art raw

CORIN	Sir I am a true labourer I earn that I eat get
	that I wear owe no man hate envy no mans
	happiness glad of other mens good content with my
	harm and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
	graze and my lambs suck

TOUCHSTONE	That is another simple sin in you to bring the ewes
	and the rams together and to offer to get your
	living by the copulation of cattle to be bawd to a
	bellwether and to betray a shelamb of a
	twelvemonth to a crookedpated old cuckoldly ram
	out of all reasonable match If thou beest not
	damned for this the devil himself will have no
	shepherds I cannot see else how thou shouldst
	scape

CORIN	Here comes young Master Ganymede my new mistresss brother

	Enter ROSALIND with a paper reading

ROSALIND	     From the east to western Ind
	No jewel is like Rosalind
	Her worth being mounted on the wind
	Through all the world bears Rosalind
	All the pictures fairest lined
	Are but black to Rosalind
	Let no fair be kept in mind
	But the fair of Rosalind

TOUCHSTONE	Ill rhyme you so eight years together dinners and
	suppers and sleepinghours excepted it is the
	right butterwomens rank to market

ROSALIND	Out fool

TOUCHSTONE	For a taste
	If a hart do lack a hind
	Let him seek out Rosalind
	If the cat will after kind
	So be sure will Rosalind
	Winter garments must be lined
	So must slender Rosalind
	They that reap must sheaf and bind
	Then to cart with Rosalind
	Sweetest nut hath sourest rind
	Such a nut is Rosalind
	He that sweetest rose will find
	Must find loves prick and Rosalind
	This is the very false gallop of verses why do you
	infect yourself with them?

ROSALIND	Peace you dull fool I found them on a tree

TOUCHSTONE	Truly the tree yields bad fruit

ROSALIND	Ill graff it with you and then I shall graff it
	with a medlar then it will be the earliest fruit
	i the country for youll be rotten ere you be half
	ripe and thats the right virtue of the medlar

TOUCHSTONE	You have said but whether wisely or no let the
	forest judge

	Enter CELIA with a writing

ROSALIND	Peace Here comes my sister reading stand aside

CELIA	Reads

	Why should this a desert be?
	For it is unpeopled? No
	Tongues Ill hang on every tree
	That shall civil sayings show
	Some how brief the life of man
	Runs his erring pilgrimage
	That the stretching of a span
	Buckles in his sum of age
	Some of violated vows
	Twixt the souls of friend and friend
	But upon the fairest boughs
	Or at every sentence end
	Will I Rosalinda write
	Teaching all that read to know
	The quintessence of every sprite
	Heaven would in little show
	Therefore Heaven Nature charged
	That one body should be filld
	With all graces wideenlarged
	Nature presently distilld
	Helens cheek but not her heart
	Cleopatras majesty
	Atalantas better part
	Sad Lucretias modesty
	Thus Rosalind of many parts
	By heavenly synod was devised
	Of many faces eyes and hearts
	To have the touches dearest prized
	Heaven would that she these gifts should have
	And I to live and die her slave

ROSALIND	O most gentle pulpiter what tedious homily of love
	have you wearied your parishioners withal and never
	cried Have patience good people

CELIA	How now back friends Shepherd go off a little
	Go with him sirrah

TOUCHSTONE	Come shepherd let us make an honourable retreat
	though not with bag and baggage yet with scrip and scrippage

	Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CELIA	Didst thou hear these verses?

ROSALIND	O yes I heard them all and more too for some of
	them had in them more feet than the verses would bear

CELIA	Thats no matter the feet might bear the verses

ROSALIND	Ay but the feet were lame and could not bear
	themselves without the verse and therefore stood
	lamely in the verse

CELIA	But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
	should be hanged and carved upon these trees?

ROSALIND	I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
	before you came for look here what I found on a
	palmtree I was never so berhymed since
	Pythagoras time that I was an Irish rat which I
	can hardly remember

CELIA	Trow you who hath done this?

ROSALIND	Is it a man?

CELIA	And a chain that you once wore about his neck
	Change you colour?

ROSALIND	I prithee who?

CELIA	O Lord Lord it is a hard matter for friends to
	meet but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
	and so encounter

ROSALIND	Nay but who is it?

CELIA	Is it possible?

ROSALIND	Nay I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence
	tell me who it is

CELIA	O wonderful wonderful and most wonderful
	wonderful and yet again wonderful and after that
	out of all hooping

ROSALIND	Good my complexion dost thou think though I am
	caparisoned like a man I have a doublet and hose in
	my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
	Southsea of discovery I prithee tell me who is it
	quickly and speak apace I would thou couldst
	stammer that thou mightst pour this concealed man
	out of thy mouth as wine comes out of a narrow
	mouthed bottle either too much at once or none at
	all I prithee take the cork out of thy mouth that
	may drink thy tidings

CELIA	So you may put a man in your belly
