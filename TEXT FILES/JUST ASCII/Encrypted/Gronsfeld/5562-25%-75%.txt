Andorra Economy

Overview
    The mainstay of Andorras economy is tourism An estimated  million
    tourists visit annually attracted by Andorras dutyfree status and by its
    summer and winter resorts Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
    of arable land and most food has to be imported The principal livestock
    activity is sheep raising Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes
    cigars and furniture The rapid pace of European economic integration is a
    potential threat to Andorras advantages from its dutyfree status

Angola Economy

Overview
    Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for  of the
    population but accounts for less than  of GDP Oil production is vital
    to the economy contributing about  to GDP In recent years a bitter
    internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy and food has to be
    imported For the long run Angola has the advantage of rich natural
    resources in addition to oil notably gold diamonds and arable land To
    realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace
    but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
    imbalances throughout the economy
