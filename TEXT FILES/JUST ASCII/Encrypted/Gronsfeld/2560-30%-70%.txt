Kazakhstan Economy

Overview
    The secondlargest in area of the  former Soviet republics Kazakhstan has
    vast oil coal and agricultural resources Kazakhstan is highly dependent
    on trade with Russia exchanging its natural resources for finished consumer
    and industrial goods Kazakhstan now finds itself with serious pollution
    problems backward technology and little experience in foreign markets The
    government in  pushed privatization of the economy at a faster pace than
    Russias program The ongoing transitional period  marked by sharp
    inflation in wages and prices lower output lost jobs and disruption of
    timehonored channels of supply  has brought considerable social unrest
    Kazakhstan lacks the funds technology and managerial skills for a quick
    recovery of output US firms have been enlisted to increase oil output but
    face formidable obstacles for example oil can now reach Western markets
    only through pipelines that run across independent and sometimes
    unfriendly former Soviet republics Finally the end of monolithic
    Communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open The  million
    Russians in the republic formerly the favored class now face the hostility
    of a society dominated by Muslims Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the
    formidable obstacles to the creation of a productive technologically
    advancing society
