GNPGDP methodology In the Economy section GNPGDP dollar estimates for
the OECD countries the former Soviet republics and the East European
countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP calculations rather
than from conversions at official currency exchange rates The PPP method
normally involves the use of international dollar price weights which are
applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy
In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries the
statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying identifying and allowing
for the quality of goods and services The division of a PPP GNPGDP estimate
in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP
conversion rate One thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods
in the US as one thousand dollars  converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate  will buy in the other country GNPGDP estimates for the
LDCs on the other hand are based on the conversion of GNPGDP estimates in
local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates One
caution the proportion of say defense expenditures as a percent of GNPGDP
in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when
GNPGDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms as for example when an observer
estimates the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures
similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency
exchange rate procedures Finally as academic research moves forward on the
PPP method we hope to convert all GNPGDP estimates to this method in future
editions of The World Factbook

Growth rate population The annual percent change in the population
resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over deaths and the balance
of migrants entering and leaving a country The rate may be positive or
negative

the ability to read and write at a specified age Detailing the standards
that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write is
beyond the scope of this publication

Maps All maps will be available only in the printed version for the fore
seeable future

Maritime claims The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some
national claims from being fully extended

Merchant marine All ships engaged in the carriage of goods All commercial
vessels as opposed to all nonmilitary ships which excludes tugs fishing
vessels offshore oil rigs etc also a grouping of merchant ships by
nationality or register

Captive register  A register of ships maintained by a territory possession
or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent
country also referred to as an offshore register the offshore equivalent
of an internal register Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag
as the parent country or a local variant of it but will be subject to the
maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory Although the
nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in
the parent country just as in the internal register the ships may also be
owned abroad The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register except that it is not the register of an independent state

Flag of convenience register  A national register offering registration to a
merchant ship not owned in the flag state The major flags of convenience
FOC attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees low or
nonexistent taxation of profits and liberal manning requirements True FOC
registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered
actually owned in the flag state Thus while virtually any flag can be used
for ships under a given set of circumstances an FOC register is one where
the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad
It is also referred to as an open register

Flag state  The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal
jurisdiction over operation of the ship whether at home or abroad
Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned
and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be placed on the register

Internal register  A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national
register Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that
nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on
the main national register These differences usually include lower taxation
of profits manning by foreign nationals and usually ownership outside the
flag state when it functions as an FOC register The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable
examples of an internal register
Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to
flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to the Norwegian
and Danish flags

Merchant ship  A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight
commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to
commercial vessels only

Register  The record of a ships ownership and nationality as listed with
the maritime authorities of a country also the compendium of such individual
ships registrations Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality
and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered the flag
state regardless of the nationality of the ships ultimate owner

Money figures All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless
otherwise indicated

Net migration rate The balance between the number of persons entering and
leaving a country during the year per  persons based on midyear
population An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net
immigration  migrants population an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration  migrants population

Population Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on
statistics from population censuses vital registration systems or sample
surveys pertaining to the recent past and on assumptions about future trends

Total fertility rate The average number of children that would be born per
woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore
children according to a given fertility rate at each age

Years All year references are for the calendar year CY unless indicated as
fiscal year FY
