Serbia and Montenegro Economy

Overview
    The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been accompanied by bloody
    ethnic warfare the destabilization of republic boundaries and the breakup
    of important interrepublic trade flows The situation in Serbia and
    Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military
    strife This new state faces major economic problems First like the other
    former Yugoslav republics Serbia and Montenegro depended on their sister
    republics for large amounts of foodstuffs energy supplies and
    manufactures Wide varieties in climate mineral resources and levels of
    technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence as did
    the Communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
    number of giant plants The breakup of many of the trade links the sharp
    drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets and the
    destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the
    economic difficulties of the republics One singular factor in the economic
    situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a
    Communist government that is primarily interested in political and military
    mastery not economic reform A further complication is the major economic
    sanctions by the leading industrial nations
