Returned not lost  On to the sacred hill
They led him high applauded and present
Before the seat supreme from whence a voice
From midst a golden cloud thus mild was heard
Servant of God Well done well hast thou fought
The better fight who single hast maintained
Against revolted multitudes the cause
Of truth in word mightier than they in arms
And for the testimony of truth hast borne
Universal reproach far worse to bear
Than violence for this was all thy care
To stand approved in sight of God though worlds
Judged thee perverse  The easier conquest now
Remains thee aided by this host of friends
Back on thy foes more glorious to return
Than scorned thou didst depart and to subdue
By force who reason for their law refuse
Right reason for their law and for their King
Messiah who by right of merit reigns
Go Michael of celestial armies prince
And thou in military prowess next
Gabriel lead forth to battle these my sons
Invincible lead forth my armed Saints
By thousands and by millions ranged for fight
Equal in number to that Godless crew
Rebellious  Them with fire and hostile arms
Fearless assault and to the brow of Heaven
Pursuing drive them out from God and bliss
Into their place of punishment the gulf
Of Tartarus which ready opens wide
His fiery Chaos to receive their fall
So spake the Sovran Voice and clouds began
To darken all the hill and smoke to roll
In dusky wreaths reluctant flames the sign
Of wrath awaked nor with less dread the loud
Ethereal trumpet from on high gan blow
At which command the Powers militant
That stood for Heaven in mighty quadrate joined
Of union irresistible moved on
In silence their bright legions to the sound
Of instrumental harmony that breathed
Heroick ardour to adventurous deeds
Under their Godlike leaders in the cause
Of God and his Messiah  On they move
Indissolubly firm nor obvious hill
Nor straitening vale nor wood nor stream divides
Their perfect ranks for high above the ground
Their march was and the passive air upbore
Their nimble tread as when the total kind
Of birds in orderly array on wing
Came summoned over Eden to receive
Their names of thee so over many a tract
Of Heaven they marched and many a province wide
Tenfold the length of this terrene  At last
Far in the horizon to the north appeared
From skirt to skirt a fiery region stretched
In battailous aspect and nearer view
Bristled with upright beams innumerable
Of rigid spears and helmets thronged and shields
Various with boastful argument portrayed
The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
With furious expedition for they weened
That selfsame day by fight or by surprise
To win the mount of God and on his throne
To set the Envier of his state the proud
Aspirer but their thoughts proved fond and vain
In the mid way  Though strange to us it seemed
At first that Angel should with Angel war
And in fierce hosting meet who wont to meet
So oft in festivals of joy and love
Unanimous as sons of one great Sire
Hymning the Eternal Father  But the shout
Of battle now began and rushing sound
Of onset ended soon each milder thought
High in the midst exalted as a God
The Apostate in his sunbright chariot sat
Idol of majesty divine enclosed
With flaming Cherubim and golden shields
Then lighted from his gorgeous throne for now
"twixt host and host but narrow space was left
A dreadful interval and front to front
Presented stood in terrible array
Of hideous length  Before the cloudy van
On the rough edge of battle ere it joined
Satan with vast and haughty strides advanced
Came towering armed in adamant and gold
Abdiel that sight endured not where he stood
Among the mightiest bent on highest deeds
And thus his own undaunted heart explores
O Heaven that such resemblance of the Highest
Should yet remain where faith and realty
Remain not  Wherefore should not strength and might
There fail where virtue fails or weakest prove
Where boldest though to fight unconquerable?
His puissance trusting in the Almightys aid
I mean to try whose reason I have tried
Unsound and false nor is it aught but just
That he who in debate of truth hath won
Should win in arms in both disputes alike
Victor though brutish that contest and foul
When reason hath to deal with force yet so
Most reason is that reason overcome
So pondering and from his armed peers
Forth stepping opposite halfway he met
His daring foe at this prevention more
Incensed and thus securely him defied
Proud art thou met? thy hope was to have reached
The highth of thy aspiring unopposed
The throne of God unguarded and his side
Abandoned at the terrour of thy power
Or potent tongue  Foolnot to think how vain
Against the Omnipotent to rise in arms
Who out of smallest things could without end
Have raised incessant armies to defeat
Thy folly or with solitary hand
Reaching beyond all limit at one blow
Unaided could have finished thee and whelmed
Thy legions under darkness  But thou seest
All are not of thy train there be who faith
Prefer and piety to God though then
To thee not visible when I alone
Seemed in thy world erroneous to dissent
From all  My sect thou seestnow learn too late
How few sometimes may know when thousands err
Whom the grand foe with scornful eye askance
Thus answered  Ill for thee but in wished hour
Of my revenge first sought for thou returnest
From flight seditious Angel to receive
Thy merited reward the first assay
Of this right hand provoked since first that tongue
Inspired with contradiction durst oppose
A third part of the Gods in synod met
Their deities to assert who while they feel
Vigour divine within them can allow
Omnipotence to none  But well thou comest
Before thy fellows ambitious to win
From me some plume that thy success may show
Destruction to the rest  This pause between
Unanswered lest thou boast to let thee know
At first I thought that Liberty and Heaven
To heavenly souls had been all one but now
I see that most through sloth had rather serve
Ministring Spirits trained up in feast and song
Such hast thou armed the minstrelsy of Heaven
Servility with freedom to contend
As both their deeds compared this day shall prove
To whom in brief thus Abdiel stern replied
Apostate still thou errest nor end wilt find
Of erring from the path of truth remote
Unjustly thou depravest it with the name
Of servitude to serve whom God ordains
Or Nature  God and Nature bid the same
When he who rules is worthiest and excels
Them whom he governs  This is servitude
To serve the unwise or him who hath rebelled
Against his worthier as thine now serve thee
Thyself not free but to thyself enthralled
Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid
Reign thou in Hell thy kingdom let me serve
In Heaven God ever blest and his divine
Behests obey worthiest to be obeyed
Yet chains in Hell not realms expect  Mean while
From me returned as erst thou saidst from flight
This greeting on thy impious crest receive
So saying a noble stroke he lifted high
Which hung not but so swift with tempest fell
On the proud crest of Satan that no sight
Nor motion of swift thought less could his shield
Such ruin intercept  Ten paces huge
He back recoiled the tenth on bended knee
His massy spear upstaid as if on earth
Winds under ground or waters forcing way
Sidelong had pushed a mountain from his seat
Half sunk with all his pines  Amazement seised
The rebel Thrones but greater rage to see
Thus foiled their mightiest ours joy filled and shout
Presage of victory and fierce desire
Of battle  Whereat Michael bid sound
The ArchAngel trumpet through the vast of Heaven
It sounded and the faithful armies rung
Hosanna to the Highest  Nor stood at gaze
The adverse legions nor less hideous joined
The horrid shock  Now storming fury rose
And clamour such as heard in Heaven till now
Was never arms on armour clashing brayed
Horrible discord and the madding wheels
Of brazen chariots raged dire was the noise
Of conflict over head the dismal hiss
Of fiery darts in flaming vollies flew
And flying vaulted either host with fire
So under fiery cope together rushed
Both battles main with ruinous assault
And inextinguishable rage  All Heaven
Resounded and had Earth been then all Earth
Had to her center shook  What wonder? when
Millions of fierce encountering Angels fought
On either side the least of whom could wield
These elements and arm him with the force
Of all their regions  How much more of power
Army against army numberless to raise
Dreadful combustion warring and disturb
Though not destroy their happy native seat
Had not the Eternal King Omnipotent
From his strong hold of Heaven high overruled
And limited their might though numbered such
As each divided legion might have seemed
A numerous host in strength each armed hand
A legion led in fight yet leader seemed
Each warriour single as in chief expert
When to advance or stand or turn the sway
Of battle open when and when to close
The ridges of grim war  No thought of flight
None of retreat no unbecoming deed
That argued fear each on himself relied
As only in his arm the moment lay
Of victory  Deeds of eternal fame
Were done but infinite for wide was spread
That war and various sometimes on firm ground
A standing fight then soaring on main wing
Tormented all the air all air seemed then
Conflicting fire  Long time in even scale
The battle hung till Satan who that day
Prodigious power had shown and met in arms
No equal ranging through the dire attack
Of fighting Seraphim confused at length
Saw where the sword of Michael smote and felled
Squadrons at once with huge twohanded sway
Brandished aloft the horrid edge came down
Widewasting such destruction to withstand
He hasted and opposed the rocky orb
Of tenfold adamant his ample shield
A vast circumference  At his approach
The great ArchAngel from his warlike toil
Surceased and glad as hoping here to end
Intestine war in Heaven the archfoe subdued
Or captive dragged in chains with hostile frown
And visage all inflamed first thus began
Author of evil unknown till thy revolt
Unnamed in Heaven now plenteous as thou seest
These acts of hateful strife hateful to all
Though heaviest by just measure on thyself
And thy  adherents  How hast thou disturbed
Heavens blessed peace and into nature brought
Misery uncreated till the crime
Of thy rebellion how hast thou instilled
Thy malice into thousands once upright
And faithful now proved false  But think not here
To trouble holy rest Heaven casts thee out
From all her confines  Heaven the seat of bliss
Brooks not the works of violence and war
Hence then and evil go with thee along
Thy offspring to the place of evil Hell
Thou and thy wicked crew there mingle broils
Ere this avenging sword begin thy doom
Or some more sudden vengeance winged from God
Precipitate thee with augmented pain
So spake the Prince of Angels to whom thus
The Adversary  Nor think thou with wind
Of aery threats to awe whom yet with deeds
Thou canst not  Hast thou turned the least of these
To flight or if to fall but that they rise
Unvanquished easier to transact with me
That thou shouldst hope imperious and with threats
To chase me hence? err not that so shall end
The strife which thou callest evil but we style
The strife of glory which we mean to win
Or turn this Heaven itself into the Hell
Thou fablest here however to dwell free
If not to reign  Mean while thy utmost force
And join him named Almighty to thy aid
I fly not but have sought thee far and nigh
They ended parle and both addressed for fight
Unspeakable for who though with the tongue
Of Angels can relate or to what things
Liken on earth conspicuous that may lift
Human imagination to such highth
Of Godlike power? for likest Gods they seemed
Stood they or moved in stature motion arms
Fit to decide the empire of great Heaven
Now waved their fiery swords and in the air
Made horrid circles two broad suns their shields
Blazed opposite while Expectation stood
In horrour  From each hand with speed retired
Where erst was thickest fight the angelick throng
And left large field unsafe within the wind
Of such commotion such as to set forth
Great things by small if natures concord broke
Among the constellations war were sprung
Two planets rushing from aspect malign
