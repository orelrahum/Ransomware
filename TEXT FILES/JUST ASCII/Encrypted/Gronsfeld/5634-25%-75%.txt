Suriname Economy

     of export earnings and  of tax revenues The economy has been in
    trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in  A drop in world
    bauxite prices which started in the late s and continued until late 
    was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in the interior that
    crippled the important bauxite sector Although the insurgency has since
    ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered a military coup in December 
    reflected continued political instability and deterred investment and
    economic reform High inflation high unemployment widespread black market
    activity and hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy

    deposits were depleted in  and health concerns cut world demand for
    asbestos Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of

Sweden Economy

Overview
    Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I through
    World War II Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
    mixed system of hightech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits It has
    essentially full employment a modern distribution system excellent
    internal and external communications and a skilled labor force Timber
    hydropower and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is
    heavily oriented toward foreign trade Privately owned firms account for
    about  of industrial output of which the engineering sector accounts for
     of output and exports In the last few years however this
    extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by inflation growing
    absenteeism and a gradual loss of competitiveness in international markets
    The new centerright government facing a sagging economic situation which
    is unlikely to improve until  is pushing full steam ahead with economic
    reform proposals to end Swedens recession and to prepare for possible EC
    membership in  The freemarketoriented reforms are designed to spur
    growth maintain price stability lower unemploymeVY KTEJBI D RSYN
