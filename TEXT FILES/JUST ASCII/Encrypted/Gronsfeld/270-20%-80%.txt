	your remedy

ROSALIND	There is none of my uncles marks upon you he
	taught me how to know a man in love in which cage
	of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner

ORLANDO	What were his marks?

ROSALIND	A lean cheek which you have not a blue eye and
	sunken which you have not an unquestionable
	spirit which you have not a beard neglected
	which you have not but I pardon you for that for
	simply your having in beard is a younger brothers
	revenue then your hose should be ungartered your
	bonnet unbanded your sleeve unbuttoned your shoe
	untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
	careless desolation but you are no such man you
	are rather pointdevice in your accoutrements as
	loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other

ORLANDO	Fair youth I would I could make thee believe I love

ROSALIND	Me believe it you may as soon make her that you
	love believe it which I warrant she is apter to
	do than to confess she does that is one of the
	points in the which women still give the lie to
	their consciences But in good sooth are you he
	that hangs the verses on the trees wherein Rosalind
	is so admired?

ORLANDO	I swear to thee youth by the white hand of
	Rosalind I am that he that unfortunate he

ROSALIND	But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?

ORLANDO	Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much

ROSALIND	Love is merely a madness and I tell you deserves
	as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do and
	the reason why they are not so punished and cured
	is that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
	are in love too Yet I profess curing it by counsel

ORLANDO	Did you ever cure any so?

ROSALIND	Yes one and in this manner He was to imagine me
	his love his mistress and I set him every day to
	woo me at which time would I being but a moonish
	youth grieve be effeminate changeable longing
	and liking proud fantastical apish shallow
	inconstant full of tears full of smiles for every
	passion something and for no passion truly any
	thing as boys and women are for the most part
	cattle of this colour would now like him now loathe
	him then entertain him then forswear him now weep
	for him then spit at him that I drave my suitor
	from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
	madness which was to forswear the full stream of
	the world and to live in a nook merely monastic
	And thus I cured him and this way will I take upon
	me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheeps
	heart that there shall not be one spot of love int

ORLANDO	I would not be cured youth

ROSALIND	I would cure you if you would but call me Rosalind
	and come every day to my cote and woo me

ORLANDO	Now by the faith of my love I will tell me
	where it is

ROSALIND	Go with me to it and Ill show it you and by the way
	you shall tell me where in the forest you live
	Will you go?

ORLANDO	With all my heart good youth

ROSALIND	Nay you must call me Rosalind Come sister will you go?

	Exeunt




	AS YOU LIKE IT


ACT III



SCENE III	The forest


	Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY JAQUES behind

TOUCHSTONE	Come apace good Audrey I will fetch up your
	goats Audrey And how Audrey? am I the man yet?
	doth my simple feature content you?

AUDREY	Your features Lord warrant us what features

TOUCHSTONE	I am here with thee and thy goats as the most
	capricious poet honest Ovid was among the Goths

JAQUES	Aside  O knowledge illinhabited worse than Jove
	in a thatched house

TOUCHSTONE	When a mans verses cannot be understood nor a
	mans good wit seconded with the forward child
	Understanding it strikes a man more dead than a
	great reckoning in a little room Truly I would
	the gods had made thee poetical

AUDREY	I do not know what poetical is is it honest in
	deed and word? is it a true thing?

TOUCHSTONE	No truly for the truest poetry is the most
	feigning and lovers are given to poetry and what
	they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign

AUDREY	Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?

TOUCHSTONE	I do truly for thou swearest to me thou art
	honest now if thou wert a poet I might have some
	hope thou didst feign

AUDREY	Would you not have me honest?

TOUCHSTONE	No truly unless thou wert hardfavoured for
	honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar

JAQUES	Aside  A material fool

AUDREY	 Well I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods
	make me honest

TOUCHSTONE	Truly and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
	were to put good meat into an unclean dish

AUDREY	I am not a slut though I thank the gods I am foul

TOUCHSTONE	Well praised be the gods for thy foulness
	sluttishness may come hereafter But be it as it may
	be I will marry thee and to that end I have been
	with Sir Oliver Martext the vicar of the next
	village who hath promised to meet me in this place
	of the forest and to couple us

JAQUES	Aside  I would fain see this meeting

AUDREY	Well the gods give us joy

TOUCHSTONE	Amen A man may if he were of a fearful heart
	stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple
	but the wood no assembly but hornbeasts But what
	though? Courage As horns are odious they are
	necessary It is said many a man knows no end of
	his goods right many a man has good horns and
	knows no end of them Well that is the dowry of
	his wife tis none of his own getting Horns?
	Even so Poor men alone? No no the noblest deer
	hath them as huge as the rascal Is the single man
	therefore blessed? No as a walled town is more
	worthier than a village so is the forehead of a
	married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
	bachelor and by how much defence is better than no
	skill by so much is a horn more precious than to
	want Here comes Sir Oliver

	Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT

	Sir Oliver Martext you are well met will you
	dispatch us here under this tree or shall we go
	with you to your chapel?

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Is there none here to give the woman?

TOUCHSTONE	I will not take her on gift of any man

SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Truly she must be given or the marriage is not lawful

JAQUES	Advancing

	Proceed proceed	Ill give her

TOUCHSTONE	Good even good Master Whatyecallt how do you
	sir? You are very well met God ild you for your
	last KTURAWG M DR ZLAG LTCD CW WHJ CVD MAMP A
