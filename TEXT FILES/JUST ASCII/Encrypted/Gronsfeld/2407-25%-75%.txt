Note
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June  ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip the Sinai and the Golan
    Heights As stated in the  Camp David accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bushs post  Gulf crisis peace initiative the final status of
    the West Bank and the Gaza Strip their relationship with their neighbors
    and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries Pending the completion of this process
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined In the US view the term West Bank describes all
    of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before
    the  ArabIsraeli war With respect to negotiations envisaged in the
    framework agreement however it is US policy that a distinction must be
    made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys
    special status and circumstances Therefore a negotiated solution for the
    final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the
    rest of the West Bank
    The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military authorities and
    Israeli civil administration it is US policy that the final status of the
    Gaza Strip will be determined by negotiations among the concerned parties
    these negotiations will determine how this area is to be governed

Georgia Economy

Overview
    Among the former Soviet republics Georgia is noted for its Black Sea
    tourist industry its large output of citrus fruits and tea and the amazing
    diversity of an industrial sector that accounted however for less than 
    of the USSRs output Another salient characteristic of the economy has been
    a flourishing private sector compared with the other republics Almost 
    of the labor force is employed in agriculture and  in industry Mineral
    resources consist of manganese and copper and to a lesser extent
    molybdenum arsenic tungsten and mercury Except for very small quantities
    of domestic oil gas and coal fuel must be imported from neighboring
    republics Oil and its products are delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to
    the port of Batumi for export and local refining Gas is supplied in
    pipelines from Krasnodar and Stavropol Georgia is nearly selfsufficient
    in electric power thanks to abundant hydropower stations as well as some
    thermal power stations The dismantling of central economic controls is
    being delayed by political factionalism marked by armed struggles between
    the elected government and the opposition and industrial output seems to
    have fallen more steeply in Georgia in  than in any other of the former
    Soviet republics To prevent further economic decline Georgia must
    establish domestic peace and must maintain economic ties to the other former
    Soviet republics while developing new links to the West
