Iceland Economy

Overview
    Icelands prosperous Scandinaviantype economy is basically capitalistic
    but with extensive welfare measures low unemployment and comparatively
    even distribution of income The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry which provides nearly  of export earnings In the absence of
    other natural resources Icelands economy is vulnerable to changing world
    fish prices The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
    in  and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
    plant The conservative governments economic priorities include reducing
    the budget and current account deficits containing inflation revising
    agricultural and fishing policies diversifying the economy and tying the
    krona to the ECs European currency unit in  The fishing industries 
    notably the shrimp industry  are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
    mergers Inflation has continued to drop sharply from  in  to about
     in  and possibly  in  while unemployment is expected to
    increase to  GDP is expected to contract by nearly  in

India Economy

Overview
    Indias economy is a mixture of traditional village farming and handicrafts
    modern agriculture old and new branches of industry and a multitude of
    support services It presents both the entrepreneurial skills and drives of
    the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the
    socialist mold Growth of  annually in the s has softened the impact
    of population growth on unemployment social tranquility and the
    environment Agricultural output has continued to expand reflecting the
    greater use of modern farming techniques and improved seed that have helped
    to make India selfsufficient in food grains and a net agricultural
    exporter However tens of millions of villagers particularly in the south
    have not benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty and
    great numbers of urban residents lack the basic essentials of life Industry
    has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls The growth rate of
    the service sector has also been strong India however has been challenged
    more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves higher inflation and
    a large debt service burden
