	When birds do sing hey ding a ding ding
	Sweet lovers love the spring

	Between the acres of the rye
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	These pretty country folks would lie
	In spring time c

	This carol they began that hour
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	How that a life was but a flower
	In spring time c

	And therefore take the present time
	With a hey and a ho and a hey nonino
	For love is crowned with the prime
	In spring time c

TOUCHSTONE	Truly young gentlemen though there was no great
	matter in the ditty yet the note was very
	untuneable

First Page	You are deceived sir we kept time we lost not our time

	your voices Come Audrey
