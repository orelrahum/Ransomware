    has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales In
     teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this
    position The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector which
    generates about  of GDP and provides employment for  of the work
    force Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces
