scholarlycontrolled journals that are electronically produced and
disseminated  Although such journals are still emerging as a
communication format their number has grown from approximately twelve
to thirtysix during the past year July  to June   Most of
these electronic scholarly journals are devoted to topics in the
humanities  As with network conferences scholarly enthusiasm for these
electronic journals stems from the mediums unique ability to advance
scholarship in a way that no other medium can do by supporting global
feedback and interchange practically in real time early in the research
process  Beyond scholarly journals MICHELSON remarked the delivery of
commercial fulltext products such as articles in professional journals
newsletters magazines wire services and reference sources  These are
being delivered via online local library catalogues especially through
CDROMs  Furthermore according to MICHELSON there is general optimism
that the copyright and fees issues impeding the delivery of full text on
existing research and education networks soon will be resolved

The final process of scholarly communication is curriculum development
and instruction and this involves the use of computer information
technologies in two areas  The first is the development of
computeroriented instructional tools which includes simulations
multimedia applications and computer tools that are used to assist in
the analysis of sources in the classroom etc  The Perseus Project a
database that provides a multimedia curriculum on classical Greek
civilization is a good example of the way in which entire curricula are
being recast using information technologies  It is anticipated that the
current difficulty in exchanging electronically computerbased
instructional software which in turn makes it difficult for one scholar
to build upon the work of others will be resolved before too long
Standalone curricular applications that involve electronic text will be
sharable through networks reinforcing their significance as intellectual
products as well as instructional tools

The second aspect of electronic learning involves the use of research and
education networks for distance education programs  Such programs
interactively link teachers with students in geographically scattered
locations and rely on the availability of electronic instructional
resources  Distance education programs are gaining wide appeal among
state departments of education because of their demonstrated capacity to
bring advanced specialized course work and an array of experts to many
classrooms  A recent report found that at least  states operated at
least one statewide network for education in  with networks under
development in many of the remaining states

MICHELSON summarized this section by noting two striking changes taking
place in scholarly communication among humanities scholars  First is the
extent to which electronic text in particular and electronic resources
in general are being infused into each of the five processes described
above  As mentioned earlier there is a certain synergy at work here
The use of electronic resources for one process tends to stimulate its
use for other processes because the chief course of movement is toward a
comprehensive online working context for humanities scholars that
includes online availability of key bibliographies scholarly feedback
sources analytical tools and publications  MICHELSON noted further
that the movement toward a comprehensive online working context for
humanities scholars is not new  In fact it has been underway for more
than forty years in the humanities since Father Roberto Busa began
developing an electronic concordance of the works of Saint Thomas Aquinas
in   What we are witnessing today MICHELSON contended is not the
beginning of this online transition but for at least some humanities
scholars the turning point in the transition from a print to an
electronic working context  Coinciding with the online transition the
second striking change is the extent to which research and education
networks are becoming the new medium of scholarly communication  The
existing Internet and the pending National Education and Research Network
NREN represent the new meeting ground where scholars are going for
bibliographic information scholarly dialogue and feedback the most
current publications in their field and highlevel educational
offerings  Traditional scholarly practices are undergoing tremendous
transformations as a result of the emergence and growing prominence of
what is called networkmediated scholarship

MICHELSON next turned to the second element of the framework she proposed
at the outset of her talk for evaluating the prospects for electronic
text namely the key information technology trends affecting the conduct
of scholarly communication over the next decade   enduser computing
and  connectivity

Enduser computing means that the person touching the keyboard or
performing computations is the same as the person who initiates or
consumes the computation  The emergence of personal computers along
with a host of other forces such as ubiquitous computing advances in
interface design and the online transition is prompting the consumers
of computation to do their own computing and is thus rendering obsolete
the traditional distinction between end users and ultimate users

The trend toward enduser computing is significant to consideration of
the prospects for electronic texts because it means that researchers are
becoming more adept at doing their own computations and thus more
competent in the use of electronic media  By avoiding programmer
intermediaries computation is becoming central to the researchers
thought process  This direct involvement in computing is changing the
researchers perspective on the nature of research itself that is the
kinds of questions that can be posed the analytical methodologies that
can be used the types and amount of sources that are appropriate for
analyses and the form in which findings are presented  The trend toward
enduser computing means that increasingly electronic media and
computation are being infused into all processes of humanities
scholarship inspiring remarkable transformations in scholarly
communication

The trend toward greater connectivity suggests that researchers are using
computation increasingly in network environments  Connectivity is
important to scholarship because it erases the distance that separates
students from teachers and scholars from their colleagues while allowing
users to access remote databases share information in many different
media connect to their working context wherever they are and
collaborate in all phases of research

The combination of the trend toward enduser computing and the trend
toward connectivity suggests that the scholarly use of electronic
resources already evident among some researchers will soon become an
established feature of scholarship  The effects of these trends along
with ongoing changes in scholarly practices point to a future in which
humanities researchers will use computation and electronic communication
to help them formulate ideas access sources perform research
collaborate with colleagues seek peer review publish and disseminate
results and engage in many other professional and educational activities

In summary MICHELSON emphasized four points   A portion of humanities
scholars already consider electronic texts the preferred format for
analysis and dissemination   Scholars are using these electronic
texts in conjunction with other electronic resources in all the
processes of scholarly communication   The humanities scholars
working context is in the process of changing from print technology to
electronic technology in many ways mirroring transformations that have
occurred or are occurring within the scientific community   These
changes are occurring in conjunction with the development of a new
communication medium  research and education networks that are
characterized by their capacity to advance scholarship in a wholly unique
way

MICHELSON also reiterated her three principal arguments  l Electronic
texts are best understood in terms of the relationship to other
electronic resources and the growing prominence of networkmediated
scholarship   The prospects for electronic texts lie in their capacity
to be integrated into the online network of electronic resources that
comprise the new working context for scholars   Retrospective conversion
of portions of the scholarly record should be a key strategy as information
providers respond to changes in scholarly communication practices

                                 


VECCIA  AMs evaluation project and public users of electronic resources
 AM and its design  Site selection and evaluating the Macintosh
implementation of AM  Characteristics of the six public libraries
selected  Characteristics of AMs users in these libraries  Principal
ways AM is being used 


Susan VECCIA team leader and Joanne FREEMAN associate coordinator
American Memory Library of Congress gave a joint presentation  First
by way of introduction VECCIA explained her and FREEMANs roles in
American Memory AM  Serving principally as an observer VECCIA has
assisted with the evaluation project of AM placing AM collections in a
variety of different sites around the country and helping to organize and
implement that project  FREEMAN has been an associate coordinator of AM
and has been involved principally with the interpretative materials
preparing some of the electronic exhibits and printed historical
information that accompanies AM and that is requested by users  VECCIA
and FREEMAN shared anecdotal observations concerning AM with public users
of electronic resources  Notwithstanding a fairly structured evaluation
in progress both VECCIA and FREEMAN chose not to report on specifics in
terms of numbers etc because they felt it was too early in the
evaluation project to do so

AM is an electronic archive of primary source materials from the Library
of Congress selected collections representing a variety of formats
photographs graphic arts recorded sound motion pictures broadsides
and soon pamphlets and books  In terms of the design of this system
the interpretative exhibits have been kept separate from the primary
resources with good reason  Accompanying this collection are printed
documentation and user guides as well as guides that FREEMAN prepared for
teachers so that they may begin using the content of the system at once

VECCIA described the evaluation project before talking about the public
users of AM limiting her remarks to public libraries because FREEMAN
would talk more specifically about schools from kindergarten to twelfth
grade K   Having started in spring  the evaluation currently
involves testing of the Macintosh implementation of AM  Since the
primary goal of this evaluation is to determine the most appropriate
audience or audiences for AM very different sites were selected  This
makes evaluation difficult because of the varying degrees of technology
literacy among the sites  AM is situated in fortyfour locations of
which six are public libraries and sixteen are schools  Represented
among the schools are elementary junior high and high schools
District offices also are involved in the evaluation which will
conclude in summer 

VECCIA focused the remainder of her talk on the six public libraries one
of which doubles as a state library  They represent a range of
geographic areas and a range of demographic characteristics  For
example three are located in urban settings two in rural settings and
one in a suburban setting  A range of technical expertise is to be found
among these facilities as well  For example one is an "Apple library of
the future" while two others are rural oneroom librariesin one AM
sits at the front desk next to a tractor manual

All public libraries have been extremely enthusiastic supportive and
appreciative of the work that AM has been doing  VECCIA characterized
various users  Most users in public libraries describe themselves as
general readers of the students who use AM in the public libraries
those in fourth grade and above seem most interested  Public libraries
in rural sites tend to attract retired people who have been highly
receptive to AM  Users tend to fall into two additional categories
people interested in the content and historical connotations of these
primary resources and those fascinated by the technology  The format
receiving the most comments has been motion pictures  The adult users in
public libraries are more comfortable with IBM computers whereas young
people seem comfortable with either IBM or Macintosh although most of
them seem to come from a Macintosh background  This same tendency is
found in the schools

What kinds of things do users do with AM?  In a public library there are
two main goals or ways that AM is being used  as an individual learning
tool and as a leisure activity  Adult learning was one area that VECCIA
would highlight as a possible application for a tool such as AM  She
described a patron of a rural public library who comes in every day on
his lunch hour and literally reads AM methodically going through the
collection image by image  At the end of his hour he makes an electronic
bookmark puts it in his pocket and returns to work  The next day he
comes in and resumes where he left off  Interestingly this man had
never been in the library before he used AM  In another small rural
library the coordinator reports that AM is a popular activity for some
of the older retired people in the community who ordinarily would not
use "those things"computers  Another example of adult learning in
public libraries is book groups one of which in particular is using AM
as part of its reading on industrialization integration and urbanization
in the early s

One library reports that a family is using AM to help educate their
children  In another instance individuals from a local museum came in
to use AM to prepare an exhibit on toys of the past  These two examples
emphasize the mission of the public library as a cultural institution
reaching out to people who do not have the same resources available to
those who live in a metropolitan area or have access to a major library
One rural library reports that junior high school students in large
numbers came in one afternoon to use AM for entertainment  A number of
public libraries reported great interest among postcard collectors in the
Detroit collection which was essentially a collection of images used on
postcards around the turn of the century  Train buffs are similarly
interested because that was a time of great interest in railroading
People it was found relate to things that they know of firsthand  For
example in both rural public libraries where AM was made available
observers reported that the older people with personal remembrances of
the turn of the century were gravitating to the Detroit collection
These examples served to underscore MICHELSONs observation re the
integration of electronic tools and ideasthat people learn best when
the material relates to something they know

VECCIA made the final point that in many cases AM serves as a
publicrelations tool for the public libraries that are testing it  In
one case AM is being used as a vehicle to secure additional funding for
the library  In another case AM has served as an inspiration to the
staff of a major local public library in the South to think about ways to
make its own collection of photographs more accessible to the public

                                  


FREEMAN  AM and archival electronic resources in a school environment 
Questions concerning context  Questions concerning the electronic format
itself  Computer anxiety  Access and availability of the system 
Hardware  Strengths gained through the use of archival resources in
schools 


Reiterating an observation made by VECCIA that AM is an archival
resource made up of primary materials with very little interpretation
FREEMAN stated that the project has attempted to bridge the gap between
these bare primary materials and a school environment and in that cause
has created guided introductions to AM collections  Loud demand from the
educational community  chiefly from teachers working with the upper
grades of elementary school through high school greeted the announcement
that AM would be tested around the country

FREEMAN reported not only on what was learned about AM in a school
environment but also on several universal questions that were raised
concerning archival electronic resources in schools  She discussed
several strengths of this type of material in a school environment as
opposed to a highly structured resource that offers a limited number of
paths to follow

FREEMAN first raised several questions about using AM in a school
environment  There is often some difficulty in developing a sense of
what the system contains  Many students sit down at a computer resource
and assume that because AM comes from the Library of Congress all of
American history is now at their fingertips  As a result of that sort of
mistaken judgment some students are known to conclude that AM contains
nothing of use to them when they look for one or two things and do not
find them  It is difficult to discover that middle ground where one has
a sense of what the system contains  Some students grope toward the idea
of an archive a new idea to them since they have not previously
experienced what it means to have access to a vast body of somewhat
random information

Other questions raised by FREEMAN concerned the electronic format itself
For instance in a school environment it is often difficult both for
teachers and students to gain a sense of what it is they are viewing
They understand that it is a visual image but they do not necessarily
know that it is a postcard from the turn of the century a panoramic
photograph or even machinereadable text of an eighteenthcentury
broadside a twentiethcentury printed book or a nineteenthcentury
diary  That distinction is often difficult for people in a school
environment to grasp  Because of that it occasionally becomes difficult
to draw conclusions from what one is viewing

FREEMAN also noted the obvious fear of the computer which constitutes a
difficulty in using an electronic resource  Though students in general
did not suffer from this anxiety several older students feared that they
were computerilliterate an assumption that became selffulfilling when
they searched for something but failed to find it  FREEMAN said she
believed that some teachers also fear computer resources because they
believe they lack complete control  FREEMAN related the example of
teachers shooing away students because it was not their time to use the
system  This was a case in which the situation had to be extremely
structured so that the teachers would not feel that they had lost their
grasp on what the system contained

A final question raised by FREEMAN concerned access and availability of
the system  She noted the occasional existence of a gap in communication
between school librarians and teachers  Often AM sits in a school
library and the librarian is the person responsible for monitoring the
system  Teachers do not always take into their world new library
resources about which the librarian is excited  Indeed at the sites
where AM had been used most effectively within a library the librarian
was required to go to specific teachers and instruct them in its use  As
a result several AM sites will have inservice sessions over a summer
in the hope that perhaps with a more individualized link teachers will
be more likely to use the resource

A related issue in the school context concerned the number of
workstations available at any one location  Centralization of equipment
at the district level with teachers invited to download things and walk
away with them proved unsuccessful because the hours these offices were
open were also school hours

Another issue was hardware  As VECCIA observed a range of sites exists
some technologically advanced and others essentially acquiring their
first computer for the primary purpose of using it in conjunction with
AMs testing  Users at technologically sophisticated sites want even
more sophisticated hardware so that they can perform even more
sophisticated tasks with the materials in AM  But once they acquire a
newer piece of hardware they must learn how to use that also at an
unsophisticated site it takes an extremely long time simply to become
accustomed to the computer not to mention the program offered with the
computer  All of these small issues raise one large question namely
are systems like AM truly rewarding in a school environment or do they
simply act as innovative toys that do little more than spark interest?

FREEMAN contended that the evaluation project has revealed several strengths
that were gained through the use of archival resources in schools including

      Psychic rewards from using AM as a vast rich database with
     teachers assigning various projects to studentsoral presentations
     written reports a documentary a turnofthecentury newspaper
     projects that start with the materials in AM but are completed using
     other resources AM thus is used as a research tool in conjunction
     with other electronic resources as well as with books and items in
     the library where the system is set up

      Students are acquiring computer literacy in a humanities context

      This sort of system is overcoming the isolation between disciplines
     that often exists in schools  For example many English teachers are
     requiring their students to write papers on historical topics
     represented in AM  Numerous teachers have reported that their
     students are learning critical thinking skills using the system

      On a broader level AM is introducing primary materials not only
     to students but also to teachers in an environment where often
     simply none existan exciting thing for the students because it
     helps them learn to conduct research to interpret and to draw
     their own conclusions  In learning to conduct research and what it
     means students are motivated to seek knowledge  That relates to
     another positive outcomea high level of personal involvement of
     students with the materials in this system and greater motivation to
     conduct their own research and draw their own conclusions

      Perhaps the most ironic strength of these kinds of archival
     electronic resources is that many of the teachers AM interviewed
     were desperate it is no exaggeration to say not only for primary
     materials but for unstructured primary materials  These would they
     thought foster personally motivated research exploration and
     excitement in their students  Indeed these materials have done
     just that  Ironically however this lack of structure produces
     some of the confusion to which the newness of these kinds of
     resources may also contribute  The key to effective use of archival
     products in a school environment is a clear effective introduction
     to the system and to what it contains

                                 


DISCUSSION  Nothing known quantitatively about the number of
humanities scholars who must see the original versus those who would
settle for an edited transcript or about the ways in which humanities
scholars are using information technology  Firm conclusions concerning
the manner and extent of the use of supporting materials in print
provided by AM to await completion of evaluative study  A listeners
reflections on additional applications of electronic texts  Role of
electronic resources in teaching elementary research skills to students 


During the discussion that followed the presentations by MICHELSON
VECCIA and FREEMAN additional points emerged

LESK asked if MICHELSON could give any quantitative estimate of the
number of humanities scholars who must see or want to see the original
or the best possible version of the material versus those who typically
would settle for an edited transcript  While unable to provide a figure
she offered her impressions as an archivist who has done some reference
work and has discussed this issue with other archivists who perform
reference that those who use archives and those who use primary sources
for what would be considered very highlevel scholarly research as
opposed to say undergraduate papers were few in number especially
given the public interest in using primary sources to conduct
genealogical or avocational research and the kind of professional
research done by people in private industry or the federal government
More important in MICHELSONs view was that quantitatively nothing is
known about the ways in which for example humanities scholars are using
information technology  No studies exist to offer guidance in creating
strategies  The most recent study was conducted in  by the American
Council of Learned Societies ACLS and what it showed was that 
percent of humanities scholars at that time were using computers  That
constitutes the extent of our knowledge

Concerning AMs strategy for orienting people toward the scope of
electronic resources FREEMAN could offer no hard conclusions at this
point because she and her colleagues were still waiting to see
particularly in the schools what has been made of their efforts  Within
the system however AM has provided what are called electronic exhibits
such as introductions to time periods and materialsand these are
intended to offer a student user a sense of what a broadside is  and what
it might tell her or him  But FREEMAN conceded that the project staff
would have to talk with students next year after teachers have had a
summer to use the materials and attempt to discover what the students
were learning from the materials  In addition FREEMAN described
supporting materials in print provided by AM at the request of local
teachers during a meeting held at LC  These included time lines
bibliographies and other materials that could be reproDDKIG TR H
