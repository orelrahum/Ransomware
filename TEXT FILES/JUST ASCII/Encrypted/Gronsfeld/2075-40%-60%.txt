Satan was now at hand and from his seat
The monster moving onward came as fast
With horrid strides Hell trembled as he strode
Th undaunted Fiend what this might be admired
Admired not feared God and his Son except
Created thing naught valued he nor shunned
And with disdainful look thus first began
  "Whence and what art thou execrable Shape
That darst though grim and terrible advance
Thy miscreated front athwart my way
To yonder gates? Through them I mean to pass
That be assured without leave asked of thee
Retire or taste thy folly and learn by proof
Hellborn not to contend with Spirits of Heaven"
  To whom the Goblin full of wrath replied
"Art thou that traitor Angel? art thou he
Who first broke peace in Heaven and faith till then
Unbroken and in proud rebellious arms
Drew after him the third part of Heavens sons
Conjured against the Highestfor which both thou
And they outcast from God are here condemned
To waste eternal days in woe and pain?
And reckonst thou thyself with Spirits of Heaven
Helldoomed and breathst defiance here and scorn
Where I reign king and to enrage thee more
Thy king and lord? Back to thy punishment
False fugitive and to thy speed add wings
Lest with a whip of scorpions I pursue
Thy lingering or with one stroke of this dart
Strange horror seize thee and pangs unfelt before"
  So spake the grisly Terror and in shape
So speaking and so threatening grew tenfold
More dreadful and deform On th other side
Incensed with indignation Satan stood
Unterrified and like a comet burned
That fires the length of Ophiuchus huge
In th arctic sky and from his horrid hair
Shakes pestilence and war Each at the head
Levelled his deadly aim their fatal hands
No second stroke intend and such a frown
Each cast at th other as when two black clouds
With heavens artillery fraught came rattling on
Over the Caspianthen stand front to front
Hovering a space till winds the signal blow
To join their dark encounter in midair
So frowned the mighty combatants that Hell
Grew darker at their frown so matched they stood
For never but once more was wither like
To meet so great a foe And now great deeds
Had been achieved whereof all Hell had rung
Had not the snaky Sorceress that sat
Fast by Hellgate and kept the fatal key
Risen and with hideous outcry rushed between
  "O father what intends thy hand" she cried
"Against thy only son? What fury O son
Possesses thee to bend that mortal dart
Against thy fathers head? And knowst for whom?
For him who sits above and laughs the while
At thee ordained his drudge to execute
Whateer his wrath which he calls justice bids
His wrath which one day will destroy ye both"
  She spake and at her words the hellish Pest
Forbore then these to her Satan returned
  "So strange thy outcry and thy words so strange
Thou interposest that my sudden hand
Prevented spares to tell thee yet by deeds
What it intends till first I know of thee
What thing thou art thus doubleformed and why
In this infernal vale first met thou callst
Me father and that phantasm callst my son
I know thee not nor ever saw till now
Sight more detestable than him and thee"
  T whom thus the Portress of Hellgate replied
"Hast thou forgot me then and do I seem
Now in thine eye so foul?once deemed so fair
In Heaven when at th assembly and in sight
Of all the Seraphim with thee combined
In bold conspiracy against Heavens King
All on a sudden miserable pain
Surprised thee dim thine eyes and dizzy swum
In darkness while thy head flames thick and fast
Threw forth till on the left side opening wide
Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright
Then shining heavenly fair a goddess armed
Out of thy head I sprung Amazement seized
All th host of Heaven back they recoiled afraid
At first and called me Sin and for a sign
Portentous held me but familiar grown
I pleased and with attractive graces won
The most aversethee chiefly who full oft
Thyself in me thy perfect image viewing
Becamst enamoured and such joy thou tookst
With me in secret that my womb conceived
A growing burden Meanwhile war arose
And fields were fought in Heaven wherein remained
For what could else? to our Almighty Foe
Clear victory to our part loss and rout
Through all the Empyrean Down they fell
Driven headlong from the pitch of Heaven down
Into this Deep and in the general fall
I also at which time this powerful key
Into my hands was given with charge to keep
These gates for ever shut which none can pass
Without my opening Pensive here I sat
Alone but long I sat not till my womb
Pregnant by thee and now excessive grown
Prodigious motion felt and rueful throes
At last this odious offspring whom thou seest
Thine own begotten breaking violent way
Tore through my entrails that with fear and pain
Distorted all my nether shape thus grew
Transformed but he my inbred enemy
Forth issued brandishing his fatal dart
Made to destroy I fled and cried out Death
Hell trembled at the hideous name and sighed
From all her caves and back resounded Death
I fled but he pursued though more it seems
Inflamed with lust than rage and swifter far
Me overtook his mother all dismayed
And in embraces forcible and foul
Engendering with me of that rape begot
These yelling monsters that with ceaseless cry
Surround me as thou sawsthourly conceived
And hourly born with sorrow infinite
To me for when they list into the womb
That bred them they return and howl and gnaw
My bowels their repast then bursting forth
Afresh with conscious terrors vex me round
That rest or intermission none I find
Before mine eyes in opposition sits
Grim Death my son and foe who set them on
And me his parent would full soon devour
For want of other prey but that he knows
His end with mine involved and knows that I
Should prove a bitter morsel and his bane
Whenever that shall be so Fate pronounced
But thou O father I forewarn thee shun
His deadly arrow neither vainly hope
To be invulnerable in those bright arms
Through tempered heavenly for that mortal dint
Save he who reigns above none can resist"
  She finished and the subtle Fiend his lore
Soon learned now milder and thus answered smooth
  "Dear daughtersince thou claimst me for thy sire
And my fair son here showst me the dear pledge
Of dalliance had with thee in Heaven and joys
Then sweet now sad to mention through dire change
Befallen us unforeseen unthoughtofknow
I come no enemy but to set free
From out this dark and dismal house of pain
Both him and thee and all the heavenly host
Of Spirits that in our just pretences armed
Fell with us from on high From them I go
This uncouth errand sole and one for all
Myself expose with lonely steps to tread
Th unfounded Deep and through the void immense
To search with wandering quest a place foretold
Should beand by concurring signs ere now
Created vast and rounda place of bliss
In the purlieus of Heaven and therein placed
A race of upstart creatures to supply
Perhaps our vacant room though more removed
Lest Heaven surcharged with potent multitude
Might hap to move new broils Be this or aught
Than this more secret now designed I haste
To know and this once known shall soon return
And bring ye to the place where thou and Death
Shall dwell at ease and up and down unseen
Wing silently the buxom air embalmed
With odours There ye shall be fed and filled
Immeasurably all things shall be your prey"
  He ceased for both seemed highly pleased and Death
Grinned horrible a ghastly smile to hear
His famine should be filled and blessed his maw
Destined to that good hour No less rejoiced
His mother bad and thus bespake her sire
  "The key of this infernal Pit by due
And by command of Heavens allpowerful King
I keep by him forbidden to unlock
These adamantine gates against all force
Death ready stands to interpose his dart
Fearless to be oermatched by living might
But what owe I to his commands above
Who hates me and hath hither thrust me down
Into this gloom of Tartarus profound
To sit in hateful office here confined
Inhabitant of Heaven and heavenly born
Here in perpetual agony and pain
With terrors and with clamours compassed round
Of mine own brood that on my bowels feed?
Thou art my father thou my author thou
My being gavst me whom should I obey
But thee? whom follow? Thou wilt bring me soon
To that new world of light and bliss among
The gods who live at ease where I shall reign
At thy right hand voluptuous as beseems
Thy daughter and thy darling without end"
  Thus saying from her side the fatal key
Sad instrument of all our woe she took
And towards the gate rolling her bestial train
Forthwith the huge portcullis high updrew
Which but herself not all the Stygian Powers
Could once have moved then in the keyhole turns
Th intricate wards and every bolt and bar
Of massy iron or solid rock with ease
Unfastens On a sudden open fly
With impetuous recoil and jarring sound
Th infernal doors and on their hinges grate
Harsh thunder that the lowest bottom shook
Of Erebus She opened but to shut
Excelled her power the gates wide open stood
That with extended wings a bannered host
Under spread ensigns marching mibht pass through
With horse and chariots ranked in loose array
So wide they stood and like a furnacemouth
Cast forth redounding smoke and ruddy flame
Before their eyes in sudden view appear
The secrets of the hoary Deepa dark
Illimitable ocean without bound
Without dimension where length breadth and height
And time and place are lost where eldest Night
And Chaos ancestors of Nature hold
Eternal anarchy amidst the noise
Of endless wars and by confusion stand
For Hot Cold Moist and Dry four champions fierce
Strive here for mastery and to battle bring
Their embryon atoms they around the flag
Of each his factioU RV YPGIA AIYJVHU KQIPS
