Book XII


As one who in his journey bates at noon
Though bent on speed so here the ArchAngel paused
Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose
Then with transition sweet new speech resumes
Thus thou hast seen one world begin and end
And Man as from a second stock proceed
Much thou hast yet to see but I perceive
Thy mortal sight to fail objects divine
Must needs impair and weary human sense
Henceforth what is to come I will relate
Thou therefore give due audience and attend
This second source of Men while yet but few
And while the dread of judgement past remains
Fresh in their minds fearing the Deity
With some regard to what is just and right
Shall lead their lives and multiply apace
Labouring the soil and reaping plenteous crop
Corn wine and oil and from the herd or flock
Oft sacrificing bullock lamb or kid
With large wineofferings poured and sacred feast
Shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell
Long time in peace by families and tribes
Under paternal rule till one shall rise
Of proud ambitious heart who not content
With fair equality fraternal state
Will arrogate dominion undeserved
Over his brethren and quite dispossess
Concord and law of nature from the earth
Hunting and men not beasts shall be his game
With war and hostile snare such as refuse
Subjection to his empire tyrannous
A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled
Before the Lord as in despite of Heaven
Or from Heaven claiming second sovranty
And from rebellion shall derive his name
Though of rebellion others he accuse
He with a crew whom like ambition joins
With him or under him to tyrannize
Marching from Eden towards the west shall find
The plain wherein a black bituminous gurge
Boils out from under ground the mouth of Hell
Of brick and of that stuff they casA CW GCKLM
