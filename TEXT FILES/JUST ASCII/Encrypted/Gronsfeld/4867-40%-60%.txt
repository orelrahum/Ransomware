Or proud return though to his heavier doom
Yet with revenge accomplishd and to Hell
Draw after him the whole race of mankind
By him corrupted?  or wilt thou thyself
Abolish thy creation and unmake
For him what for thy glory thou hast made?
So should thy goodness and thy greatness both
Be questiond and blasphemd without defence
To whom the great Creator thus replied
O son in whom my soul hath chief delight
Son of my bosom Son who art alone
My word my wisdom and effectual might
All hast thou spoken as my thoughts are all
As my eternal purpose hath decreed
Man shall not quite be lost but savd who will
Yet not of will in him but grace in me
Freely vouchsafd once more I will renew
His lapsed powers though forfeit and enthralld
By sin to foul exorbitant desires
Upheld by me yet once more he shall stand
On even ground against his mortal foe
By me upheld that he may know how frail
His fallen condition is and to me owe
All his deliverance and to none but me
Some I have chosen of peculiar grace
Elect above the rest so is my will
The rest shall hear me call and oft be warnd
Their sinful state and to appease betimes
The incensed Deity while offerd grace
Invites for I will clear their senses dark
What may suffice and soften stony hearts
To pray repent and bring obedience due
To prayer repentance and obedience due
Though but endeavourd with sincere intent
Mine ear shall not be slow mine eye not shut
And I will place within them as a guide
My umpire Conscience whom if they will hear
Light after light well usd they shall attain
And to the end persisting safe arrive
This my long sufferance and my day of grace
They who neglect and scorn shall never taste
But hard be hardend blind be blinded more
That they may stumble on and deeper fall
And none but such from mercy I exclude
But yet all is not done Man disobeying
Disloyal breaks his fealty and sins
Against the high supremacy of Heaven
Affecting Godhead and so losing all
To expiate his treason hath nought left
But to destruction sacred and devote
He with his whole posterity must die
Die he or justice must unless for him
Some other able and as willing pay
The rigid satisfaction death for death
Say heavenly Powers where shall we find such love?
Which of you will be mortal to redeem
Mans mortal crime and just the unjust to save?
Dwells in all Heaven charity so dear?
And silence was in Heaven  on Mans behalf
He askd but all the heavenly quire stood mute
Patron or intercessour none appeard
Much less that durst upon his own head draw
The deadly forfeiture and ransom set
And now without redemption all mankind
Must have been lost adjudgd to Death and Hell
By doom severe had not the Son of God
In whom the fulness dwells of love divine
His dearest mediation thus renewd
Father thy word is past Man shall find grace
And shall grace not find means that finds her way
The speediest of thy winged messengers
To visit all thy creatures and to all
Comes unprevented unimplord unsought?
Happy for Man so coming he her aid
Can never seek once dead in sins and lost
Atonement for himself or offering meet
Indebted and undone hath none to bring
Behold me then  me for him life for life
I offer on me let thine anger fall
Account me Man I for his sake will leave
 Thy bosom and this glory next to thee
 Freely put off and for him lastly die
 Well pleased on me let Death wreak all his rage
 Under his gloomy power I shall not long
 Lie vanquished Thou hast given me to possess
 Life in myself for ever by thee I live
 Though now to Death I yield and am his due
 All that of me can die yet that debt paid
  thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave
 His prey nor suffer my unspotted soul
 For ever with corruption there to dwell
 But I shall rise victorious and subdue
 My vanquisher spoiled of his vaunted spoil
 Death his deaths wound shall then receive and stoop
 Inglorious of his mortal sting disarmed
 I through the ample air in triumph high
 Shall lead Hell captive maugre Hell and show
The powers of darkness bound Thou at the sight
 Pleased out of Heaven shalt look down and smile
 While by thee raised I ruin all my foes
 Death last and with his carcase glut the grave
 Then with the multitude of my redeemed
 Shall enter Heaven long absent and return
 Father to see thy face wherein no cloud
 Of anger shall remain but peace assured
 And reconcilement wrath shall be no more
 Thenceforth but in thy presence joy entire
 His words here ended but his meek aspect
 Silent yet spake and breathed immortal love
 To mortal men above which only shone
 Filial obedience as a sacrifice
 Glad to be offered he attends the will
 Of his great Father Admiration seized
