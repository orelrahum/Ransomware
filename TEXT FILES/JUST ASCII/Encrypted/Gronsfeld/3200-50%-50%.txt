HOCKEY posited the need to think about common methods of textencoding
for a long time to come because building these large bodies of text is
extremely expensive and will only be done once

In the more general discussion on approaches to encoding that followed
these points were made

BESSER identified the underlying problem with standards that all have to
struggle with in adopting a standard namely the tension between a very
highly defined standard that is very interchangeable but does not work
for everyone because something is lacking and a standard that is less
defined more open more adaptable but less interchangeable  Contending
that the way in which people use SGML is not sufficiently defined BESSER
wondered  if people resist the TEI because they think it is too defined
in certain things they do not fit into and  how progress with
interchangeability can be made without frightening people away

SPERBERGMcQUEEN replied that the published drafts of the TEI had met
with surprisingly little objection on the grounds that they do not allow
one to handle X or Y or Z  Particular concerns of the affiliated
projects have led in practice to discussions of how extensions are to
be made the primary concern of any project has to be how it can be
represented locally thus making interchange secondary  The TEI has
received much criticism based on the notion that everything in it is
required or even recommended which as it happens is a misconception
from the beginning   because none of it is required and very little is
actually actively recommended for all cases except that one document
ones source

SPERBERGMcQUEEN agreed with BESSER about this tradeoff  all the
projects in a set of twenty TEIconformant projects will not necessarily
tag the material in the same way  One result of the TEI will be that the
easiest problems will be solvedthose dealing with the external form of
the information but the problem that is hardest in interchange is that
one is not encoding what another wants and vice versa  Thus after
the adoption of a common notation the differences in the underlying
conceptions of what is interesting about texts become more visible
The success of a standard like the TEI will lie in the ability of
the recipient of interchanged texts to use some of what it contains
and to add the information that was not encoded that one wants in a
layered way so that texts can be gradually enriched and one does not
have to put in everything all at once  Hence having a wellbehaved
markup scheme is important

STEVENS followed up on the paradoxical analogy that BESSER alluded to in
the example of the MARC records namely the formats that are the same
except that they are different  STEVENS drew a parallel between
documenttype definitions and MARC records for books and serials and maps
where one has a tagging structure and there is a textinterchange
STEVENS opined that the producers of the information will set the terms
for the standard ie develop documenttype definitions for the users
of their products creating a situation that will be problematical for
an institution like the Library of Congress which will have to deal with
the DTDs in the event that a multiplicity of them develops  Thus
numerous people are seeking a standard but cannot find the tag set that
will be acceptable to them and their clients  SPERBERGMcQUEEN agreed
with this view and said that the situation was in a way worse  attempting
to unify arbitrary DTDs resembled attempting to unify a MARC record with a
bibliographic record done according to the Prussian instructions
According to STEVENS this situation occurred very early in the process

WATERS recalled from early discussions on Project Open Book the concern
of many people that merely by producing images POB was not really
enhancing intellectual access to the material  Nevertheless not wishing
to overemphasize the opposition between imaging and full text WATERS
stated that POB views getting the images as a first step toward possibly
converting to full text through character recognition if the technology
is appropriate  WATERS also emphasized that encoding is involved even
with a set of images

SPERBERGMcQUEEN agreed with WATERS that one can create an SGML document
consisting wholly of images  At first sight organizing graphic images
with an SGML document may not seem to offer great advantages but the
advantages of the scheme WATERS described would be precisely that
ability to move into something that is more of a multimedia document
a combination of transcribed text and page images  WEIBEL concurred in
this judgment offering evidence from Project ADAPT where a page is
divided into text elements and graphic elements and in fact the text
elements are organized by columns and lines  These lines may be used as
the basis for distributing documents in a network environment  As one
develops software intelligent enough to recognize what those elements
are it makes sense to apply SGML to an image initially that may in
fact ultimately become more and more text either through OCR or edited
OCR or even just through keying  For WATERS the labor of composing the
document and saying this set of documents or this set of images belongs
to this document constitutes a significant investment

WEIBEL also made the point that the AAP tag sets while not excessively
prescriptive offer a common starting point they do not define the
structure of the documents though  They have some recommendations about
DTDs one could use as examples but they do just suggest tag sets   For
example the CORE project attempts to use the AAP markup as much as
possible but there are clearly areas where structure must be added
That in no way contradicts the use of AAP tag sets

SPERBERGMcQUEEN noted that the TEI prepared a long working paper early
on about the AAP tag set and what it lacked that the TEI thought it
needed and a fairly long critique of the naming conventions which has
led to a very different style of naming in the TEI  He stressed the
importance of the opposition between prescriptive markup the kind that a
publisher or anybody can do when producing documents de novo and
descriptive markup in which one has to take what the text carrier
provides  In these particular tag sets it is easy to overemphasize this
opposition because the AAP tag set is extremely flexible  Even if one
just used the DTDs they allow almost anything to appear almost anywhere

                                 

SESSION VI  COPYRIGHT ISSUES


PETERS  Several cautions concerning copyright in an electronic
environment  Review of copyright law in the United States  The notion
of the public good and the desirability of incentives to promote it 
What copyright protects  Works not protected by copyright  The rights
of copyright holders  Publishers concerns in todays electronic
environment  Compulsory licenses  The price of copyright in a digital
medium and the need for cooperation  Additional clarifications   Rough
justice oftentimes the outcome in numerous copyright matters  Copyright
in an electronic society  Copyright law always only sets up the
boundaries anything can be changed by contract 


Marybeth PETERS policy planning adviser to the Register of Copyrights
Library of Congress   made several general comments and then opened the
floor to discussion of subjects of interest to the audience

Having attended several sessions in an effort to gain a sense of what
people did and where copyright would affect their lives PETERS expressed
the following cautions

      If one takes and converts materials and puts them in new forms
     then from a copyright point of view one is creating something and
     will receive some rights

      However if what one is converting already exists a question
     immediately arises about the status of the materials in question

      Putting something in the public domain in the United States offers
     some freedom from anxiety but distributing it throughout the world
     on a network is another matter even if one has put it in the public
     domain in the United States  Re foreign laws very frequently a
     work can be in the public domain in the United States but protected
     in other countries  Thus one must consider all of the places a
     work may reach lest one unwittingly become liable to being faced
     with a suit for copyright infringement or at least a letter
     demanding discussion of what one is doing

PETERS reviewed copyright law in the United States  The US
Constitution effectively states that Congress has the power to enact
copyright laws for two purposes   to encourage the creation and
dissemination of intellectual works for the good of society as a whole
and significantly  to give creators and those who package and
disseminate materials the economic rewards that are due them

Congress strives to strike a balance which at times can become an
emotional issue  The United States has never accepted the notion of the
natural right of an author so much as it has accepted the notion of the
public good and the desirability of incentives to promote it  This state
of affairs however has created strains on the international level and
is the reason for several of the differences in the laws that we have
Today the United States protects almost every kind of work that can be
called an expression of an author  The standard for gaining copyright
protection is simply originality  This is a low standard and means that
a work is not copied from something else as well as shows a certain
minimal amount of authorship  One can also acquire copyright protection
for making a new version of preexisting material provided it manifests
some spark of creativity

However copyright does not protect ideas methods systemsonly the way
that one expresses those things  Nor does copyright protect anything
that is mechanical anything that does not involve choice or criteria
concerning whether or not one should do a thing  For example the
results of a process called declicking in which one mechanically removes
impure sounds from old recordings are not copyrightable  On the other
hand the choice to record a song digitally and to increase the sound of
violins or to bring up the tympani constitutes the results of conversion
that are copyrightable  Moreover if a work is protected by copyright in
the United States one generally needs the permission of the copyright
owner to convert it  Normally who will own the newthat is converted
material is a matter of contract  In the absence of a contract the
person who creates the new material is the author and owner  But people
do not generally think about the copyright implications until after the
fact  PETERS stressed the need when dealing with copyrighted works to
think about copyright in advance  Ones bargaining power is much greater
up front than it is down the road

PETERS next discussed works not protected by copyright for example any
work done by a federal employee as part of his or her official duties is
in the public domain in the United States  The issue is not wholly free
of doubt concerning whether or not the work is in the public domain
outside the United States  Other materials in the public domain include
any works published more than seventyfive years ago and any work
published in the United States more than twentyeight years ago whose
copyright was not renewed  In talking about the new technology and
putting material in a digital form to send all over the world PETERS
cautioned one must keep in mind that while the rights may not be an
issue in the United States they may be in different parts of the world
where most countries previously employed a copyright term of the life of
the author plus fifty years

PETERS next reviewed the economics of copyright holding  Simply
economic rights are the rights to control the reproduction of a work in
any form  They belong to the author or in the case of a work made for
hire the employer  The second right which is critical to conversion
is the right to change a work  The right to make new versions is perhaps
one of the most significant rights of authors particularly in an
electronic world  The third right is the right to publish the work and
the right to disseminate it something that everyone who deals in an
electronic medium needs to know  The basic rule is if a copy is sold
all rights of distribution are extinguished with the sale of that copy
The key is that it must be sold  A number of companies overcome this
obstacle by leasing or renting their product  These companies argue that
if the material is rented or leased and not sold they control the uses
of a work  The fourth right and one very important in a digital world
is a right of public performance which means the right to show the work
sequentially  For example copyright owners control the showing of a
CDROM product in a public place such as a public library  The reverse
side of public performance is something called the right of public
display  Moral rights also exist which at the federal level apply only
to very limited visual works of art but in theory may apply under
contract and other principles  Moral rights may include the right of an
author to have his or her name on a work the right of attribution and
the right to object to distortion or mutilationthe right of integrity

The way copyright law is worded gives much latitude to activities such as
preservation to use of material for scholarly and research purposes when
the user does not make multiple copies and to the generation of
facsimile copies of unpublished works by libraries for themselves and
other libraries  But the law does not allow anyone to become the
distributor of the product for the entire world  In todays electronic
environment publishers are extremely concerned that the entire world is
networked and can obtain the information desired from a single copy in a
single library  Hence if there is to be only one sale which publishers
may choose to live with they will obtain their money in other ways for
example from access and use  Hence the development of site licenses
and other kinds of agreements to cover what publishers believe they
should be compensated for  Any solution that the United States takes
today has to consider the international arena

Noting that the United States is a member of the Berne Convention and
subscribes to its provisions PETERS described the permissions process
She also defined compulsory licenses  A compulsory license of which the
United States has had a few builds into the law the right to use a work
subject to certain terms and conditions  In the international arena
however the ability to use compulsory licenses is extremely limited
Thus clearinghouses and other collectives comprise one option that has
succeeded in providing for use of a work  Often overlooked when one
begins to use copyrighted material and put products together is how
expensive the permissions process and managing it is  According to
PETERS the price of copyright in a digital medium whatever solution is
worked out will include managing and assembling the database  She
strongly recommended that publishers and librarians or people with
various backgrounds cooperate to work out administratively feasible
systems in order to produce better results

In the lengthy questionandanswer period that followed PETERSs
presentation the following points emerged

      The Copyright Office maintains that anything mechanical and
     totally exhaustive probably is not protected  In the event that
     what an individual did in developing potentially copyrightable
     material is not understood the Copyright Office will ask about the
     creative choices the applicant chose to make or not to make  As a
     practical matter if one believes she or he has made enough of those
     choices that person has a right to assert a copyright and someone
     else must assert that the work is not copyrightable  The more
     mechanical the more automatic a thing is the less likely it is to
     be copyrightable

      Nearly all photographs are deemed to be copyrightable but no one
     worries about them much because everyone is free to take the same
     image  Thus a photographic copyright represents what is called a
     "thin" copyright  The photograph itself must be duplicated in
     order for copyright to be violated

      The Copyright Office takes the position that Xrays are not
     copyrightable because they are mechanical  It  can be argued
     whether or not image enhancement in scanning can be protected  One
     must exercise care with material created with public funds and
     generally in the public domain  An article written by a federal
     employee if written as part of official duties is not
     copyrightable  However control over a scientific article written
     by a National Institutes of Health grantee ie someone who
     receives money from the US government depends on NIH policy  If
     the government agency has no policy and that policy can be
     contained in its regulations the contract or the grant the
     author retains copyright  If a provision of the contract grant or
     regulation states that there will be no copyright then it does not
     exist  When a work is created copyright automatically comes into
     existence unless something exists that says it does not

      An enhanced electronic copy of a print copy of an older reference
     work in the public domain that does not contain copyrightable new
     material is a purely mechanical rendition of the original work and
     is not copyrightable

      Usually when a work enters the public domain nothing can remove
     it  For example Congress recently passed into law the concept of
     automatic renewal which means that copyright on any work published
     between l and l does not have to be renewed in order to
     receive a seventyfiveyear term  But any work not renewed before
      is in the public domain

      Concerning whether or not the United States keeps track of when
     authors die nothing was ever done nor is anything being done at
     the moment by the Copyright Office

      Software that drives a mechanical process is itself copyrightable
     If one changes platforms the software itself has a copyright  The
     World Intellectual Property Organization will hold a symposium 
     March through  April l at Harvard University on digital
     technology and will study this entire issue  If one purchases a
     computer software package such as MacPaint and creates something
     new one receives protection only for that which has been added

PETERS added that often in copyright matters rough justice is the
outcome for example in collective licensing ASCAP ie American
Society of Composers Authors and Publishers and BMI ie Broadcast
Music Inc where it may seem that the big guys receive more than their
due  Of course people ought not to copy a creative product without
paying for it there should be some compensation  But the truth of the
world and it is not a great truth is that the big guy gets played on
the radio more frequently than the little guy who has to do much more
until he becomes a big guy  That is true of every author every
composer everyone and unfortunately is part of life

Copyright always originates with the author except in cases of works
made for hire  Most software falls into this category  When an author
sends his article to a journal he has not relinquished copyright though
he retains the right to relinquish it  The author receives absolutely
everything  The less prominent the author the more leverage the
publisher will have in contract negotiations  In order to transfer the
rights the author must sign an agreement giving them away

In an electronic society it is important to be able to license a writer
and work out deals  With regard to use of a work it usually is much
easier when a publisher holds the rights  In an electronic era a real
problem arises when one is digitizing and making information available
PETERS referred again to electronic licensing clearinghouses  Copyright
ought to remain with the author but as one moves forward globally in the
electronic arena a middleman who can handle the various rights becomes
increasingly necessary

The notion of copyright law is that it resides with the individual but
in an online environment where a work can be adapted and tinkered with
by many individuals there is concern  If changes are authorized and
there is no agreement to the contrary the person who changes a work owns
the changes  To put it another way the person who acquires permission
to change a work technically will become the author and the owner unless
some agreement to the contrary has been made  It is typical for the
original publisher to try to control all of the versions and all of the
uses  Copyright law always only sets up the boundaries  Anything can be
changed by contract

                                 

SESSION VII  CONCLUSION


GENERAL DISCUSSION  Two questions for discussion  Different emphases in
the Workshop  Bringing the text and image partisans together 
Desiderata in planning the longterm development of something  Questions
surrounding the issue of electronic deposit  Discussion of electronic
deposit as an allusion to the issue of standards  Need for a directory
of preservation projects in digital form and for access to their
digitized files  CETHs catalogue of machinereadable texts in the
humanities  What constitutes a publication in the electronic world? 
Need for LC to deal with the concept of online publishing  LCs Network
Development Office  exploring the limits of MARC as a standard in terms
of handling electronic information  Magnitude of the problem and the
need for distributed responsibility in order to maintain and store
electronic information  Workshop participants to be viewed as a starting
point  Development of a network version of AM urged  A step toward AMs
construction of some sort of apparatus for network access  A delicate
and agonizing policy question for LC  Re the issue of electronic
deposit LC urged to initiate a catalytic process in terms of distributed
responsibility  Suggestions for cooperative ventures  Commercial
publishers fears  Strategic questions for getting the image and text
people to think through longterm cooperation  Clarification of the
driving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects 


In his role as moderator of the concluding session GIFFORD raised two
questions he believed would benefit from discussion   Are there enough
commonalities among those of us that have been here for two days so that
we can see courses of action that should be taken in the future?  And if
so what are they and who might take them?   Partly derivative from
that but obviously very dangerous to LC as host do you see a role for
the Library of Congress in all this?  Of course the Library of Congress
holds a rather special status in a number of these matters because it is
not perceived as a player with an economic stake in them but are there
roles that LC can play that can help advance us toward where we are heading?

Describing himself as an uninformed observer of the technicalities of the
last two days GIFFORD detected three different emphases in the Workshop
 people who are very deeply committed to text  people who are almost
passionate about images and  a few people who are very committed to
what happens to the networks  In other words the new networking
dimension the accessibility of the processability the portability of
all this across the networks  How do we pull those three together?

Adding a question that reflected HOCKEYs comment that this was the
fourth workshop she had attended in the previous thirty days FLEISCHHAUER
wondered to what extent this meeting had reinvented the wheel or if it
had contributed anything in the way of bringing together a different group
of people from those who normally appear on the workshop circuit

HOCKEY confessed to being struck at this meeting and the one the
Electronic Pierce Consortium organized the previous week that this was a
coming together of people working on texts and not images  Attempting to
bring the two together is something we ought to be thinking about for the
future  How one can think about working with image material to begin
with but structuring it and digitizing it in such a way that at a later
stage it can be interpreted into text and find a common way of building
text and images together so that they can be used jointly in the future
with the network support to begin there because that is how people will
want to access it

In planning the longterm development of something which is what is
being done in electronic text HOCKEY stressed the importance not only
of discussing the technical aspects of how one does it but particularly
of thinking about what the people who use the stuff will want to do
But conversely there are numerous things that people start to do with
electronic text or material that nobody ever thought of in the beginning

LESK in response to the question concerning the role of the Library of
Congress remarked the often suggested desideratum of having electronic
deposit  Since everything is now computertypeset an entire decade of
material that was machinereadable exists but the publishers frequently
did not save it has LC taken any action to have its copyright deposit
operation start collecting these machinereadable versions?  In the
absence of PETERS GIFFORD replied that the question was being
actively considered but that that was only one dimension of the problem
Another dimension is the whole question of the integrity of the original
electronic document  It becomes highly important in science to prove
authorship  How will that be done?

ERWAY explained that under the old policy to make a claim for a
copyright for works that were published in electronic form including
software one had to submit a paper copy of the first and laSC BAHSXF
