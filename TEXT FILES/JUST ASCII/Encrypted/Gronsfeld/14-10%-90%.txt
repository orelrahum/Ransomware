DISCUSSION  Nothing known quantitatively about the number of
humanities scholars who must see the original versus those who would
settle for an edited transcript or about the ways in which humanities
scholars are using information technology  Firm conclusions concerning
the manner and extent of the use of supporting materials in print
provided by AM to await completion of evaluative study  A listeners
reflections on additional applications of electronic texts  Role of
electronic resources in teaching elementary research skills to students 


During the discussion that followed the presentations by MICHELSON
VECCIA and FREEMAN additional points emerged

LESK asked if MICHELSON could give any quantitative estimate of the
number of humanities scholars who must see or want to see the original
or the best possible version of the material versus those who typically
would settle for an edited transcript  While unable to provide a figure
she offered her impressions as an archivist who has done some reference
work and has discussed this issue with other archivists who perform
reference that those who use archives and those who use primary sources
for what would be considered very highlevel scholarly research as
opposed to say undergraduate papers were few in number especially
given the public interest in using primary sources to conduct
genealogical or avocational research and the kind of professional
research done by people in private industry or the federal government
More important in MICHELSONs view was that quantitatively nothing is
known about the ways in which for example humanities scholars are using
information technology  No studies exist to offer guidance in creating
strategies  The most recent study was conducted in  by the American
Council of Learned Societies ACLS and what it showed was that 
percent of humanities scholars at that time were using computers  That
constitutes the extent of our knowledge

Concerning AMs strategy for orienting people toward the scope of
electronic resources FREEMAN could offer no hard conclusions at this
point because she and her colleagues were still waiting to see
particularly in the schools what has been made of their efforts  Within
the system however AM has provided what are called electronic exhibits
such as introductions to time periods and materialsand these are
intended to offer a student user a sense of what a broadside is  and what
it might tell her or him  But FREEMAN conceded that the project staff
would have to talk with students next year after teachers have had a
summer to use the materials and attempt to discover what the students
were learning from the materials  In addition FREEMAN described
supporting materials in print provided by AM at the request of local
teachers during a meeting held at LC  These included time lines
bibliographies and other materials that could be reproduced on a
photocopier in a classroom  Teachers could walk away with and use these
and in this way gain a better understanding of the contents  But again
reaching firm conclusions concerning the manner and extent of their use
would have to wait until next year

As to the changes she saw occurring at the National Archives and Records
Administration NARA as a result of the increasing emphasis on
technology in scholarly research MICHELSON stated that NARA at this
point was absorbing the report by her and Jeff Rothenberg addressing
strategies for the archival profession in general although not for the
National Archives specifically  NARA is just beginning to establish its
role and what it can do  In terms of changes and initiatives that NARA
can take no clear response could be given at this time

GREENFIELD remarked two trends mentioned in the session  Reflecting on
DALYs opening comments on how he could have used a Latin collection of
text in an electronic form he said that at first he thought most scholars
would be unwilling to do that  But as he thought of that in terms of the
original meaning of researchthat is having already mastered these texts
researching them for critical and comparative purposesfor the first time
the electronic format made a lot of sense  GREENFIELD could envision
growing numbers of scholars learning the new technologies for that very
aspect of their scholarship and for conveniences sake

Listening to VECCIA and FREEMAN GREENFIELD thought of an additional
application of electronic texts  He realized that AM could be used as a
guide to lead someone to original sources  Students cannot be expected
to have mastered these sources things they have never known about
before  Thus AM is leading them in theory to a vast body of
information and giving them a superficial overview of it enabling them
to select parts of it  GREENFIELD asked if any evidence exists that this
resource will indeed teach the new user the K students how to do
research  Scholars already know how to do research and are applying
these new tools  But he wondered why students would go beyond picking
out things that were most exciting to them

FREEMAN conceded the correctness of GREENFIELDs observation as applied
to a school environment  The risk is that a student would sit down at a
system play with it find some things of interest and then walk away
But in the relatively controlled situation of a school library much will
depend on the instructions a teacher or a librarian gives a student  She
viewed the situation not as one of finetuning research skills but of
involving students at a personal level in understanding and researching
things  Given the guidance one can receive at school it then becomes
possible to teach elementary research skills to students which in fact
one particular librarian said she was teaching her fifth graders
FREEMAN concluded that introducing the idea of following ones own path
of inquiry which is essentially what research entails involves more
than teaching specific skills  To these comments VECCIA added the
observation that the individual teacher and the use of a creative
resource rather than AM itself seemed to make the key difference
Some schools and some teachers are making excellent use of the nature
of critical thinking and teaching skills she said

Concurring with these remarks DALY closed the session with the thought that
the more that producers produced for teachers and for scholars to use with
their students the more successful their electronic products would prove

                                 

SESSION II  SHOW AND TELL

Jacqueline HESS director National Demonstration Laboratory served as
moderator of the "showandtell" session  She noted that a
questionandanswer period would follow each presentation


MYLONAS  Overview and content of Perseus  Perseus primary materials
exist in a systemindependent archival form  A concession  Textual
aspects of Perseus  Tools to use with the Greek text  Prepared indices
and fulltext searches in Perseus  EnglishGreek word search leads to
close study of words and concepts  Navigating Perseus by tracing down
indices  Using the iconography to perform research 


Elli MYLONAS managing editor Perseus Project Harvard University first
gave an overview of Perseus a large collaborative effort based at
Harvard University but with contributors and collaborators located at
numerous universities and colleges in the United States eg Bowdoin
Maryland Pomona Chicago Virginia  Funded primarily by the
AnnenbergCPB Project with additional funding from Apple Harvard and
the Packard Humanities Institute among others Perseus is a multimedia
hypertextual database for teaching and research on classical Greek
civilization which was released in February  in version  and
distributed by Yale University Press

Consisting entirely of primary materials Perseus includes ancient Greek
texts and translations of those texts catalog entriesthat is museum
catalog entries not library catalog entrieson vases sites coins
sculpture and archaeological objects maps and a dictionary among
other sources  The number of objects and the objects for which catalog
entries exist are accompanied by thousands of color images which
constitute a major feature of the database  Perseus contains
approximately  megabytes of text an amount that will double in
subsequent versions  In addition to these primary materials the Perseus
Project has been building tools for using them making access and
navigation easier the goal being to build part of the electronic
environment discussed earlier in the morning in which students or
scholars can work with their sources

The demonstration of Perseus will show only a fraction of the real work
that has gone into it because the project had to face the dilemma of
what to enter when putting something into machinereadable form  should
one aim for very high quality or make concessions in order to get the
material in?  Since Perseus decided to opt for very high quality all of
its primary materials exist in a systemindependentinsofar as it is
possible to be systemindependentarchival form  Deciding what that
archival form would be and attaining it required much work and thought
For example all the texts are marked up in SGML which will be made
compatible with the guidelines of the Text Encoding Initiative TEI when
they are issued

Drawings are postscript files not meeting international standards but
at least designed to go across platforms  Images or rather the real
archival forms consist of the best available slides which are being
digitized  Much of the catalog material exists in database forma form
that the average user could use manipulate and display on a personal
computer but only at great cost  Thus this is where the concession
comes in  All of this rich wellmarkedup information is stripped of
much of its content the images are converted into bitmaps and the text
into small formatted chunks  All this information can then be imported
into HyperCard and run on a midrange Macintosh which is what Perseus
users have  This fact has made it possible for Perseus to attain wide
use fairly rapidly  Without those archival forms the HyperCard version
being demonstrated could not be made easily and the project could not
have the potential to move to other forms and machines and software as
they appear none of which information is in Perseus on the CD

Of the numerous multimedia aspects of Perseus MYLONAS focused on the
textual  Part of what makes Perseus such a pleasure to use MYLONAS
said is this effort at seamless integration and the ability to move
around both visual and textual material  Perseus also made the decision
not to attempt to interpret its material any more than one interprets by
selecting  But MYLONAS emphasized Perseus is not courseware  No
syllabus exists  There is no effort to define how one teaches a topic
using Perseus although the project may eventually collect papers by
people who have used it to teach  Rather Perseus aims to provide
primary material in a kind of electronic library an electronic sandbox
so to say in which students and scholars who are working on this
material can explore by themselves  With that MYLONAS demonstrated
Perseus beginning with the Perseus gateway the first thing one sees
upon opening Perseusan effort in part to solve the contextualizing
problemwhich tells the user what the system contains

MYLONAS demonstrated only a very small portion beginning with primary
texts and running off the CDROM  Having selected Aeschylus Prometheus
Bound which was viewable in Greek and English pretty much in the same
segments together MYLONAS demonstrated tools to use with the Greek text
something not possible with a book  looking up the dictionary entry form
of an unfamiliar word in Greek after subjecting it to Perseus
morphological analysis for all the texts  After finding out about a
word a user may then decide to see if it is used anywhere else in Greek
Because vast amounts of indexing support all of the primary material one
can find out where else all forms of a particular Greek word appear
often not a trivial matter because Greek is highly inflected  Further
since the story of Prometheus has to do with the origins of sacrifice a
user may wish to study and explore sacrifice in Greek literature by
typing sacrifice into a small window a user goes to the EnglishGreek
word listsomething one cannot do without the computer Perseus has
indexed the definitions of its dictionarythe string sacrifice appears
in the definitions of these sixtyfive words  One may then find out
where any of those words is used in the works of a particular author
The English definitions are not lemmatized

All of the indices driving this kind of usage were originally devised for
speed MYLONAS observed in other words all that kind of information
all forms of all words where they exist the dictionary form they belong
towere collected into databases which will expedite searching  Then
it was discovered that one can do things searching in these databases
that could not be done searching in the full texts  Thus although there
are fulltext searches in Perseus much of the work is done behind the
scenes using prepared indices  Re the indexing that is done behind the
scenes MYLONAS pointed out that without the SGML forms of the text it
could not be done effectively  Much of this indexing is based on the
structures that are made explicit by the SGML tagging

It was found that one of the things many of Perseus nonGreekreading
users do is start from the dictionary and then move into the close study
of words and concepts via this kind of EnglishGreek word search by which
means they might select a concept  This exercise has been assigned to
students in core courses at Harvardto study a concept by looking for the
English word in the dictionary finding the Greek words and then finding
the words in the Greek but of course reading across in the English
That tells them a great deal about what a translation means as well

Should one also wish to see images that have to do with sacrifice that
person would go to the object key word search which allows one to
perform a similar kind of index retrieval on the database of
archaeological objects  Without words pictures are useless Perseus has
not reached the point where it can do much with images that are not
cataloged  Thus although it is possible in Perseus with text and images
to navigate by knowing where one wants to end upfor example a
redfigure vase from the Boston Museum of Fine Artsone can perform this
kind of navigation very easily by tracing down indices  MYLONAS
illustrated several generic scenes of sacrifice on vases  The features
demonstrated derived from Perseus  version  will implement even
better means of retrieval

MYLONAS closed by looking at one of the pictures and noting again that
one can do a great deal of research using the iconography as well as the
texts  For instance students in a core course at Harvard this year were
highly interested in Greek concepts of foreigners and representations of
nonGreeks  So they performed a great deal of research both with texts
eg Herodotus and with iconography on vases and coins on how the
Greeks portrayed nonGreeks  At the same time art historians who study
iconography were also interested and were able to use this material

                                 


DISCUSSION  Indexing and searchability of all English words in Perseus 
Several features of Perseus   Several levels of customization
possible  Perseus used for general education  Perseus effects on
education  Contextual information in Perseus  Main challenge and
emphasis of Perseus 


Several points emerged in the discussion that followed MYLONASs presentation

Although MYLONAS had not demonstrated Perseus ability to crosssearch
documents she confirmed that all English words in Perseus are indexed
and can be searched  So for example sacrifice could have been searched
in all texts the historical essay and all the catalogue entries with
their descriptionsin short in all of Perseus

Boolean logic is not in Perseus  but will be added to the next
version although an effort is being made not to restrict Perseus to a
database in which one just performs searching Boolean or otherwise  It
is possible to move laterally through the documents by selecting a word
one is interested in and selecting an area of information one is
interested in and trying to look that word up in that area

Since Perseus was developed in HyperCard several levels of customization
are possible  Simple authoring tools exist that allow one to create
annotated paths through the information which are useful for notetaking
and for guided tours for teaching purposes and for expository writing
With a little more ingenuity it is possible to begin to add or substitute
material in Perseus

Perseus has not been used so much for classics education as for general
education where it seemed to have an impact on the students in the core
course at Harvard a general required course that students must take in
certain areas  Students were able to use primary material much more

The Perseus Project has an evaluation team at the University of Maryland
that has been documenting Perseus effects on education  Perseus is very
popular and anecdotal evidence indicates that it is having an effect at
places other than Harvard for example test sites at Ball State
University Drury College and numerous small places where opportunities
to use vast amounts of primary data may not exist  One documented effect
is that archaeological anthropological and philological research is
being done by the same person instead of by three different people

The contextual information in Perseus includes an overview essay a
fairly linear historical essay on the fifth century BC that provides
links into the primary material eg Herodotus Thucydides and
Plutarch via small gray underscoring on the screen of linked
passages  These are handmade links into other material

To different extents most of the production work was done at Harvard
where the people and the equipment are located  Much of the
collaborative activity involved data collection and structuring because
the main challenge and the emphasis of Perseus is the gathering of
primary material that is building a useful environment for studying
classical Greece collecting data and making it useful
Systemsbuilding is definitely not the main concern  Thus much of the
work has involved writing essays collecting information rewriting it
and tagging it  That can be done off site  The creative link for the
overview essay as well as for both systems and data was collaborative
and was forged via Email and paper mail with professors at Pomona and
Bowdoin

                                 


CALALUCA  PLDs principal focus and contribution to scholarship 
Various questions preparatory to beginning the project  Basis for
project  Basic rule in converting PLD  Concerning the images in PLD 
Running PLD under a variety of retrieval softwares  Encoding the
database a hardfought issue  Various features demonstrated  Importance
of user documentation  Limitations of the CDROM version 


Eric CALALUCA vice president ChadwyckHealey Inc demonstrated a
software interpretation of the Patrologia Latina Database PLD  PLDs
principal focus from the beginning of the project about threeandahalf
years ago was on converting Mignes Latin series and in the end
CALALUCA suggested conversion of the text will be the major contribution
to scholarship  CALALUCA stressed that as possibly the only private
publishing organization at the Workshop ChadwyckHealey had sought no
federal funds or national foundation support before embarking upon the
project but instead had relied upon a great deal of homework and
marketing to accomplish the task of conversion

Ever since the possibilities of computersearching have emerged scholars
in the field of late ancient and early medieval studies philosophers
theologians classicists and those studying the history of natural law
and the history of the legal development of Western civilization have
been longing for a fully searchable version of Western literature for
example all the texts of Augustine and Bernard of Clairvaux and
Boethius not to mention all the secondary and tertiary authors

Various questions arose CALALUCA said  Should one convert Migne?
Should the database be encoded?  Is it necessary to do that?  How should
it be delivered?  What about CDROM?  Since this is a transitional
medium why even bother to create software to run on a CDROM?  Since
everybody knows people will be networking information why go to the
troublewhich is far greater with CDROM than with the production of
magnetic data?  Finally how does one make the data available?  Can many
of the hurdles to using electronic information that some publishers have
imposed upon databases be eliminated?

The PLD project was based on the principle that computersearching of
texts is most effective when it is done with a large database  Because
PLD represented a collection that serves so many disciplines across so
many periods it was irresistible

The basic rule in converting PLD was to do no harm to avoid the sins of
intrusion in such a database  no introduction of newer editions no
onthespot changes no eradicating of all possible falsehoods from an
edition  Thus PLD is not the final act in electronic publishing for
this discipline but simply the beginning  The conversion of PLD has
evoked numerous unanticipated questions  How will information be used?
What about networking?  Can the rights of a database be protected?
Should one protect the rights of a database?  How can it be made
available?

Those converting PLD also tried to avoid the sins of omission that is
excluding portions of the collections or whole sections  What about the
images?  PLD is full of images some are extremely pious
nineteenthcentury representations of the Fathers while others contain
highly interesting elements  The goal was to cover all the text of Migne
including notes in Greek and in Hebrew the latter of which in
particular causes problems in creating a search structure all the
indices and even the images which are being scanned in separately
searchable files

Several North American institutions that have placed acquisition requests
for the PLD database have requested it in magnetic form without software
which means they are already running it without software without
anything demonstrated at the Workshop

What cannot practically be done is go back and reconvert and reencode
data a timeconsuming and extremely costly enterprise  CALALUCA sees
PLD as a database that can and should be run under a variety of
retrieval softwares  This will permit the widest possible searches
Consequently the need to produce a CDROM of PLD as well as to develop
software that could handle some  gigabyte of heavily encoded text
developed out of conversations with collection development and reference
librarians who wanted software both compassionate enough for the
pedestrian but also capable of incorporating the most detailed
lexicographical studies that a user desires to conduct  In the end the
encoding and conversion of the data will prove the most enduring
testament to the value of the project

The encoding of the database was also a hardfought issue  Did the
database need to be encoded? Were there normative structures for encoding
humanist texts?  Should it be SGML?  What about the TEIwill it last
will it prove useful?  CALALUCA expressed some minor doubts as to whether
a data bank can be fully TEIconformant  Every effort can be made but
in the end to be TEIconformant means to accept the need to make some
firm encoding decisions that can indeed be disputed  The TEI points
the publisher in a proper direction but does not presume to make all the
decisions for him or her  Essentially the goal of encoding was to
eliminate as much as possible the hindrances to informationnetworking
so that if an institution acquires a database everybody associated with
the institution can have access to it

CALALUCA demonstrated a portion of Volume  because it had the most
anomalies in it  The software was created by Electronic Book
Technologies of Providence RI and is called Dynatext  The software
works only with SGMLcoded data

Viewing a table of contents on the screen the audience saw how Dynatext
treats each element as a book and attempts to simplify movement through a
volume  Familiarity with the Patrologia in print ie the text its
source and the editions will make the machinereadable versions highly
useful  Software with a Windows application was sought for PLD
CALALUCA said because this was the main trend for scholarly use

CALALUCA also demonstrated how a user can perform a variety of searches
and quickly move to any part of a volume the lookup screen provides
some basic simple wordsearching

CALALUCA argued that one of the major difficulties is not the software
Rather in creating a product that will be used by scholars representing
a broad spectrum of computer sophistication  user documentation proves
to be the most important service one can provide

CALALUCA next illustrated a truncated search under mysterium within ten
words of virtus and how one would be able to find its contents throughout
the entire database  He said that the exciting thing about PLD is that
many of the applications in the retrieval software being written for it
will exceed the capabilities of the software employed now for the CDROM
version  The CDROM faces genuine limitations in terms of speed and
comprehensiveness in the creation of a retrieval software to run it
CALALUCA said he hoped that individual scholars will download the data
if they wish to their personal computers and have ready access to
important texts on a constant basis which they will be able to use in
their research and from which they might even be able to publish

CALALUCA explained that the blue numbers represented Mignes column numbers
which are the standard scholarly references  Pulling up a note he stated
that these texts were heavily edited and the image files would appear simply
as a note as well so that one could quickly access an image

Various search and retrieval capabilities  Illustration of automatic
stemming and a truncated search  AMs attempt to find ways to connect
cataloging to the texts  AMs gravitation towards SGML  Striking a
balance between quantity and quality  How AM furnishes users recourse to
images  Conducting a search in a fulltext environment  Macintosh and
IBM prototypes of AM  Multimedia aspects of AM 


A demonstration of American Memory by its coordinator Carl FLEISCHHAUER
and Ricky ERWAY associate coordinator Library of Congress concluded
the morning session  Beginning with a collection of broadsides from the
Continental Congress and the Constitutional Convention the only text
collection in a presentable form at the time of the Workshop FLEISCHHAUER
highlighted several of the problems with which AM is still wrestling
In its final form the disk will contain two collections not only the
broadsides but also the full text with illustrations of a set of
approximately  AfricanAmerican pamphlets from the period  to 

As FREEMAN had explained earlier AM has attempted to use a small amount
of interpretation to introduce collections  In the present case the
contractor a company named Quick Source in Silver Spring MD used
software called Toolbook and put together a modestly interactive
introduction to the collection  Like the two preceding speakers
FLEISCHHAUER argued that the real asset was the underlying collection

FLEISCHHAUER proceeded to describe various search and retrieval
capabilities while ERWAY worked the computer  In this particular package
the "go to" pulldown allowed the user in effect to jump out of Toolbook
where the interactive program was located and enter the thirdparty
software used by AM for this text collection which is called Personal
Librarian  This was the Windows version of Personal Librarian a
software application put together by a company in Rockville Md

Since the broadsides came from the Revolutionary War period a search was
conducted using the words British or war with the default operator reset
as or  FLEISCHHAUER demonstrated both automatic stemming which finds
other forms of the same root and a truncated search  One of Personal
Librarians strongest features the relevance ranking was represented by
a chart that indicated how often words being sought appeared in
documents with the one receiving the most "hits" obtaining the highest
score  The "hit list" that is supplied takes the relevance ranking into
account making the first hit in effect the one the software has
selected as the most relevant example

While in the text of one of the broadside documents FLEISCHHAUER
remarked AMs attempt to find ways to connect cataloging to the texts
which it does in different ways in different manifestations  In the case
shown the cataloging was pasted on  AM took MARC records that were
written as online records right into one of the Librarys mainframe
retrieval programs pulled them out and handed them off to the contractor
who massaged them somewhat to display them in the manner shown  One of
AMs questions is Does the cataloguing normally performed in the mainframe
work in this context or had AM ought to think through adjustments?

FLEISCHHAUER made the additional point that as far as the text goes AM
has gravitated towards SGML he pointed to the boldface in the upper part
of the screen  Although extremely limited in its ability to translate
or interpret SGML Personal Librarian will furnish both bold and italics
on screen a fairly easy thing to do but it is one of the ways in which
SGML is useful

Striking a balance between quantity and quality has been a major concern
of AM with accuracy being one of the places where project staff have
felt that less than percent accuracy was not unacceptable
FLEISCHHAUER cited the example of the standard of the rekeying industry
namely  percent as one service bureau informed him to go from
 to  percent would double the cost

FLEISCHHAUER next demonstrated how AM furnishes users recourse to images
and at the same time recalled LESKs pointed question concerning the
number of people who would look at those images and the number who would
work only with the text  If the implication of LESKs question was
sound FLEISCHHAUER said it raised the stakes for text accuracy and
reduced the value of the strategy for images

Contending that preservation is always a bugaboo FLEISCHHAUER
demonstrated several images derived from a scan of a preservation
microfilm that AM had made  He awarded a grade of C at best perhaps a
C minus or a C plus for how well it worked out  Indeed the matter of
learning if other people had better ideas about scanning in general and
in particular scanning from microfilm was one of the factors that drove
AM to attempt to think through the agenda for the Workshop  Skew for
example was one of the issues that AM in its ignorance had not reckoned
would prove so difficult

Further the handling of images of the sort shown in a desktop computer
environment involved a considerable amount of zooming and scrolling
Ultimately AM staff feel that perhaps the paper copy that is printed out
might be the most useful one but they remain uncertain as to how much
onscreen reading users will do

Returning to the text FLEISCHHAUER asked viewers to imagine a person who
might be conducting a search in a fulltext environment  With this
scenario he proceeded to illustrate other features of Personal Librarian
that he considered helpful for example it provides the ability to
notice words as one reads  Clicking the "include" button on the bottom
of the search window pops the words that have been highlighted into the
search  Thus a user can refine the search as he or she reads
reexecuting the search and continuing to find things in the quest for
materials  This software not only contains relevance ranking Boolean
operators and truncation it also permits one to perform word algebra
so to say where one puts two or three words in parentheses and links
them with one Boolean operator and then a couple of words in another set
of parentheses and asks for thinKZ FQYPKN BW QDSC DXZIA QF XBLHWW
