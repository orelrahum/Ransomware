Some capital city or less than if this frame
Of Heaven were falling and these elements
In mutiny had from her axle torn
The steadfast Earth At last his sailbroad vans
He spread for flight and in the surging smoke
Uplifted spurns the ground thence many a league
As in a cloudy chair ascending rides
Audacious but that seat soon failing meets
A vast vacuity All unawares
Fluttering his pennons vain plumbdown he drops
Ten thousand fathom deep and to this hour
Down had been falling had not by ill chance
The strong rebuff of some tumultuous cloud
Instinct with fire and nitre hurried him
As many miles aloft That fury stayed
Quenched in a boggy Syrtis neither sea
Nor good dry landnigh foundered on he fares
Treading the crude consistence half on foot
Half flying behoves him now both oar and sail
As when a gryphon through the wilderness
With winged course oer hill or moory dale
Pursues the Arimaspian who by stealth
Had from his wakeful custody purloined
The guarded gold so eagerly the Fiend
Oer bog or steep through strait rough dense or rare
With head hands wings or feet pursues his way
And swims or sinks or wades or creeps or flies
At length a universal hubbub wild
Of stunning sounds and voices all confused
Borne through the hollow dark assaults his ear
With loudest vehemence Thither he plies
Undaunted to meet there whatever Power
Or Spirit of the nethermost Abyss
Might in that noise reside of whom to ask
Which way the nearest coast of darkness lies
Bordering on light when straight behold the throne
Of Chaos and his dark pavilion spread
Wide on the wasteful Deep With him enthroned
Sat sablevested Night eldest of things
The consort of his reign and by them stood
Orcus and Ades and the dreaded name
Of Demogorgon Rumour next and Chance
And Tumult and Confusion all embroiled
And Discord with a thousand various mouths
  T whom Satan turning boldly thus"Ye Powers
And Spirtis of this nethermost Abyss
Chaos and ancient Night I come no spy
With purpose to explore or to disturb
The secrets of your realm but by constraint
Wandering this darksome desert as my way
Lies through your spacious empire up to light
Alone and without guide half lost I seek
What readiest path leads where your gloomy bounds
Confine with Heaven or if some other place
From your dominion won th Ethereal King
Possesses lately thither to arrive
I travel this profound Direct my course
Directed no mean recompense it brings
To your behoof if I that region lost
All usurpation thence expelled reduce
To her original darkness and your sway
Which is my present journey and once more
Erect the standard there of ancient Night
Yours be th advantage all mine the revenge"
  Thus Satan and him thus the Anarch old
With faltering speech and visage incomposed
Answered  "I know thee stranger who thou art  
That mighty leading Angel who of late
Made head against Heavens King though overthrown
I saw and heard for such a numerous host
Fled not in silence through the frighted Deep
With ruin upon ruin rout on rout
Confusion worse confounded and HeavJVIACMW
