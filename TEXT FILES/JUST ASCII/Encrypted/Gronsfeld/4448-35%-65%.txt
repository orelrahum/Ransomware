To rule as over all he should have ruled
True is me also he hath judged or rather
Me not but the brute serpent in whose shape
Man I deceived that which to me belongs
Is enmity which he will put between
Me and mankind I am to bruise his heel
His seed when is not set shall bruise my head
A world who would not purchase with a bruise
Or much more grievous pain?Ye have the account
Of my performance  What remains ye Gods
But up and enter now into full bliss?
So having said a while he stood expecting
Their universal shout and high applause
To fill his ear when contrary he hears
On all sides from innumerable tongues
A dismal universal hiss the sound
Of publick scorn he wondered but not long
Had leisure wondering at himself now more
His visage drawn he felt to sharp and spare
His arms clung to his ribs his legs entwining
Each other till supplanted down he fell
A monstrous serpent on his belly prone
Reluctant but in vain a greater power
Now ruled him punished in the shape he sinned
According to his doom he would have spoke
But hiss for hiss returned with forked tongue
To forked tongue for now were all transformed
Alike to serpents all as accessories
To his bold riot  Dreadful was the din
Of hissing through the hall thick swarming now
With complicated monsters head and tail
Scorpion and Asp and Amphisbaena dire
Cerastes horned Hydrus and Elops drear
And Dipsas not so thick swarmed once the soil
Bedropt with blood of Gorgon or the isle
Ophiusa but still greatest he the midst
Now Dragon grown larger than whom the sun
Ingendered in the Pythian vale or slime
Huge Python and his power no less he seemed
Above the rest still to retain they all
Him followed issuing forth to the open field
Where all yet left of that revolted rout
Heavenfallen in station stood or just array
Sublime with expectation when to see
In triumph issuing forth their glorious Chief
They saw but other sight instead a croud
Of ugly serpents horrour on them fell
And horrid sympathy for what they saw
They felt themselves now changing down their arms
Down fell both spear and shield down they as fast
And the dire hiss renewed and the dire form
Catched by contagion like in punishment
As in their crime  Thus was the applause they meant
Turned to exploding hiss triumph to shame
Cast on themselves from their own mouths  There stood
A grove hard by sprung up with this their change
His will who reigns above to aggravate
Their penance laden with fair fruit like that
Which grew in Paradise the bait of Eve
Used by the Tempter on that prospect strange
Their earnest eyes they fixed imagining
For one forbidden tree a multitude
Now risen to work them further woe or shame
Yet parched with scalding thirst and hunger fierce
Though to delude them sent could not abstain
But on they rolled in heaps and up the trees
Climbing sat thicker than the snaky locks
That curled Megaera greedily they plucked
The fruitage fair to sight like that which grew
Near that bituminous lake where Sodom flamed
This more delusive not the touch but taste
Deceived they fondly thinking to allay
Their appetite with gust instead of fruit
Chewed bitter ashes which the offended taste
With spattering noise rejected oft they assayed
Hunger and thirst constraining drugged as oft
With hatefullest disrelish writhed their jaws
With soot and cinders filled so oft they fell
Into the same illusion not as Man
Whom they triumphed once lapsed  Thus were they plagued
And worn with famine long and ceaseless hiss
Till their lost shape permitted they resumed
Yearly enjoined some say to undergo
This annual humbling certain numbered days
To dash their pride and joy for Man seduced
However some tradition they dispersed
Among the Heathen of their purchase got
And fabled how the Serpent whom they called
Ophion with Eurynome the wide
Encroaching Eve perhaps had first the rule
Of high Olympus thence by Saturn driven
And Ops ere yet Dictaean LOEM ADX FVAV
