to be transcribed onto computer disks  Slides illustrated several of the
problems encountered for example the present inability of CDROM to
indicate the crossouts deleted material in eighteenth century
documents  TWOHIG next described documents from various periods in the
eighteenth century that have been transcribed in chronological order and
delivered to the Packard offices in California where they are converted
to the CDROM a process that is expected to consume five years to
complete that is reckoning from David Packards suggestion made several
years ago until about July   TWOHIG found an encouraging
indication of the projects benefits in the ongoing use made by scholars
of the search functions of the CDROM particularly in reducing the time
spent in manually turning the pages of the Washington papers

TWOHIG next furnished details concerning the accuracy of transcriptions
For instance the insertion of thousands of documents on the CDROM
currently does not permit each document to be verified against the
original manuscript several times as in the case of documents that appear
in the published edition  However the transcriptions receive a cursory
check for obvious typos the misspellings of proper names and other
errors from the WPP CDROM editor  Eventually all documents that appear
in the electronic version will be checked by project editors  Although
this process has met with opposition from some of the editors on the
grounds that imperfect work may leave their offices the advantages in
making this material available as a research tool outweigh  fears about the
misspelling of proper names and other relatively minor editorial matters

Completion of all five Founding Fathers projects ie retrievability
and searchability of all of the documents by proper names alternate
spellings or varieties of subjects will provide one of the richest
sources of this size for the history of the United States in the latter
part of the eighteenth century  Further publication on CDROM will
allow editors to include even minutiae such as laundry lists not
included in the printed volumes

It seems possible that the extensive annotation provided in the printed
volumes eventually will be added to the CDROM edition pending
negotiations with the publishers of the papers  At the moment the
Founding Fathers CDROM is accessible only on the IBYCUS a computer
developed out of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae project and designed for
the use of classical scholars  There are perhaps  IBYCUS computers in
the country most of which are in university classics departments
Ultimately it is anticipated that the CDROM edition of the Founding
Fathers documents will run on any IBMcompatible or Macintosh computer
with a CDROM drive  Numerous changes in the software will also occur
before the project is completed  Editors note an IBYCUS was
unavailable to demonstrate the CDROM

                                 


DISCUSSION  Several additional features of WPP clarified 


Discussion following TWOHIGs presentation served to clarify several
additional features including  that the projects primary
intellectual product consists in the electronic transcription of the
material  that the text transmitted to the CDROM people is not
marked up  that cataloging and subjectindexing of the material
remain to be worked out though at this point material can be retrieved
by name and  that because all the searching is done in the hardware
the IBYCUS is designed to read a CDROM which contains only sequential
text files  Technically it then becomes very easy to read the material
off and put it on another device

                                 


LEBRON  Overview of the history of the joint project between AAAS and
OCLC  Several practices the online environment shares with traditional
publishing on hard copy  Several technical and behavioral barriers to
electronic publishing  How AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of
clinical trials  Advantages of the electronic format and other features
of OJCCT  An illustrated tour of the journal 


Maria LEBRON managing editor The Online Journal of Current Clinical
Trials OJCCT presented an illustrated overview of the history of the
joint project between the American Association for the Advancement of
Science AAAS and the Online Computer Library Center Inc OCLC  The
joint venture between AAAS and OCLC owes its beginning to a
reorganization launched by the new chief executive officer at OCLC about
three years ago and combines the strengths of these two disparate
organizations  In short OJCCT represents the process of scholarly
publishing on line

LEBRON next discussed several practices the online environment shares
with traditional publishing on hard copyfor example peer review of
manuscriptsthat are highly important in the academic world  LEBRON
noted in particular the implications of citation counts for tenure
committees and grants committees  In the traditional hardcopy
environment citation counts are readily demonstrable whereas the
online environment represents an ethereal medium to most academics

LEBRON remarked several technical and behavioral barriers to electronic
publishing for instance the problems in transmission created by special
characters or by complex graphics and halftones  In addition she noted
economic limitations such as the storage costs of maintaining back issues
and market or audience education

Manuscripts cannot be uploaded to OJCCT LEBRON explained because it is
not a bulletin board or Email forms of electronic transmission of
information that have created an ambience clouding peoples understanding
of what the journal is attempting to do  OJCCT which publishes
peerreviewed medical articles dealing with the subject of clinical
trials includes text tabular material and graphics although at this
time it can transmit only line illustrations

Next LEBRON described how AAAS and OCLC arrived at the subject of
clinical trials  It is  a highly statistical discipline that  does
not require halftones but can satisfy the needs of its audience with line
illustrations and graphic material and  there is a need for the speedy
dissemination of highquality research results  Clinical trials are
research activities that involve the administration of a test treatment
to some experimental unit in order to test its usefulness before it is
made available to the general population  LEBRON proceeded to give
additional information on OJCCT concerning its editorinchief editorial
board editorial content and the types of articles it publishes
including peerreviewed research reports and reviews as well as
features shared by other traditional hardcopy journals

Among the advantages of the electronic format are faster dissemination of
information including raw data and the absence of space constraints
because pages do not exist  This latter fact creates an interesting
situation when it comes to citations  Nor are there any issues  AAASs
capacity to download materials directly from the journal to a
subscribers printer hard drive or floppy disk helps ensure highly
accurate transcription  Other features of OJCCT include onscreen alerts
that allow linkage of subsequently published documents to the original
documents online searching by subject author title etc indexing of
every single word that appears in an article viewing access to an
article by component abstract full text or graphs numbered
paragraphs to replace page counts publication in Science every thirty
days of indexing of all articles published in the journal
typesetquality screens and Hypertext links that enable subscribers to
bring up Medline abstracts directly without leaving the journal

After detailing the two primary ways to gain access to the journal
through the OCLC network and Compuserv if one desires graphics or through
the Internet if just an ASCII file is desired LEBRON illustrated the
speedy editorial process and the coding of the document using SGML tags
after it has been accepted for publication  She also gave an illustrated
tour of the journal its searchandretrieval capabilities in particular
but also including problems associated with scanning in illustrations
and the importance of onscreen alerts to the medical profession re
retractions or corrections or more frequently editorials letters to
the editors or followup reports  She closed by inviting the audience
to join AAAS on  July when OJCCT was scheduled to go online

                                 


DISCUSSION  Additional features of OJCCT 


In the lengthy discussion that followed LEBRONs presentation these
points emerged

      The SGML text can be tailored as users wish

      All these articles have a fairly simple document definition

      Documenttype definitions DTDs were developed and given to OJCCT
     for coding

      No articles will be removed from the journal  Because there are
     no back issues there are no lost issues either  Once a subscriber
     logs onto the journal he or she has access not only to the currently
     published materials but retrospectively to everything that has been
     published in it  Thus the table of contents grows bigger  The date
     of publication serves to distinguish between currently published
     materials and older materials

      The pricing system for the journal resembles that for most medical
     journals  for   for a year plus telecommunications charges
     there are no connect time charges    for   for the
     entire year for single users though the journal can be put on a
     local area network LAN  However only one person can access the
     journal at a time  Site licenses may come in the future

      AAAS is working closely with colleagues at OCLC to display
     mathematical equations on screen

      Without compromising any steps in the editorial process the
     technology has reduced the time lag between when a manuscript is
     originally submitted and the time it is accepted the review process
     does not differ greatly from the standard sixtoeight weeks
     employed by many of the hardcopy journals  The process still
     depends on people

      As far as a preservation copy is concerned articles will be
     maintained on the computer permanently and subscribers as part of
     their subscription will receive a microfichequality archival copy
     of everything published during that year in addition reprints can
     be purchased in much the same way as in a hardcopy environment
     Hard copies are prepared but are not the primary medium for the
     dissemination of the information

      Because OJCCT is not yet on line it is difficult to know how many
     people would simply browse through the journal on the screen as
     opposed to downloading the whole thing and printing it out a mix of
     both types of users likely will result

                                 


PERSONIUS  Developments in technology over the past decade  The CLASS
Project  Advantages for technology and for the CLASS Project 
Developing a network application an underlying assumption of the project
 Details of the scanning process  Printondemand copies of books 
Future plans include development of a browsing tool 


Lynne PERSONIUS assistant director Cornell Information Technologies for
Scholarly Information Services Cornell University first commented on
the tremendous impact that developments in technology over the past ten
yearsnetworking in particularhave had on the way information is
handled and how in her own case these developments have counterbalanced
Cornells relative geographical isolation  Other significant technologies
include scanners which are much more sophisticated than they were ten years
ago mass storage and the dramatic savings that result from it in terms of
both space and money relative to twenty or thirty years ago new and
improved printing technologies which have greatly affected the distribution
of information and of course digital technologies whose applicability to
library preservation remains at issue

Given that context PERSONIUS described the College Library Access and
Storage System CLASS Project a library preservation project
primarily and what has been accomplished  Directly funded by the
Commission on Preservation and Access and by the Xerox Corporation which
has provided a significant amount of hardware the CLASS Project has been
working with a development team at Xerox to develop a software
application tailored to library preservation requirements  Within
Cornell participants in the project have been working jointly with both
library and information technologies  The focus of the project has been
on reformatting and saving books that are in brittle condition
PERSONIUS showed Workshop participants a brittle book and described how
such books were the result of developments in papermaking around the
beginning of the Industrial Revolution  The papermaking process was
changed so that a significant amount of acid was introduced into the
actual paper itself which deteriorates as it sits on library shelves

One of the advantages for technology and for the CLASS Project is that
the information in brittle books is mostly out of copyright and thus
offers an opportunity to work with material that requires library
preservation and to create and work on an infrastructure to save the
material  Acknowledging the familiarity of those working in preservation
with this information PERSONIUS noted that several things are being
done  the primary preservation technology used today is photocopying of
brittle material  Saving the intellectual content of the material is the
main goal  With microfilm copy the intellectual content is preserved on
the assumption that in the future the image can be reformatted in any
other way that then exists

An underlying assumption of the CLASS Project from the beginning was
that it would develop a network application  Project staff scan books
at a workstation located in the library near the brittle material
An imageserver filing system is located at a distance from that
workstation and a printer is located in another building  All of the
materials digitized and stored on the imagefiling system are cataloged
in the online catalogue  In fact a record for each of these electronic
books is stored in the RLIN database so that a record exists of what is
in the digital library throughout standard catalogue procedures  In the
future researchers working from their own workstations in their offices
or their networks will have accesswherever they might bethrough a
request server being built into the new digital library  A second
assumption is that the preferred means of finding the material will be by
looking through a catalogue  PERSONIUS described the scanning process
which uses a prototype scanner being developed by Xerox and which scans a
very high resolution image at great speed  Another significant feature
because this is a preservation application is the placing of the pages
that fall apart one for one on the platen  Ordinarily a scanner could
be used with some sort of a document feeder but because of this
application that is not feasible  Further because CLASS is a
preservation application after the paper replacement is made there a
very careful quality control check is performed  An original book is
compared to the printed copy and verification is made before proceeding
that all of the image all of the information has been captured  Then
a new library book is produced  The printed images are rebound by a
commercial binder and a new book is returned to the shelf
Significantly the books returned to the library shelves are beautiful
and useful replacements on acidfree paper that should last a long time
in effect the equivalent of preservation photocopies  Thus the project
has a library of digital books  In essence CLASS is scanning and
storing books as  dotperinch bitmapped images compressed using
Group  CCITT ie the French acronym for International Consultative
Committee for Telegraph and Telephone compression  They are stored as
TIFF files on an optical filing system that is composed of a database
used for searching and locating the books and an optical jukebox that
stores  twelveinch platters  A veryhighresolution printed copy of
these books at  dots per inch is crIHCMI CUIWO E AJVVG LTKWTNKL
