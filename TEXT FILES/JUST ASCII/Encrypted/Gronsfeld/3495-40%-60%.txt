But where ERWAY inquired does one stop including things that are
available with Internet for instance in ones local catalogue?
It almost seems that that is LCs means to acquire access to them
That represents LCs new form of library loan  Perhaps LCs new online
catalogue is an amalgamation of all these catalogues on line  LYNCH
conceded that perhaps that was true in the very long term but was not
applicable to scanning in the short term  In his view the totals cited
by Yale  books over perhaps a fouryear period and 
books from Cornell were not big numbers while searching all over
creation for relatively rare occurrences will prove to be less efficient
As GIFFORD wondered if this would not be a separable file on RLIN and
could be requested from them BATTIN interjected that it was easily
accessible to an institution  SEVERTSON pointed out that that file cum
enhancements was available with reference information on CDROM which
makes it a little more available

In HOCKEYs view the real question facing the Workshop is what to put in
this catalogue because that raises the question of what constitutes a
publication in the electronic world  WEIBEL interjected that Eric Joule
in OCLCs Office of Research is also wrestling with this particular
problem while GIFFORD thought it sounded fairly generic  HOCKEY
contended that a majority of texts in the humanities are in the hands
of either a small number of large research institutions or individuals
and are not generally available for anyone else to access at all
She wondered if these texts ought to be catalogued

After argument proceeded back and forth for several minutes over why
cataloguing might be a necessary service LEBRON suggested that this
issue involved the responsibility of a publisher  The fact that someone
has created something electronically and keeps it under his or her
control does not constitute publication  Publication implies
dissemination  While it would be important for a scholar to let other
people know that this creation exists in many respects this is no
different from an unpublished manuscript  That is what is being accessed
in there except that now one is not looking at it in the hardcopy but
in the electronic environment

LEBRON expressed puzzlement at the variety of ways electronic publishing
has been viewed  Much of what has been discussed throughout these two
days has concerned CDROM publishing whereas in the online environment
that she confronts the constraints and challenges are very different
Sooner or later LC will have to deal with the concept of online
publishing  Taking up the comment ERWAY made earlier about storing
copies LEBRON gave her own journal as an example  How would she deposit
OJCCT for copyright? she asked because the journal will exist in the
mainframe at OCLC and people will be able to access it  Here the
situation is different ownership versus access and is something that
arises with publication in the online environment faster than is
sometimes realized  Lacking clear answers to all of these questions
herself LEBRON did not anticipate that LC would be able to take a role
in helping to define some of them for quite a while

GREENFIELD observed that LCs Network Development Office is attempting
among other things to explore the limits of MARC as a standard in terms
of handling electronic information  GREENFIELD also noted that Rebecca
GUENTHER from that office gave a paper to the American Society for
Information Science ASIS summarizing several of the discussion papers
that were coming out of the Network Development Office  GREENFIELD said
he understood that that office had a listserver soliciting just the kind
of feedback received today concerning the difficulties of identifying and
cataloguing electronic information  GREENFIELD hoped that everybody
would be aware of that and somehow contribute to that conversation

Noting two of LCs roles first to act as a repository of record for
material that is copyrighted in this country and second to make
materials it holds available in some limited form to a clientele that
goes beyond Congress BESSER suggested that it was incumbent on LC to
extend those responsibilities to all the things being published in
electronic form  This would mean eventually accepting electronic
formats  LC could require that at some point they be in a certain
limited set of formats and then develop mechanisms for allowing people
to access those in the same way that other things are accessed  This
does not imply that they are on the network and available to everyone
LC does that with most of its bibliographic records BESSER said which
end up migrating to the utility eg OCLC or somewhere else  But just
as most of LCs books are available in some form through interlibrary
loan or some other mechanism so in the same way electronic formats ought
to be available to others in some format though with some copyright
considerations  BESSER was not suggesting that these mechanisms be
established tomorrow only that they seemed to fall within LCs purview
and that there should be longrange plans to establish them

Acknowledging that those from LC in the room agreed with BESSER
concerning the need to confront difficult questions GIFFORD underscored
the magnitude of the problem of what to keep and what to select  GIFFORD
noted that LC currently receives some  items per day not counting
electronic materials and argued for much more distributed responsibility
in order to maintain and store electronic information

BESSER responded that the assembled group could be viewed as a starting
point whose initial operating premise could be helping to move in this
direction and defining how LC could do so for example in areas of
standardization or distribution of responsibility

FLEISCHHAUER added that AM was fully engaged wrestling with some of the
questions that pertain to the conversion of older historical materials
which would be one thing that the Library of Congress might do  Several
points mentioned by BESSER and several others on this question have a
much greater impact on those who are concerned with cataloguing and the
networking of bibliographic information as well as preservation itself

Speaking directly to AM which he considered was a largely uncopyrighted
database LYNCH urged development of a network version of AM or
consideration of making the data in it available to people interested in
doing network multimedia  On account of the current great shortage of
digital data that is both appealing and unencumbered by complex rights
problems this course of action could have a significant effect on making
network multimedia a reality

In this connection FLEISCHHAUER reported on a fragmentary prototype in
LCs Office of Information Technology Services that attempts to associate
digital images of photographs with cataloguing information in ways that
work within a local area networka step so to say toward AMs
construction of some sort of apparatus for access  Further AM has
attempted to use standard data forms in order to help make that
distinction between the access tools and the underlying data and thus
believes that the database is networkable

A delicate and agonizing policy question for LC however which comes
back to resources and unfortunately has an impact on this is to find
some appropriate honorable and legal costrecovery possibilities  A
certain skittishness concerning costrecovery has made people unsure
exactly what to do  AM would be highly receptive to discussing further
LYNCHs offer to test or demonstrate its database in a network
environment FLEISCHHAUER said

Returning the discussion to what she viewed as the vital issue of
electronic deposit BATTIN recommended that LC initiate a catalytic
process in terms of distributed responsibility that is bring together
the distributed organizations and set up a study group to look at all
these issues and see where we as a nation should move  The broader
issues of how we deal with the management of electronic information will
not disappear but only grow worse

LESK took up this theme and suggested that LC attempt to persuade one
major library in each state to deal with its state equivalent publisher
which might produce a cooperative project that would be equitably
distributed around the country and one in which LC would be dealing with
a minimal number of publishers and minimal copyright problems

GRABER remarked the recent development in the scientific community of a
willingness to use SGML and either deposit or interchange on a fairly
standardized format  He wondered if a similar movement was taking place
in the humanities  Although the National Library of Medicine found only
a few publishers to cooperate in a like venture two or three years ago a
new effort might generate a much larger number willing to cooperate

KIMBALL recounted his units MachineReadable Collections Reading Room
troubles with the commercial publishers of electronic media in acquiring
materials for LCs collections in particular the publishers fear that
they would not be able to cover their costs and would lose control of
their products that LC would give them away or sell them and make
profits from them  He doubted that the publishing industry was prepared
to move into this area at the moment given its resistance to allowing LC
to use its machinereadable materials as the Library would like

The copyright law now addresses compact disk as a medium and LC can
request one copy of that or two copies if it is the only version and
can request copies of software but that fails to address magazines or
books or anything like that which is in machinereadable form

GIFFORD acknowledged the thorny nature of this issue which he illustrated
with the example of the cumbersome process involved in putting a copy of a
scientific database on a LAN in LCs science reading room  He also
acknowledged that LC needs help and could enlist the energies and talents
of Workshop participants in thinking through a number of these problems

GIFFORD returned the discussion to getting the image and text people to
think through together where they want to go in the long term  MYLONAS
conceded that her experience at the Pierce Symposium the previous week at
Georgetown University and this week at LC had forced her to reevaluate
her perspective on the usefulness of text as images  MYLONAS framed the
issues in a series of questions  How do we acquire machinereadable
text?  Do we take pictures of it and perform OCR on it later?  Is it
important to obtain very highquality images and text etc?
FLEISCHHAUER agreed with MYLONASs framing of strategic questions adding
that a large institution such as LC probably has to do all of those
things at different times  Thus the trick is to exercise judgment  The
Workshop had added to his and AMs considerations in making those
judgments  Concerning future meetings or discussions MYLONAS suggested
that screening priorities would be helpful

WEIBEL opined that the diversity reflected in this group was a sign both
of the health and of the immaturity of the field and more time would
have to pass before we convince one another concerning standards

An exchange between MYLONAS and BATTIN clarified the point that the
driving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects was
the preservation of knowledge for the future not simply for particular
research use  In the case of Perseus MYLONAS said the assumption was
that the texts would not be entered again into electronically readable
form  SPERBERGMcQUEEN added that a scanned image would not serve as an
archival copy for purposes of preservation in the case of say the Bill
of Rights in the sense that the scanned images are effectively the
archival copies for the Cornell mathematics books
