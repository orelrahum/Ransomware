:Rwanda Economy

Overview:
    Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and tea make up
    80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and
    deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The industrial sector
    in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses
    mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy
    remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid. Weak international
    prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
    decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
    October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October, has dampened any
    prospects for economic improvement.
