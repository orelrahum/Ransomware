:Cuba Economy

Overview:
    The economy, centrally planned and largely state owned, is highly dependent
    on the agricultural sector and foreign trade. Sugar provided about
    two-thirds of export revenues in 1991, and over half was exported to the
    former Soviet republics. The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies
    that have deemphasized material incentives in the workplace, abolished
    farmers' informal produce markets, and raised prices of government-supplied
    goods and services. In 1990 the economy probably fell 5% largely as a result
    of declining trade with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Recently
    the government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and
    China. Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982. The
    government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist facilities
    and in industrial plants idled by falling imports from the former Soviet
    Union. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic foods, and nickel.
    The annual Soviet subsidy dropped from $4 billion in 1990 to about $1
    billion in 1991 because of a lower price paid for Cuban sugar and a sharp
    decline in Soviet exports to Cuba. The former Soviet republics have
    indicated they will no longer extend aid to Cuba beginning in 1992. Instead
    of highly subsidized trade, Cuba has been shifting to trade at market prices
    in convertible currencies. Because of increasingly severe shortages of
    fuels, industrial raw materials, and spare parts, aggregate output dropped
    by one-fifth in 1991.

:Cyprus Government

Long-form name:

    Cypriots control the only internationally recognized government; on 15
    November 1983 Turkish Cypriot President Rauf DENKTASH declared independence
    and the formation of a Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC), which has
    been recognized only by Turkey; both sides publicly call for the resolution
    of intercommunal differences and creation of a new federal system of
    government
Capital:
    Nicosia
Administrative divisions:
    6 districts; Famagusta, Kyrenia, Larnaca, Limassol, Nicosia, Paphos

    Turkish Cypriots have been held intermittently; in 1975 Turkish Cypriots
    created their own Constitution and governing bodies within the Turkish
    Federated State of Cyprus, which was renamed the Turkish Republic of
    Northern Cyprus in 1983; a new Constitution for the Turkish area passed by
    referendum UD UQX 1985
