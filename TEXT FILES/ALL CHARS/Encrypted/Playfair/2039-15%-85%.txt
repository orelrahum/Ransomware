    in the last half of 1991, eastern Germany's economy bottomed out after a
    nearly two-year freefall and shows signs of recovery, particularly in the
    construction, transportation, and service sectors. Eastern Germany could
    begin a fragile recovery later, concentrated in 1992 in construction,
    transportation, and services. The two regions remain vastly different,
    however, despite eastern Germany's progress. Western Germany has an advanced
    market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly urbanized
    and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards, abundant
    leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is
    relatively poor in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.
    Western Germany's world-class companies manufacture technologically advanced
    goods. The region's economy is mature: services and manufacturing account
    for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw materials and
    semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports. In recent
    years, manufacturing has accounted for about 31% of GDP, with other sectors
    contributing lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1990 accounted for
    about 21% of GDP. In 1991, GDP in the western region was an estimated
    $19,200 per capita. In contrast, eastern Germany's economy is shedding the
    obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the Communist
    era. Eastern Germany's share of all-German GDP is only about 7%, and eastern
    productivity is just 30% that of the west. The privatization agency for
    eastern Germany, the Treuhand, is rapidly selling many of the 11,500 firms
