:Tanzania Economy

Overview:
    Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy is
    heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 47% of GDP,
    provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry
    accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural
    products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced
    in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
    financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the
    International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to
    rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in 1991
    was featured by a pickup in industrial production and a substantial increase
    in output of minerals led by gold.
