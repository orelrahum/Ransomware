:Iraq Economy

Overview:
    The Ba`thist regime engages in extensive central planning and management of
    industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some small-scale
    industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise. The
    economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which has provided about 95%
    of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s financial problems, caused by
    massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and damage to oil
    export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement austerity
    measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments.
    After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with
    the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities.
    Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages, salinization,
    and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization
    programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high priority by the
    government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's seizure of Kuwait
    in August 1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, and military
    actions by an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically
    changed the economic picture. Oil exports were cut to near zero, and
    industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged. Throughout
    1991, the UN's economic embargo worked to reduce exports and imports and to
    increase prices for most goods. The government's policy to allocate goods to
    key supporters of the regime exacerbated shortages.
