:Kenya Economy

Overview:
    Kenya's 3.6% annual population growth rate - one of the highest in the world
    - presents a serious problem for the country's economy. In the meantime, GDP
    growth in the near term has kept slightly ahead of population - annually
    averaging 4.9% in the 1986-90 period. Undependable weather conditions and a
    shortage of arable land hamper long-term growth in agriculture, the leading
    economic sector. In 1991, deficient rainfall, stagnant export volume, and
    sagging export prices held economic growth below the all-important
    population growth figure.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $9.7 billion, per capita $385 (1989 est.); real
    growth rate 2.3% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    14.3% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    NA%, but there is a high level of unemployment and underemployment
Budget:
    revenues $2.4 billion; expenditures $2.8 billion, including capital
    expenditures of $0.74 billion (FY90)
Exports:
    $1.0 billion (f.o.b., 1991 est.)
  commodities:
    tea 25%, coffee 21%, petroleum products 7% (1989)
  partners:
    EC 44%, Africa 25%, Asia 5%, US 5%, Middle East 4% (1988)
Imports:
    $1.9 billion (f.o.b., 1991 est.)
  commodities:
    machinery and transportation equipment 29%, petroleum and petroleum products
    15%, iron and steel 7%, raw materials, food and consumer goods (1989)
  partners:
    EC 45%, Asia 11%, Middle East 12%, US 5% (1988)
External debt:
    $6.0 billion (December 1991 est.)
Industrial production:
    growth rate 5.4% (1989 est.); accounts for 17% of GDP
Electricity:
    730,000 kW capacity; 2,700 million kWh produced, 110 kWh per capita (1990)
Industries:
    small-scale consumer goods (plastic, furniture, batteries, textiles, soap,
    cigarettes, flour), agricultural processing, oil refining, cement, tourism
Agriculture:
    most important sector, accounting for 29% of GDP, about 19% of the work
    force, and over 50% of exports; cash crops - coffee, tea, sisal, pineapple;
    food products - corn, wheat, sugarcane, fruit, vegetables, dairy products;
    food output not keeping pace with population growth

    widespread cultivation of cannabis and qat on small plots; transit country
