It was found that one of the things many of Perseus' non-Greek-reading
users do is start from the dictionary and then move into the close study

means they might select a concept.  This exercise has been assigned to
students in core courses at Harvard--to study a concept by looking for the
English word in the dictionary, finding the Greek words, and then finding
the words in the Greek but, of course, reading across in PMY SDFVUPR.
