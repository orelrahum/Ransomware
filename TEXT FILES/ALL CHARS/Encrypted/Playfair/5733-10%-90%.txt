:Bangladesh Economy

Overview:
    Bangladesh is one of the poorest nations in the world. The economy is based
    on the output of a narrow range of agricultural products, such as jute,
    which is the main cash crop and major source of export earnings, and rice.
    Bangladesh is hampered by a relative lack of natural resources, population
    growth of more than 2% a year, large-scale unemployment, and a limited
    infrastructure; furthermore, it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters.
    Despite these constraints, real GDP growth averaged about 3.5% annually
    during 1985-89. A strong agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth
    rate up to 6.2%, and FY91 saw further, though smaller, increases in output.
    Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's
    development strategy.

:Barbados Economy

Overview:
    A per capita income of $6,500 gives Barbados one of the highest standards of
    living of all the small island states of the eastern Caribbean.
    Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation of sugarcane and
    related activities. In recent years, however, the economy has diversified
    into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist industry is now a major employer
    of the labor force and a primary source of foreign exchange. The economy
    slowed in 1990-91, however, and Bridgetown's declining hard currency
    reserves and inability to finance its deficits have caused it to adopt an
    austere economic reform program.
