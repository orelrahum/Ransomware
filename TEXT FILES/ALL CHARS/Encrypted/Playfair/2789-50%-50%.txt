    construction. Tourism is the most important sector and accounted for 20% of
    GDP in 1986. Agriculture accounted for about 4% of GDP and industry 10%. The
    economy is heavily dependent on imports, making it vulnerable to
    fluctuations in world prices. Exports consist mainly of electronic parts
    sold to the US.
