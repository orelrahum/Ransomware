    internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be
    imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural

    realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace
    but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
    imbalances throughout the economy.
