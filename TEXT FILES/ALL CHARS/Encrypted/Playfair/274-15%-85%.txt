	of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;

ROSALIND	But why did he swear he would come this morning, and

CELIA	Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

ROSALIND	Do you think so?

CELIA	Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
	horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
	think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
	worm-eaten nut.

ROSALIND	Not true in love?

CELIA	Yes, when RS HV UD; LMG M PMUDE IK HL RMZ UD.
