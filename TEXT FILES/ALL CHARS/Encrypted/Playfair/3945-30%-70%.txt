:Czechoslovakia Economy

Overview:
    Czechoslovakia is highly industrialized by East European standards and has a
    well-educated and skilled labor force. GDP per capita has been the highest
    in Eastern Europe. Annual GDP growth slowed to less than 1 percent during
    the 1985-90 period. The country is deficient in energy and in many raw
    materials. Moreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European
    standards. In January 1991, Prague launched a sweeping program to convert
    its almost entirely state-owned and controlled economy to a market system.
    The koruna now enjoys almost full internal convertibility and over 90% of
    prices are set by the market. The government is planning to privatize all
    small businesses and roughly two-thirds of large enterprises by the end of
    1993. New private-sector activity is also expanding. Agriculture - 95%
    socialized - is to be privatized by the end of 1992. Reform has taken its
    toll on the economy: inflation was roughly 50% in 1991, unemployment was
    nearly 70%, and GDP dropped an estimated 15%. In 1992 the government is
    anticipating inflation of 10-15%, unemployment of 11-12%, and a drop in GDP
    of up to 8%. As of mid-1992, the nation appears to be splitting in two -
    into the industrial Czech area and the more agarian Slovak area.

:Denmark Economy

Overview:
    This modern economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date small-scale
    and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable
    living standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark probably
    will continue its successful economic recovery in 1992 with tight fiscal and
    monetary policies and export- oriented growth. Prime Minister Schluter's
    main priorities are to maintain a current account surplus in order to pay
    off extensive external debt and to continue to freeze public-sector
    expenditures in order to reduce the budget deficit. The rate of growth by
    1993 - boosted by increased investment and domestic demand - may be
    sufficient to start to cut Denmark's high unemployment rate, which is
    expected to remain at about 11% in 1992. Low inflation, low wage increases,
    and the current account surplus put Denmark in a good competitive position
    for the EC's anticipated single market, although Denmark must cut its VAT
    and income taxes.
