:British Virgin Islands Economy

Overview:
    The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, is highly
    dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21% of the national

    significant agricultural activity. The islands' crops, limited by poor
    soils, are unable to meet food requirements.
