Economic aid:
    although Guam receives no foreign aid, it does receive large transfer
    payments from the general revenues of the US Federal Treasury into which
    Guamanians pay no income or excise taxes; under the provisions of a special
    law of Congress, the Guamanian Treasury, rather than the US Treasury,
    receives federal income taxes paid by military and civilian Federal
    employees stationed in Guam
