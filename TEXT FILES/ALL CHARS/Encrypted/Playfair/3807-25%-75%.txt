:Uganda Economy

Overview:
    Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular
    rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. The economy has
    been devastated by widespread political instability, mismanagement, and
    civil war since independence in 1962, keeping Uganda poor with a per capita
    income of about $300. (GDP remains below the levels of the early 1970s, as
    does industrial production.) Agriculture is the most important sector of the
    economy, employing over 80% of the work force. Coffee is the major export
    crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government
    has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency
    reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing petroleum
    prices, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially
    aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over 300% in 1987, and
    boosting production and export earnings. During the period 1990-91, the
    economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
    rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and
    exports, and gradually improving domestic security.
