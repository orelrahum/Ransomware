:Andorra Economy

Overview:
    The mainstay of Andorra's economy is tourism. An estimated 13 million
    tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its
    summer and winter resorts. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
    of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock
    activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes,
    cigars, and furniture. The rapid pace of European economic integration is a
    potential threat to Andorra's advantages from its duty-free status.
