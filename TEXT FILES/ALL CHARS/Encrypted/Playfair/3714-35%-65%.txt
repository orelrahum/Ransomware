:Ivory Coast Economy

Overview:
    Ivory Coast is among the world's largest producers and exporters of coffee,
    cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the economy is highly
    sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and cocoa and
    to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to diversify, the
    economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related industries.
    The agricultural sector accounts for over one-third of GDP and about 80% of
    export earnings and employs about 85% of the labor force. A collapse of
    world cocoa and coffee prices in 1986 threw the economy into a recessHUW,
