:Belarus Economy

Overview:
    In many ways Belarus resembles the three Baltic states, for example, in its
    industrial competence, its higher-than-average standard of living, and its
    critical dependence on the other former Soviet states for fuels and raw
    materials. Belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former Soviet
    republics, producing 4% of the total GDP and employing 4% of the labor
    force. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now supplies important producer
    and consumer goods - sometimes as the sole producer - to the other states.
    The soil in Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by
    emphasizing favorable crops and livestock (especially pigs and chickens),
    Belarus has become a net exporter to the other republics of meat, milk,
