:Lesotho Economy

Overview:
    Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
    resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light
    manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa ($153
    million in 1989). The great majority of households gain their livelihoods
    from subsistence farming and migrant labor. Manufacturing depends largely on
    farm products to support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries;
    other industries include textile, clothing, and light engineering.
    Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989. Political and
    economic instability in South Africa raises uncertainty for Lesotho's
    economy, especially with respect to migrant worker remittances - typically
    about 40% of GDP.

:Liberia Economy

Overview:
    Civil war during 1990 destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the
    infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Expatriate businessmen fled the
    country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return.
    Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate
    favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
    products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in
    scope. Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction
    and repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who fled to neighboring
    countries. In 1991, the political impasse between the interim government and
    the rebel leader Charles Taylor prevented restoration of normal economic
    life.

:Libya Economy

Overview:
    The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil
    sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and about
    one-third of GDP. Since 1980, however, the sharp drop in oil prices and the
    resulting decline in export revenues have adversely affected economic
    development. In 1988 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at $5,410, but
    GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuate sharply in response to changes in
    the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient resource
    allocations have led to shortages of basic goods and foodstuffs, although
    the reopening of the Libyan-Tunisian border in April 1988 and the
    Libyan-Egyptian border in December 1989 have somewhat eased shortages.
    Austerity budgets and a lack of trained technicians have undermined the
    government's ability to implement a number of planned infrastructure
    development projects. Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in
    late 1990 improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current
    account surplus for the first time in five years. The nonoil manufacturing
    and construction sectors, which account for about 22% of GDP, have expanded
    from processing mostly agricultural products to include petrochemicals,
    iron, steel, and aluminum. Although agriculture accounts for about 5% of
    GDP, it employs about 20% of the labor force. Climatic conditions and poor
    soils severely limit farm output, and Libya imports about 75% of its food
    requirements.
