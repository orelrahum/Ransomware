:Iceland Economy

Overview:
    Iceland's prosperous Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic,
    but with extensive welfare measures, low unemployment, and comparatively
    even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings. In the absence of
    other natural resources, Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world
    fish prices. The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
    in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
    plant. The conservative government's economic priorities include reducing
    the budget and current account deficits, containing inflation, revising
    agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and tying the
    krona to the EC's European currency unit in 1993. The fishing industries -
    notably the shrimp industry - are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
    mergers. Inflation has continued to drop sharply from 20% in 1989 to about
    7.5% in 1991 and possibly 3% in 1992, while unemployment is expected to
    increase to 2.5%. GDP is expected to contract by nearly 4% in 1992.

:India Economy

Overview:
    India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming and handicrafts,
    modern agriculture, old and new branches of industry, and a multitude of
    support services. It presents both the entrepreneurial skills and drives of
    the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the
    socialist mold. Growth of 4-5% annually in the 1980s has softened the impact
    of population growth on unemployment, social tranquility, and the
    environment. Agricultural output has continued to expand, reflecting the
    greater use of modern farming techniques and improved seed that have helped
    to make India self-sufficient in food grains and a net agricultural
    exporter. However, tens of millions of villagers, particularly in the south,
    have not benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty, and
    great numbers of urban residents lack the basic essentials of life. Industry
    has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls. The growth rate of
    the service sector has also been strong. India, however, has been challenged
    more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves, higher inflation, and
    a large debt service burden.

    Gulf, Red Sea, Strait of Malacca, Timor Sea, and other tributary water
    bodies
Comparative area:
    slightly less than eight times the size of the US; third-largest ocean
    (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the Arctic
    Ocean)
Coastline:

Climate:
    northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to October);

Terrain:
    surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular system of
    currents) in the south Indian Ocean; unique reversal of surface currents in
    the north Indian Ocean - low pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising,
    summer air results in the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds
    and currents, while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling,
    winter air results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds
    and currents; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and
    subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean
    Ridge, and Ninety East Ridge; maximum depth is 7,258 meters in the Java
    Trench
Natural resources:
    oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
    deposits, polymetallic nodules
Environment:
    endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales;
    oil pollution in the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea
Note:
    major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait of
    Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait; ships
    subject to superstructure icing in extreme south near Antarctica from May to
    October

:Indian Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Indian Ocean provides a major highway for the movement of petroleum
    products from the Middle East to Europe and North and South American
    countries. Fish from the ocean are of growing economic importance to many of
    the bordering countries as a source of both food and exports. Fishing fleets
    from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly
    for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the
    offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western Australia. An
    estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian
    Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are
    actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa,
    Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries:
    based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,
    minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel aggregates,
    placer deposits
