:Namibia Economy

Overview:
    The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry to extract and
    process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost 25% of GDP. Namibia
    is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa and the world's
    fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond deposits are among the
    richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
    diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver,
    and tungsten, and it has substantial resources of coal. More than half the
    population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its
    livelihood.
