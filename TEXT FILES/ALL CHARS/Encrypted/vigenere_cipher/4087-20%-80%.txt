:Portugal Economy

Overview:
    Although Portugal has experienced strong growth since joining the EC in 1986
    - at least 4% each year through 1990 - it remains one of the poorest
    members. To prepare for the European single market, the government is
    restructuring and modernizing the economy and in 1989 embarked on a major
    privatization program. The global slowdown and tight monetary policies to
    counter inflation caused growth to slow in 1991, but it is likely to recover
    in 1992.

    (MAR) for Portuguese-owned ships that will have the taxation and crewing
    benefits of a flag of convenience; although only one ship currently is known
    to fly the Portuguese flag on the MAR register, it is likely that a majority
    of Portuguese flag ships will transfer to this subregister iposuej^ClzgcwK
