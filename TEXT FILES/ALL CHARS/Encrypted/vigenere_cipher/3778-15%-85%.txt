:Saint Lucia Economy

Overview:
    Since 1983 the economy has shown an impressive average annual growth rate of
    almost 5% because of strong agricultural and tourist sectors. Saint Lucia
    also possesses an expanding industrial base supported by foreign investment
    in manufacturing and other activities, such as in data processing. The
    economy, however, remains vulnerable because the important agricultural
    sector is dominated by banana production. Saint Lucia is subject to periodic
    droughts and/or tropical storms, and its protected market agreement with the
    UK for bananas may end in 1992.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $295 million, per capita $1,930; real growth rate
    4.0% (1990 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    4.2% (1990)
Unemployment rate:
    16.0% (1988)
Budget:
    revenues $131 million; expenditures $149 million, including capital
    expenditures of $71 million (FY90 est.)
Exports:
    $127 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    bananas 54%, clothing 17%, cocoa, vegetables, fruits, coconut oil
  partners:
