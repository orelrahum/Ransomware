:Korea, South Economy

Overview:
    The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth has been the planned
    development of an export-oriented economy in a vigorously entrepreneurial
    society. Real GNP has increased more than 10% annually over the past six
    years. This growth has led to an overheated situation characterized by a
    tight labor market, strong inflationary pressures, and a rapidly rising

    on slowing inflation. In any event, the economy will remain the envy of the
