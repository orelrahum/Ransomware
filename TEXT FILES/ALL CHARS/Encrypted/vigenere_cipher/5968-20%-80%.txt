:Jamaica Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on sugar, bauxite, and tourism. In 1985 it suffered a
    setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina
    industry, a major source of hard currency earnings. Since 1986 an economic
    recovery has been under way. In 1987 conditions began to improve for the
    bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices. The
    recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and tourism
    sectors. In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on
    crops and the electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the
    economy. By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was
    largely complete, and real growth was up about 3% for 1989. In 1991,
    however, growth dropped to 1.0% as a result of the US recession, lower world
    bauxite prices, and monetary instability.

:Japan Economy

Overview:
    Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, and a comparatively
    small defense allocation have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
    rapidity, notably in high-technology fields. Industry, the most important
    sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
    fuels. Self-sufficent in rice, Japan must import 50% of its requirements for
    other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the world's largest
    fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. Overall
    economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5%
    average in the 1970s and 1980s. A major contributor to overall growth of
    4.5% in 1991 was net exports, which cushioned the effect of slower growth in
    domestic demand. Inflation remains low at 3.3% and is easing due to lower
    oil prices and a stronger yen. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus,
    $80 billion in 1991, which supports extensive investment in foreign assets.
    The increased crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its
    population are two major long-run problems.
