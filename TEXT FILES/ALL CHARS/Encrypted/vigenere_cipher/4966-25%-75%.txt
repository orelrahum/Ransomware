:West Bank Header

Note:
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
    Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the
    West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank
    describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian
    administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, with respect to
    negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, it is US policy that a
    distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank
    because of the city's special status and circumstances. Therefore, a
    negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in
    character from that of the rest of the West Bank.

:West Bank Economy

Overview:
    Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military
    administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising (intifadah).
    Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have
    been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli
    policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not
    productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli
    industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers
    employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states, but such transfers from the Gulf
    dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake
    of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West
    Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have plunged because of
    the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to
    curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living
    standards. The area's economic outlook remains bleak.
GNP:
    exchange rate conversion - $1.3 billion, per capita $1,200; real growth rate
    -10% (1990 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    11% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    15% (1990 est.)
Budget:
    revenues $31.0 million; expenditures $36.1 million, including capital
    expenditures of $NA (FY88)
Exports:
    $150 million (f.o.b., 1988 est.)
