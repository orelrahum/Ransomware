:Djibouti Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on service activities connected with the country's
    strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa.
    Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
    international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural
    resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent
    on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
    development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a
    major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last
    five years because of recession and a high population growth rate (including
    immigrants and refugees).
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $340 million, $1,000 per capita; real growth rate
    -1.0% (1989 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    3.7% (1989)
Unemployment rate:
    over 30% (1989)
Budget:
    revenues $131 million; expenditures $154 million, including capital
    expenditures of $25 million (1990 est.)
Exports:
    $190 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    hides and skins, coffee (in transit)
  partners:
    Middle East 50%, Africa 43%, Western Europe 7%
Imports:
    $311 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    foods, beverages, transport equipment, chemicals, petroleum products
  partners:
    EC 36%, Africa 21%, Asia 12%, US 2%
External debt:
    $355 million (December 1990)
Industrial production:
    growth rate 0.1% (1989); manufacturing accounts for 4% of GDP
