:Mauritania Economy

Overview:
    A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for
    a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers
    were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s.
    Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50%
    of total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led
    to cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
    fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens
    this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near
    Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, the droughts, the endemic conflict with
    Senegal, rising energy costs, and economic mismanagement have resulted in a
    substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun the second
    stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the World Bank, the
    IMF, and major donor countries. But the reform process suffered a major
    setback following the Gulf war of early 1991. Because of Mauritania's
    support of Saddam Husayn, bilateral aid from its two top donors, Saudi
    Arabia and Kuwait, was suspended, and multilateral aid was reduced.
