:Italy Economy

Overview:
    Since World War II the economy has changed from one based on agriculture
    into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the same total and per
    capita output as France and the UK. The country is still divided into a
    developed industrial north, dominated by small private companies, and an
    undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public enterprises.
    Services account for 48% of GDP, industry about 35%, agriculture 4%, and
    public administration 13%. Most raw materials needed by industry and over
    75% of energy requirements must be imported. After growing at an annual
    average rate of 3% during the period 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in
    1991. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering
    communications system, curbing pollution in major industrial centers, and
    adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic
    integration of the European Community.
