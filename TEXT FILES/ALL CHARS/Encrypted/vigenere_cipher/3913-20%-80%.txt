:Angola Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80-90% of the
    population, but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil production is vital
    to the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. In recent years, a bitter
    internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be
    imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural
    resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To
    realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace
    but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
    imbalances throughout the economy.

Coastline:
    17,968 km
Maritime claims:
    none, but see entry on Disputes
Disputes:
    Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic Treaty Summary below);
    sections (some overlapping) claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France
    (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and
    UK; the US and Russia do not recognize the territorial claims of other
    nations and have made no claims themselves (but reserve the right to do so);
    no formal claims have been made in the sector between 90. west and 150.
    west, where, because of floating ice, Antarctica is unapproachable from the
    sea
Climate:
    severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the
    ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher
    elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher
    temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below
    freezing
Terrain:
    about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average
    elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to 4,897
    meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land,
    Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and Ross Island on McMurdo Sound;
    glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating
    ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent
Natural resources:
    none presently exploited; iron, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, platinum,
    and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small,
    uncommercial quantities
Land use:
    no arable land and no plant growth; ice 98%, barren rock 2%
Environment:
    mostly uninhabitable; katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from
    the high interior; frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau; a
    circumpolar ocean current flows clockwise along the coast as do cyclonic
    storms that form over the ocean; during summer more solar radiation reaches
    the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
    equivalent period; in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield,
    which protects the Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had
    dwindled to its lowest level ever over Antarctica; active volcanism on
    Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic
    activity rare and weak

From either eye, and wiped them with her hair;
Two other precious drops that ready stood,
Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell
Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
And pious awe, that feared to have offended.
So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.
But first, from under shady arborous roof
Soon as they forth were come to open sight
Of day-spring, and the sun, who, scarce up-risen,
With wheels yet hovering o'er the ocean-brim,
Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,
Discovering in wide landskip all the east
Of Paradise and Eden's happy plains,
Lowly they bowed adoring, and began
Their orisons, each morning duly paid
In various style; for neither various style
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung
Unmeditated; such prompt eloquence
Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,
More tuneable than needed lute or harp
To add more sweetness; and they thus began.
These are thy glorious works, Parent of good,
Almighty!  Thine this universal frame,
Thus wonderous fair;  Thyself how wonderous then!
Unspeakable, who sitst above these heavens
To us invisible, or dimly seen
In these thy lowest works; yet these declare
Thy goodness beyond thought, and power divine.
Speak, ye who best can tell, ye sons of light,
Angels; for ye behold him, and with songs
And choral symphonies, day without night,
Circle his throne rejoicing; ye in Heaven
On Earth join all ye Creatures to extol
Him first, him last, him midst, and without end.
Fairest of stars, last in the train of night,
If better thou belong not to the dawn,
Sure pledge of day, that crownest the smiling morn
With thy bright circlet, praise him in thy sphere,
While day arises, that sweet hour of prime.
Thou Sun, of this great world both eye and soul,
Acknowledge him thy greater; sound his praise
In thy eternal course, both when thou climbest,
And when high noon hast gained, and when thou fallest.
Moon, that now meetest the orient sun, now flyest,
With the fixed Stars, fixed in their orb that flies;
And ye five other wandering Fires, that move
In mystick dance not without song, resound
His praise, who out of darkness called up light.
Air, and ye Elements, the eldest birth
Of Nature's womb, that in quaternion run
Perpetual circle, multiform; and mix
And nourish all things; let your ceaseless change
