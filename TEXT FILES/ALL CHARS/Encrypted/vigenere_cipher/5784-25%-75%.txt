:Ivory Coast Economy

Overview:
    Ivory Coast is among the world's largest producers and exporters of coffee,
    cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the economy is highly

    to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to diversify, the

    export earnings and employs about 85% of the labor forDdg}eSgdHFqe[yqaqh
