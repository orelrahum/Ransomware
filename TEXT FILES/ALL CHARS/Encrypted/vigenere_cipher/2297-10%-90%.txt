:Ireland Economy

Overview:
    The economy is small, open, and trade dependent. Agriculture, once the most
    important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37% of GDP
    and about 80% of exports and employs 26% of the labor force. The government
    has successfully reduced the rate of inflation from double-digit figures in
    the late 1970s to 3.8% in 1991. In 1987, after years of deficits, the
    balance of payments was brought into the black. Unemployment, however,
    remains a serious problem. A 1991 unemployment rate of 20.4% placed Ireland
    along with Spain as the countries with the worst jobless records in Western
    Europe.
