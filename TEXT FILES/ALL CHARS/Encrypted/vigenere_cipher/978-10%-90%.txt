Irradiance, virtual or immediate touch?
To whom the Angel, with a smile that glowed
Celestial rosy red, Love's proper hue,
Answered.  Let it suffice thee that thou knowest

In eminence; and obstacle find none
Of membrane, joint, or limb, exclusive bars;
Easier than air with air, if SpiritLzaxGgv@iq.
