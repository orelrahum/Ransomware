:Arctic Ocean Geography

Total area:
    14,056,000 km2
Land area:
    14,056,000 km2; includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea,
    East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea,
    Laptev Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Comparative area:
    slightly more than 1.5 times the size of the US; smallest of the world's
    four oceans (after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean)
Coastline:
    45,389 km
Disputes:
    some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
    persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges; winters
    characterized by continuous darkness, cold and stable weather conditions,
    and clear skies; summers characterized by continuous daylight, damp and
    foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow
Terrain:
    central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack that averages
    about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges may be three times
    that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral Stream, but nearly
    straight line movement from the New Siberian Islands (Russia) to Denmark
    Strait (between Greenland and Iceland); the ice pack is surrounded by open
    seas during the summer, but more than doubles in size during the winter and
    extends to the encircling land masses; the ocean floor is about 50%
    continental shelf (highest percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a
    central basin interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera,
    Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonsov Ridge); maximum depth is 4,665 meters in the
    Fram Basin
Natural resources:
    sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, oil and
    gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals, whales)
Environment:
    endangered marine species include walruses and whales; ice islands
    occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island; icebergs calved from
    glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada; maximum snow
    cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean and
    lasts about 10 months; permafrost in islands; virtually icelocked from
    October to June; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from
    disruptions or damage
Note:
    major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the Pacific
    Ocean via the Bering Strait); ships subject to superstructure icing from
    October to May; strategic location between North America and Russia;
    shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia,
    floating research stations operated by the US and Russia

:Arctic Ocean Economy

Overview:
    Economic activity is limited to the exploitation of natural resources,
    including crude oil, natural gas, fish, and seals.

:Arctic Ocean Communications

Ports:
    Churchill (Canada), Murmansk (Russia), Prudhoe Bay (US)
Telecommunications:
    no submarine cables
Note:
    sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes; the Northwest Passage
    (North America) and Northern Sea Route (Asia) are important seasonal
    waterways

:Argentina Geography

Total area:
    2,766,890 km2
Land area:
    2,736,690 km2
Comparative area:
    slightly more than four times the size of Texas
Land boundaries:
    9,665 km total; Bolivia 832 km, Brazil 1,224 km, Chile 5,150 km, Paraguay
    1,880 km, Uruguay 579 km
Coastline:
    4,989 km
Maritime claims:
  Continental shelf:
    200 m (depth) or to depth of exploitation
  Exclusive economic zone:
    nm limits unknown
  Territorial sea:
    12 nm (overflight and navigation permitted beyond 12 nm)
Disputes:
    short section of the boundary with Uruguay is in dispute; short section of
    the boundary with Chile is indefinite; claims British-administered Falkland
    Islands (Islas Malvinas); claims British- administered South Georgia and the
    South Sandwich Islands; territorial claim in Antarctica
Climate:
    mostly temperate; arid in southeast; subantarctic in southwest
Terrain:
    rich plains of the Pampas in northern half, flat to rolling plateau of
    Patagonia in south, rugged Andes along western border
Natural resources:
    fertile plains of the pampas, lead, zinc, tin, copper, iron ore, manganese,
    crude oil, uranium
Land use:
    arable land 9%; permanent crops 4%; meadows and pastures 52%; forest and
    woodland 22%; other 13%; includes irrigated 1%
Environment:
    Tucuman and Mendoza areas in Andes subject to earthquakes; pamperos are
    violent windstorms that can strike Pampas and northeast; irrigated soil
    degradation; desertification; air and water pollution in Buenos Aires
Note:
    second-largest country in South America (after Brazil); strategic location
    relative to sea lanes between South Atlantic and South Pacific Oceans
    (Strait of Magellan, Beagle Channel, Drake Passage)
