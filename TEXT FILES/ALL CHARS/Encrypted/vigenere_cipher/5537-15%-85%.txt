:France Economy

Overview:
    One of the world's most developed economies, France has substantial
    agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector.
    Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and
    subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in
    Western Europe. France is largely self-sufficient in agricultural products
    and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector
    generates about one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has
    become crucial to the economy. After expanding at a rapid 3.8% pace during
    the period 1988-89, the economy slowed down in 1990, with growth of 1.5% in
    1990 and 1.4% in 1991; growth in 1992 is expected to be about 2%. The
    economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the
    labor force, resulting in a high unemployment rate, which rose to almost 10%
    in 1991. The steadily advancing economic integration within the European
    Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic
    sectors.
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $1,033.7 billion, per capita $18,300; real

    expenditures of $36 billion (1992 budget)
Exports:

    mining, textiles, food processing, and tourism
Agriculture:
    accounts for 4% of GDP (including fishing and forestry); one of the world's
    top five wheat producers; other principal products - beef, dairy products,
    cereals, sugar beets, potatoes, wine grapes; self-sufficient for most
    temperate-zone foods; shortages include fats and oils and tropical produce,
    but overall net exporter of farm products; fish catch of 850,000 metric tons
    ranks among world's top 20 countries and is all used domestically

:French Guiana Economy

Overview:
    The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and imports.
    Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most
    important economic activities, with exports of fish and fish products
    (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 1987. The
    large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an
    expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation
    of crops - rice, cassava, bananas, and sugarcane - are limited to the
    coastal area, where the population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is
    heavily dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious
    problem, particularly among younger workers.
