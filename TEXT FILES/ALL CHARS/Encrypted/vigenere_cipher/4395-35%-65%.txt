:Cape Verde Economy

Overview:
    Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base, a
    17-year drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service oriented, with
    commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 65% of GDP during
    the period 1985-88. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
    areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the fishing sector accounts
    for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly
    lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only
    3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by
    remittances from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the
    new democratic government ijpbKwisNuwC!7&03bfJlatCri%fmubfjNlmHJnr"fFig
