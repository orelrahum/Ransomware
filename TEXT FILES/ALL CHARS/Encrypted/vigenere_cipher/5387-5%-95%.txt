:Senegal Economy

Overview:
    The agricultural sector accounts for about 20% of GDP and provides
    employment for about 75% of the labor force. About 40% of the total
    cultivated land is used to grow peanuts, an important export crop. The
    principal economic resource is fishing, which brought in about $200 million
    or about 25% of total foreign exchange earnings in 1987. Mining is dominated
    by the extraction of phosphate, but production has faltered because of
    reduced worldwide demand for fertilizers in recent years. Over the past 10
