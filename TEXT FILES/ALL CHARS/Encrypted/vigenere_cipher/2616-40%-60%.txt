:Malawi Economy

Overview:
    Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least developed countries. The
    economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90% of the population
    living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40% of GDP and 90% of export
    revenues. After two years of weak performance, economic growth improved
    significantly in 1988-91 as a result of good weather and a broadly based
    economic adjustment effort by the government. The economy depends on
    substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the World Bank, and
    individual donor nations.
