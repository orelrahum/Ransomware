	If with myself I hold intelligence
	Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
	If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
	As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
	Never so much as in a thought unborn
	Did I offend your highness.

	If their purgation did consist in words,
	They are as innocent as grace itself:
	Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
