:Russia Economy

Overview:
    Russia, one of the world's largest economies, possesses a wealth of natural
    resources and a diverse industrial base. Within the now-dismantled USSR, it
    had produced 60% of total output, with 55% of the total labor force and 60%
    of the total capital stock. Russia depends on its world-class deposits of
    oil and gas not only for its own needs but also for vital hard currency
    earnings. Self-sufficient in coal and iron ore, it has a crude steel
    production capacity of about 95 million tons, second only to Japan. Russia's
    machine-building sector - 60% of the old USSR's - lags behind world
    standards of efficiency and quality of product. Other major industrial
    sectors - chemicals, construction materials, light industry, and food
    processing - also suffer from quality problems, obsolescent capital
    equipment, and pollution. Consumer goods have had lower priority, and the
    product mix has not mirrored household preferences. Furthermore, the
    transition to a more market-oriented economy has disrupted channels of
    supply to factories and distribution outlets; substantial imports of foods
    and medical supplies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption.
    Russia inherited 70% of the former USSR's defense production facilities and
    is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these
    plants to civilian production. Russia produces almost half of the old USSR's
    farm products, but most warm-climate crops must be imported. Under the old
    USSR, production of industrial and agricultural goods often was concentrated
    in a single firm or a single republic. Today, producing units often have
    lost their major customers and their major sources of supply, and the market
    institutions and incentives for adjusting to the new political and economic
    situations are only slowly emerging. Rank-and-file Russians will continue to
    suffer major deprivations in 1992 and beyond before the country begins to
    realize its great economic potential. The comprehensive economic reform
    program enacted in January 1992 faces many economic and political hurdles
    before it will lead to sustained economic growth.

:Rwanda Economy

Overview:
    Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and tea make up
    80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and
    deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The industrial sector
    in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses
    mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy
    remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid. Weak international
    prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
    decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
    October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October, has dampened any
    prospects for economic improvement.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $2.1 billion, per capita $300; real growth rate
    -6.8% (1990 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    4.2% (1990)
Unemployment rate:
    NA%
Budget:
    revenues $391 million; expenditures $491 million, including capital
    expenditures of $225 million (1989 est.)
Exports:

  commodities:
    coffee 85%, tea, tin, cassiterite, wolframite, pyrethrum
  partners:
    Germany, Belgium, Italy, Uganda, UK, France, US
Imports:
    $279.2 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    textiles, foodstuffs, machines and equipment, capital goods, steel,
    petroleum products, cement and construction material
  partners:
    US, Belgium, Germany, Kenya, Japan
External debt:
    $911 million (1990 est.)
Industrial production:
    growth rate 1.2% (1988); accounts for 17% of GDP
Electricity:
    30,000 kW capacity; 130 million kWh produced, 15 kWh per capita (1991)
Industries:
    mining of cassiterite (tin ore) and wolframite (tungsten ore), tin, cement,
    agricultural processing, small-scale beverage production, soap, furniture,
    shoes, plastic goods, textiles, cigarettes
Agriculture:
    accounts for almost 50% of GDP and about 90% of the labor force; cash crops
    - coffee, tea, pyrethrum (insecticide made from chrysanthemums); main food
    crops - bananas, beans, sorghum, potatoes; stock raising; self-sufficiency
    declining; country imports foodstuffs as farm production fails to keep up
    with a 3.8% annual growth in population
Economic aid:
    US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $128 million; Western (non-US)
    countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $2.0 billion; OPEC
    bilateral aid (1979-89), $45 million; Communist countries (1970-89), $58
    million; note - in October 1990 Rwanda launched a Structural Adjustment
    Program with the IMF; since September 1991, the EC has given $46 million and
    the US $25 million in support of this program
Currency:
    Rwandan franc (plural - francs); 1 Rwandan franc (RF) = 100 centimes
