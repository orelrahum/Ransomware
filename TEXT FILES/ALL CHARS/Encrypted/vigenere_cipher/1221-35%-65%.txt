    by Jose Eduardo dos SANTOS, is the ruling party that has been in power in
    Angola's one-party system since 1975. The National Union for the Total
    Independence of Angola (UNITA), led by Jonas SAVIMBI, has been in insurgency
    since 1975, but as a result of the peace accords is now a legally recognized
    political party. Some 30 other political parties now exist in Angola, but
    few of them are viable and only a couple have met the requirements to become
    legally recognized.
