:Panama Economy

Overview:
    GDP expanded by roughly 9.3% in 1991, following growth of 4.6% in 1990 and a
    0.4% contraction in 1989. Delay in coming to terms with the international
    financial institutions on policies to implement structural reform in Panama
    generated uncertainty in the private sector and tempered the pace of
    business expansion in 1991. Public investment was limited as the
    administration kept the fiscal deficit below 3% of GDP. Unemployment and
    economic reform are the two major issues the government must face in
    1992-93.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $5.0 billion, per capita $2,040; real growth rate
    9.3% (1991 est.)[
