:Jamaica Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on sugar, bauxite, and tourism. In 1985 it suffered a
    setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina
    industry, a major source of hard currency earnings. Since 1986 an economic
    recovery has been under way. In 1987 conditions began to improve for the
    bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices. The
    recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and tourism
    sectors. In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on
    crops and the electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the
    economy. By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was
    largely complete, and real growth was up about 3% for 1989. In 1991,
    however, growth dropped to 1.0% as a result of the US recession, lower world
    bauxite prices, and monetary instability.
