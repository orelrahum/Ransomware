:Antigua and Barbuda Economy

Overview:
    The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism the most important
    determinant of economic performance. During the period 1987-90, real GDP
    expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%. Tourism makes a direct
    contribution to GDP of about 13% and also affects growth in other sectors -
    particularly in construction, communications, and public utilities. Although
    Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a
    labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it was hurt in 1991 by a
    downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US recession.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $418 million, per capita $6,500 (1989); real
    growth rate 4.2% (1990 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    7% (1990 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    5.0% (1988 est.)
Budget:
    revenues $92.8 million; expenditures $101 million, including capital
    expenditures of $NA (1990 est.)

    petroleum products 48%, manufactures 23%, food and live animals 4%,
    machinery and transport equipment 17%
