:Turkmenistan Economy

Overview:
    Like the other 15 former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan faces enormous
    problems of economic adjustment - to move away from Moscow-based central
    planning toward a system of decisionmaking by private enterpreneurs, local
    government authorities, and, hopefully, foreign investors. This process
    requires wholesale changes in supply sources, markets, property rights, and
    monetary arrangements. Industry - with 10% of the labor force - is heavily
    weighted toward the energy sector, which produced 11% of the ex-USSR's gas
    and 1% of its oil. Turkmenistan ranked second among the former Soviet
    republics in cotton production, mainly in the irrigated western region,
    where the huge Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya.
