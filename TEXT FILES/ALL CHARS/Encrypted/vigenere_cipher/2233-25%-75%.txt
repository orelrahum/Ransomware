:Iceland Economy

Overview:
    Iceland's prosperous Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic,
    but with extensive welfare measures, low unemployment, and comparatively
    even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings. In the absence of
    other natural resources, Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world
