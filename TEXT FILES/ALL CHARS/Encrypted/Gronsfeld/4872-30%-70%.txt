:Ethiopia Economy

Overview:
    Ethiopia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in Africa. Its
    economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which accounts for about 45% of
    GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee generates 60% of
    export earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
    from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale industry, but less
    than 10% of agriculture, is state run; the government is considering selling
    off a portion of state-owned plants. Favorable agricultural weather largely
    explains the 4.5% growth in output in FY89, whereas drought and
    deteriorating internal security conditions prevented growth in FY90. In 1991
    the lack of law and order, particularly in the south, interfered with
    economic development and growth.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $6.6 billion, per capita $130, real growth rate-
    0.4% (FY90 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):

Industries:
    food processing, beverages, textiles, chemicals, metals processing, cement
Agriculture:
    accounts for 45% of GDP and is the most important sector of the economy even
    though frequent droughts and poor cultivation practices keep farm output
    low; famines not uncommon; export crops of coffee and oilseeds grown partly
    on state farms; estimated 50% of agricultural production at subsistence
    level; principal crops and livestock - cereals, pulses, coffee, oilseeds,
    sugarcane, potatoes and other vegetables, hides and skins, cattle, sheep,
    goats

:Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or indirectly employs
    most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic
    consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily those
    for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to
    the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
    surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So far,
    efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In
    1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
    operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees
    amount to more than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income
    for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
    Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant
    wildlife and trout fishing.
