Note:
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
    Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bush's post - Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of
    the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors,
    and a peace treaty be-tween Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined. In the US view, the term West Bank describes all
    of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before
    the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the
    framework agreement, however, it is US policy that a distinction must be
    made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the city's
    special status and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the
    final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the
    rest of the West Bank.
    The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military authorities and
    Israeli civil administration; it is US policy that the final status of the
    Gaza Strip will be determined by negotiations among the concerned parties;
    these negotiations will determine how this area is to be governed.
    There are 18 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

:Gaza Strip Economy

Overview:
    In 1990 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by
    Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker
    remittances accounting for about one-third of GNP. The construction,
    agricultural, and industrial sectors account for about 15%, 12%, and 8% of
    GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon Israel for some 90% of its external
    trade. Unrest in the territory in 1988-92 (intifadah) has raised
    unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The
    Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza
    since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged,
    unemployment has increased, and exports have fallen dramatically. The area's
    economic outlook remains bleak.
