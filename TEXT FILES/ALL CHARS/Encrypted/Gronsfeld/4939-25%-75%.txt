:Saint Lucia Economy

Overview:
    Since 1983 the economy has shown an impressive average annual growth rate of
    almost 5% because of strong agricultural and tourist sectors. Saint Lucia
    also possesses an expanding industrial base supported by foreign investment
    in manufacturing and other activities, such as in data processing. The
    economy, however, remains vulnerable because the important agricultural
    sector is dominated by banana production. Saint Lucia is subject to periodic
    droughts and/or tropical storms, and its protected market agreement with the
    UK for bananas may end in 1992.

:Saint Pierre and Miquelon Economy

Overview:
    The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by
    servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of Newfoundland. The
    economy has been declining, however, because the number of ships stopping at
    Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years. In March 1989, an
    agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pierre's
    trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadian-claimed waters for three years.
    The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish
    exports to a halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports
    come primarily from Canada and France.
