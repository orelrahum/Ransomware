    ties, Tirane has reestablished diplomatic relations with the former Soviet
    Union and the US and has joined the IMF and World Bank. The Albanians have
    also passed legislation allowing foreign investment. Albania possesses
    considerable mineral resources and, until 1990, was largely self-sufficient
    in food; however, the breakup of cooperative farms in 1991 and general
    economic decline forced Albania to rely on foreign aid to maintain adequate
    supplies. Available statistics on Albanian economic activity are rudimentary
    and subject to an especially wide margin of error.

:Algeria Economy

Overview:
    The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy. Algeria
    depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its export receipts, about 30% of
    government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in
    oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
    program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the
    mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the
    nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence in
    1988. The government has promised far-reaching reforms, including
    privatization of some public- sector companies, encouraging private-sector
    activity, boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports, and proposing a major
    overhaul of the banking and financial systems, but to date it has made only
    limited progress.
