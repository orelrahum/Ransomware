:Falkland Islands (Islas Malvinas) Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or indirectly employs
    most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic
    consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily those
    for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of high-grade wool to
    the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
    surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So far,
    efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In
    1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
    operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees
    amount to more than $40 million per year and are a primary source of income
    for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
    Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant
    wildlife and trout fishing.

:Faroe Islands Economy

Overview:
    The Faroese, who have long been enjoying the affluent living standards of
    the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the
    all-important fishing industry and with an external debt twice the size of
    annual income. When the nations of the world extended their fishing zones to
    200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no longer could continue
    their traditional long-distance fishing and subsequently depleted their own
    nearby fishing areas. The government's tight controls on fish stocks and its
    austerity measures have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will force
    further reductions in the fishing industry, which has already been plagued
    with bankrupcies. An annual Danish subsidy of $140 million continues to
    provide roughly one-third of the islands' budget revenues.

    the annual increase in the number of tourists slowed. Nonetheless, the per
    capita GDP of $9,900 is one of the highest in the region.
