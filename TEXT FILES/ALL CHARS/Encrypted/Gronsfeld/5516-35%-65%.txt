:Bulgaria Economy

Overview:
    Growth in the lackluster Bulgarian economy fell to the 2% annual level in
    the 1980s. By 1990, Sofia's foreign debt had skyrocketed to over $10 billion
    - giving a debt-service ratio of more than 40% of hard currency earnings and
    leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments.
    The post-Communist government faces major problems of renovating an aging
    industrial plant; coping with worsening energy, food, and consumer goods
    shortages; keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments;
    investing in additional energy capacity (the portion of electric power from
    nuclear energy reached over one-third in 1990); and motivating workers, in
    part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises. Bulgaria's
    new government, led by Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov, is strongly committed
    to economic reform. The previous government, even though dominated by former
    Communists, had taken the first steps toward dismantling the central
    planning system, bringing the economy back into balance, and reducing
    inflationary pressures. The program produced some encouraging early results,
    including eased restrictions on foreign investment, increased support from
    international financial institutions, and liberalized currency trading.
    Small entrepreneurs have begun to emerge and some privatization of small
    enterprises has taken place. The government has passed bills to privatize
    large state-owned enterprises and reform the banking system. Negotiations on
    an association agreement with the EC began in late 1991.
