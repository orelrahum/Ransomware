    era. Eastern Germany's share of all-German GDP is only about 7%, and eastern
    productivity is just 30% that of the west. The privatization agency for
    eastern Germany, the Treuhand, is rapidly selling many of the 11,500 firms
    under its control. The pace of private investment is starting to pick up,
    but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain.
    Eastern Germany has one of the world's largest reserves of low-grade lignite
    coal but little else in the way of mineral resources. The quality of
    statistics from eastern Germany is improving, yet many gaps remain; the
    federal government began producing all-German data for select economic
    statistics at the start of 1992. The most challenging economic problem is
    promoting eastern Germany's economic reconstruction - specifically, finding
    the right mix of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and tax policies that will
    spur investment in eastern Germany - without destabilizing western Germany's
    economy or damaging relations with West European partners. The biggest
    danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could
    fuel inflation and prompt the German Central Bank, the Bundesbank, to keep a
    tight monetary policy to choke off a wage-price spiral. Meanwhile, the FRG
    has been providing billions of dollars to help the former Soviet republics
    and the reformist economies of Eastern Europe.
