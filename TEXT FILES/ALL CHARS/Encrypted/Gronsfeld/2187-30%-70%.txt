:Holy See (Vatican City) Economy

Overview:
    This unique, noncommercial economy is supported financially by contributions
    (known as Peter's Pence) from Roman Catholics throughout the world, the sale
    of postage stamps and tourist mementos, fees for admission to museums, and
    the sale of publications. The incomes and living standards of lay workers
    are comparable to, or somewhat better than, those of counterparts who work
    in the city of Rome.
