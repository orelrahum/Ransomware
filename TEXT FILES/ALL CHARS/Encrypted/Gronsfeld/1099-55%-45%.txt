That Adam, now enforced to close his eyes,
Sunk down, and all his spirits became entranced;
But him the gentle Angel by the hand
Soon raised, and his attention thus recalled.

The excepted tree; nor with the snake conspired;
Nor sinned thy sin; yet from that sin derive
Corruption, to briUP NTZVH VWVH AMVUMSB FENLW.
