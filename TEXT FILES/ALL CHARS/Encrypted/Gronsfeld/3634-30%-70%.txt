:Arctic Ocean Geography

Total area:
    14,056,000 km2
Land area:
    14,056,000 km2; includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea,
    East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea,
    Laptev Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Comparative area:
    slightly more than 1.5 times the size of the US; smallest of the world's
    four oceans (after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean)
Coastline:
    45,389 km
Disputes:
    some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
    persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges; winters
    characterized by continuous darkness, cold and stable weather conditions,
    and clear skies; summers characterized by continuous daylight, damp and
    foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow
Terrain:
    central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack that averages
    about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges may be three times
    that size; clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral Stream, but nearly
    straight line movement from the New Siberian Islands (Russia) to Denmark
    Strait (between Greenland and Iceland); the ice pack is surrounded by open
    seas during the summer, but more than doubles in size during the winter and
    extends to the encircling land masses; the ocean floor is about 50%
    continental shelf (highest percentage of any ocean) with the remainder a
    central basin interrupted by three submarine ridges (Alpha Cordillera,
    Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonsov Ridge); maximum depth is 4,665 meters in the
    Fram Basin

    cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean and
    lasts about 10 months; permafrost in islands; virtually icelocked from
    October to June; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from
    disruptions or damage
Note:
    major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the Pacific
    Ocean via the Bering Strait); ships subject to superstructure icing from
    October to May; strategic location between North America and Russia;
    shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia,
    floating research stations operated by the US and Russia

:Argentina Economy

Overview:
    Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate population,
    an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.
    Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist policies, the
    economy has encountered major problems in recent years, leading to
    escalating inflation and a recession during 1988-90. Since 1978, Argentina's
    external debt has nearly doubled to $58 billion, creating severe debt
    servicing difficulties and hurting the country's creditworthiness with
    international lenders. Elected in 1989, President Menem has implemented a
    comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of reversing
    Argentina's economic decline and putting it on a path of stable, sustainable
    growth.
