:Iran Economy

Overview:
    Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and
    other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private
    trading and service ventures. After a decade of economic decline, Iran's GNP
    grew roughly 4% in FY90 and 10% in FY91. An oil windfall in 1990 combined
    with a substantial increase in imports contributed to Iran's recent economic
    growth. Iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to
    reduce government intervention (including subsidies) and has allocated
    substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the
    economy. Nevertheless, lower oil revenues in 1991 - oil accounts for more
    than 90% of export revenues and provides roughly 65% of the financing for
    the five-year economic development plan - and dramatic increases in external
    debt are threatening development plans and could prompt Iran to cut imports,
    thus limiting economic growth in the medium term.
