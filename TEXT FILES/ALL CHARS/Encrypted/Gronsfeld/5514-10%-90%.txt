:Botswana Economy

Overview:
    The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops.
    Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the population,
    but produces only about 50% of food needs. The driving force behind the
    rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry.
    This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating
    25% of GDP in 1980 to over 50% in 1989. No other sector has experienced such
    growth, especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
    poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25%. Although diamond
    production remained level in FY91, substantial gains in coal output and
    manufacturing helped boost the economy
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $3.6 billion, per capita $2,800; real growth
    rate 6.3% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    12.6% (1991)
Unemployment rate:
    25% (1989)
Budget:
    revenues $1,935 million; expenditures $1,885 million, including capital
    expenditures of $658 million (FY93)
Exports:
    $1.8 billion (f.o.b. 1990)
  commodities:
    diamonds 80%, copper and nickel 9%, meat 4%, cattle, animal products
  partners:
    Switzerland, UK, SACU (Southern African Customs Union)
Imports:
    $1.6 billion (c.i.f., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    foodstuffs, vehicles and transport equipment, textiles, petroleum products
  partners:
    Switzerland, SACU (Southern African Customs Union), UK, US
External debt:
    $780 million (December 1990 est.)
Industrial production:
    growth rate 16.8% (FY86); accounts for about 57% of GDP, including mining
Electricity:
    220,000 kW capacity; 630 million kWh produced 858 kWh per capita (1991)
Industries:
    mining of diamonds, copper, nickel, coal, salt, soda ash, potash; livestock
    processing
Agriculture:
    accounts for only 3% of DGP; subsistence farming predominates; cattle
    raising supports 50% of the population; must import large share of food
    needs
Economic aid:
    US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $257 million; Western (non-US)
    countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $1,875 million; OPEC

:Brazil Economy

Overview:
    The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors, entered
    the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an unserviceable
    foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy direction. In addition,
    the economy remained highly regulated, inward-looking, and protected by
    substantial trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and
    mining facilities is divided among private interests - including several
    multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are
    private, with the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts
    between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
    violence. The Collor government, which assumed office in March 1990, is
    embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to modernize and
    reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy,
    and opening it to increased foreign competition. The government in December
    1991 signed a letter of intent with the IMF for a 20-month standby loan.
    Having reached an agreement on the repayment of interest arrears accumulated
    during 1989 and 1990, Brazilian officials and commercial bankers are engaged
    in talks on the reduction of medium- and long-term debt and debt service
    payments and on the elimination of remaining interest arrears. A major
    long-run strength is Brazil's vast natural resources.
