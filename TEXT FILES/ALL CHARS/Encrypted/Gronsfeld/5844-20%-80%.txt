:Turkey Economy

Overview:
    The impressive stream of benefits from the economic reforms that Turkey
    launched in 1980 have begun to peter out. Although real growth in per capita
    GDP averaged 5% annually between 1983 and 1988, recent economic performance
    has fallen substantially. Moreover, inflation and interest rates remain
    high, and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a
    country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally controlled
    to a free market economy. Agriculture remains an important economic sector,
    employing about half of the work force, accounting for 18% of GDP, and
    contributing 19% to exports. The government has launched a
    multibillion-dollar development program in the southeastern region, which
    includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to
    generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The planned
    tapping of huge additional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious
    concern in the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq. The Turkish
    economy emerged from the Gulf War of early 1991 in stronger shape than
    Ankara had expected. Although the negative effects of the crisis were felt
    primarily in the politically sensitive southeast, aid pledges by the
    coalition allies of more than $4 billion have helped offset the burden.

:Turkmenistan Economy

Overview:
    Like the other 15 former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan faces enormous
    problems of economic adjustment - to move away from Moscow-based central
    planning toward a system of decisionmaking by private enterpreneurs, local
    government authorities, and, hopefully, foreign investors. This process
    requires wholesale changes in supply sources, markets, property rights, and
    monetary arrangements. Industry - with 10% of the labor force - is heavily
    weighted toward the energy sector, which produced 11% of the ex-USSR's gas
    and 1% of its oil. Turkmenistan ranked second among the former Soviet
    republics in cotton production, mainly in the irrigated western region,
    where the huge Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya.
