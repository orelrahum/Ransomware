:Benin Economy

Overview:
    Benin is one of the least developed countries in the world because of
    limited natural resources and a poorly developed infrastructure. Agriculture
    accounts for about 35% of GDP, employs about 60% of the labor force, and
    generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings. The industrial sector
    contributes only about 15% to GDP and employs 2% of the work force. Low
    prices in recent years have kept down hard currency earnings from Benin's
    major exports of agricultural products and crude oil.

    with consumption

:Bhutan Economy

Overview:
    The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on agriculture and
    forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of the population and
    account for about 50% of GDP. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make
    the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The
    economy is closely aligned with that of India through strong trade and
    monetary links. Low wages in industry lead most Bhutanese to stay in
    agriculture. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on
    Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower potential and its attraction for
    tourists are its most important natural resources.

Leave them to God above; him serve, and fear!
Of other creatures, as him pleases best,
Wherever placed, let him dispose; joy thou
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise
And thy fair Eve; Heaven is for thee too high
To know what passes there; be lowly wise:
Think only what concerns thee, and thy being;
Dream not of other worlds, what creatures there
Live, in what state, condition, or degree;
Contented that thus far hath been revealed
Not of Earth only, but of highest Heaven.
To whom thus Adam, cleared of doubt, replied.
How fully hast thou satisfied me, pure
Intelligence of Heaven, Angel serene!
And, freed from intricacies, taught to live
The easiest way; nor with perplexiUP BMWWGQBW
