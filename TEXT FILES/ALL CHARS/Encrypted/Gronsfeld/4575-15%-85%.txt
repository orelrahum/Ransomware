:Monaco Economy

Overview:
    Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular resort,
    attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The Principality has
    successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added,
    nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes
    and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established
    residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices.
    About 50% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,
    banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism.
    Living standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to those in
    prosperous French metropolitan suburbs.
