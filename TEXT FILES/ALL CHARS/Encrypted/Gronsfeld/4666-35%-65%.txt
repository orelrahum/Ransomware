    still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are
    essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs
    nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local
    services, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some
    trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.
