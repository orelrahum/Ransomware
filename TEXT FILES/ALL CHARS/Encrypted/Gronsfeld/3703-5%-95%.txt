:Honduras Economy

Overview:
    Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
    Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for more
    than 25% of GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces two-thirds of
    exports. Productivity remains low. Industry, still in its early stages,
    employs nearly 9% of the labor force, accounts for 15% of GDP, and generates
    20% of exports. The service sectors, including public administration,
    account for 50% of GDP and employ nearly 20% of the labor force. Basic
    problems facing the economy include rapid population growth, high
    unemployment, sharply increased inflation, a lack of basic services, a large
    and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of the export sector
    mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations.
    Despite government efforts at reform and large-scale foreign assistance, the
    economy still is unable to take advantage of its sizable natural resources.

:Hong Kong Economy

Overview:
    Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or nontariff
    barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be
    imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18% of GDP, employs 28% of the
    labor force, and exports about 90% of its output. Real GDP growth averaged a
    remarkable 8% in 1987-88, then slowed to 2.5-3.0% in 1989-90. Unemployment,
    which has been declining since the mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of
    labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of living.
    Short-term prospects remain solid so long as major trading partners continue
    to be reasonably prosperous. The crackdown in China in 1989-91 casts a
    shadow over the longer term economic outlook.
