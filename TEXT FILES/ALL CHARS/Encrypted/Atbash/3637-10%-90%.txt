:Australia Economy

Overview:
    Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a per
    capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European countries.
    Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural
    products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Of the top 25 exports, 21 are
    primary products, so that, as happened during 1983-84, a downturn in world
    commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy. The government is
    pushing for increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
    international markets continues to be severe.
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $280.8 billion, per capita $16,200; real
    growth rate --0.6% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    3.3% (September 1991)

  commodities:
    manufactured raw materials, capital equipment, consumer goods
  partners:
    US 24%, Japan 19%, UK 6%, FRG 7%, NZ 4% (1990)
External debt:
    $130.4 billion (June 1991)
Industrial production:
    growth rate --0.9% (1991); accounts for 32% of GDP
Electricity:
    40,000,000 kW capacity; 155,000 million kWh produced, 8,960 kWh per capita
    (1991)
Industries:
    mining, industrial and transportation equipment, food processing, chemicals,
    steel, motor vehicles
Agriculture:
    accounts for 5% of GNP and 37% of export revenues; world's largest exporter
    of beef and wool, second-largest for mutton, and among top wheat exporters;
    major crops - wheat, barley, sugarcane, fruit; livestock - cattle, sheep,
    poultry
Illicit drugs:
    Tasmania is one of the world's major suppliers of licit opiate products;
    government maintains strict controls over areas of opium poppy cultivation
    and output of poppy straw concentrate
Economic aid:
    donor - ODA and OOF commitments (1970-89), $10.4 billion
Currency:
    Australian dollar (plural - dollars); 1 Australian dollar ($A) = 100 cents
