:Ghana Economy

Overview:
    Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been
    implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including
    moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily
    dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not
    spread substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending
    peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
    democratic government have been boosting government expenditures and
    undercutting structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in
    1990. Much of the economic improvement in 1991 was caused by favorable
    weather (following a severe drought the previous year) that led to plentiful
    harvests in Ghana's agriculturally based economy.

:Gibraltar Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends heavily on British defense expenditures, revenue from
    tourists, fees for services to shipping, and revenues from banking and
    finance activities. Because more than 70% of the economy is in the public
    sector, changes in government spending have a major impact on the level of
    employment. Construction workers are particularly affected when government
    expenditures are cut.
GNP:
    exchange rate conversion - $182 million, per capita $4,600; real growth rate
    5% (FY87)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    3.6% (1988)
Unemployment rate:
    NA%
Budget:
    revenues $136 million; expenditures $139 million, including capital
    expenditures of NA (FY88)
Exports:
