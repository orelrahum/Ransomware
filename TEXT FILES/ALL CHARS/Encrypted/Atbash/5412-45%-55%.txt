:Wallis and Futuna Economy

Overview:
    The economy is limited to traditional subsistence agriculture, with about
    80% of the labor force earning its livelihood from agriculture (coconuts and
    vegetables), livestock (mostly pigs), and fishing. About 4% of the
    population is employed in government. Revenues come from French Government
    subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import
    taxes, and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and
    Futuna imports food, fuel, clothing, machinery, and transport equipment, but
    its exports are negligible, consisting of copra and handicrafts.
