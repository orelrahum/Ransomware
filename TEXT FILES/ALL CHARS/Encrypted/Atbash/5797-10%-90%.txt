:Lithuania Economy

Overview:
    Lithuania is striving to become a small, independent, largely privatized
    economy rather than a segment of a huge, centrally planned economy. Although
    substantially above average in living standards and technology in the old
    USSR, Lithuania historically lagged behind Latvia and Estonia in economic
    development. It is ahead of its Baltic neighbors, however, in implementing
    market reform. The country has no important natural resources aside from its
    arable land and strategic location. Industry depends entirely on imported
    materials that have come from the republics of the former USSR. Lithuania
    benefits from its ice-free port at Klaipeda on the Baltic Sea and its rail
    and highway hub at Vilnius, which provides land communication between
    Eastern Europe and Russia, Latvia, Estonia, and Belarus. Industry produces a
    small assortment of high-quality products, ranging from complex machine
    tools to sophisticated consumer electronics. Thanks to nuclear power,
    Lithuania is presently self-sufficient in electricity, exporting its surplus
    to Latvia and Belarus; the nuclear facilities inherited from the USSR,
    however, have come under world scrutiny as seriously deficient in safety
    standards. Agriculture is efficient compared with most of the former Soviet
    Union. Lithuania holds first place in per capita consumption of meat, second
    place for eggs and potatoes, and fourth place for milk and dairy products.
    Grain must be imported to support the meat and dairy industries. As to
    economic reforms, Lithuania is pressing ahead with plans to privatize at
    least 60% of state-owned property (industry, agriculture, and housing)
    having already sold many small enterprises using a voucher system. Other
    government priorities include stimulating foreign investment by protecting
    the property rights of foreign firms and redirecting foreign trade away from
    Eastern markets to the more competitive Western markets. For the moment,
    Lithuania will remain highly dependent on Russia for energy, raw materials,
    grains, and markets for its products.

:Luxembourg Economy

Overview:
    The stable economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and negligible
    unemployment. Agriculture is based on small but highly productive
    family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently dominated by
    steel, has become increasingly more diversified, particularly toward
    high-technology firms. During the past decade, growth in the financial
    sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Services,
    especially banking, account for a growing proportion of the economy.
    Luxembourg participates in an economic union with Belgium on trade and most
    financial matters and is also closely connected economically to the
    Netherlands.

:Macau Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based largely on tourism (including gambling) and textile and

    about two-thirds of export earnings; the gambling industry represented 36%
    of GDP in 1991. Macau depends on China for most of its food, fresh water,
    and energy imports. Japan and Hong Kong are the main suppliers of raw
    materials and capital goods.
