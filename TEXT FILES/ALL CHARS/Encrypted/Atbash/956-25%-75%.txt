Where God resides, and ere mid-day arrived
In Eden; distance inexpressible
By numbers that have name.  But this I urge,
Admitting motion in the Heavens, to show
Invalid that which thee to doubt it moved;

Placed Heaven from Earth so far, that earthly sight,
If it presume, might err in things too high,
And no advantZTV TZRM.  DSZG RU GSV HFM
