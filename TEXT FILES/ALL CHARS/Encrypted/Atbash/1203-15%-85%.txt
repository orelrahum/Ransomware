:American Samoa Economy

Overview:
    Economic development is strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa
    does nearly 90% of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing
    plants are the backbone of the private-sector economy, with canned tuna the
    primary export. The tuna canneries and the government are by far the two
    largest employers. Other economic activities include a slowly developing
    tourist industry.
