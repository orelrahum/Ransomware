Note:
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank. As stated in the 1978 Camp David accords and
    reaffirmed by President Bush's post - Gulf crisis peace initiative, the
    final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, their relationship with their
    neighbors, and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated
    among the concerned parties. The Camp David accords also specify that these
    negotiations will resolve the location of the respective boundaries. Pending
    the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of the
    West Bank and Gaza Strip has yet to be determined.
