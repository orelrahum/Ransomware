With me, as I besought thee, when that strange
Desire of wandering, this unhappy morn,

Remained still happy; not, as now, despoiled
Of all our good; shamed, naked, miserable!

The faith they owe; when earnestly they seek
Such proof, conclude, they then begin to fail.

Of wandering, as thou callest it, which who knows
But might as ill have happened thou being by,
Or to thyself perhaps?  Hadst thou been there,
