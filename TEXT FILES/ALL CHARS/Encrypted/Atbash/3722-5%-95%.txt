:Korea, North Economy

Overview:
    More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; agricultural land is
    collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured goods.
    State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist
    country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the
    strict rule of KIM Il-song and his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during
    the period 1984-89 averaged 2-3%, but output declined by 2-4% annually
    during 1990-91, largely because of disruptions in economic relations with
    the USSR. Abundant natural resources and hydropower form the basis of
    industrial development. Output of the extractive industries includes coal,
    iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals.
    Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry, with light industry lagging far
    behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation,
    and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become
    self-sufficient in food production. Four consecutive years of poor harvests,
    coupled with distribution problems, have led to chronic food shortages.
    North Korea remains far behind South Korea in economic development and
    living standards.
