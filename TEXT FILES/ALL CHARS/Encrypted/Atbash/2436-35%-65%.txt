:Korea, North Economy

Overview:
    More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; agricultural land is
    collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured goods.
    State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist
    country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the
    strict rule of KIM Il-song and his son, KIM Chong-il. Economic growth during
    the period 1984-89 averaged 2-3%, but output declined by 2-4% annually
    during 1990-91, largely because of disruptions in economic relations with
    the USSR. Abundant natural resources and hydropower form the basis of
    industrial development. LFGKFG LU GSV VCGIZXGREV RMWFHGIRVH RMXOFWVH XLZO,
