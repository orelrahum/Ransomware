Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause!
But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way

In his first shape on Man; but many shapes
Of Death, and many are the ways that lead
To his grim cave, all dismal; yet to sense
More terrible at the entrance, than within.

By fire, flood, famine, by intemperance more
In meats and drinks, which on the earth shall brinT
