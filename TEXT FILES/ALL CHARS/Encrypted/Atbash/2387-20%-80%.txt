Overview:
    Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the late
    1970s and early 1980s, when its annual GNP growth averaged more than 10%. In
    the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in both Arab aid and worker
    remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly 2% per year.
    Imports - mainly oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food - have been
    outstripping exports, with the difference covered by aid, remittances, and
    borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling
    negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually
    reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The
    Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated Jordan's
    already serious economic problems, forcing the government to shelve the IMF
    program, stop most debt payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid
    from Gulf Arab states and worker remittances have plunged, and refugees have
    flooded the country, straining government resources. Economic recovery is
    unlikely without substantial foreign aid, debt relief, and economic reform.
