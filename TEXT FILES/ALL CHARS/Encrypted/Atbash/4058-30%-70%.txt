:Martinique Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and light industry.
    Agriculture accounts for about 12% of GDP and the small industrial sector
    for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used
    for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to
    France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be
    imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
    transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than
    agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the
    work force is employed in the service sector and in administration. In 1986
    per capita GDP was relatively high at $6,000. During 1986 the unemployment
    rate was 30% and was particularly severe among younger workers.
