:Tanzania Economy

Overview:
    Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy is
    heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 47% of GDP,
    provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Industry
    accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural
    products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced
    in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
    financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World BanP, GSV
