Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)

Note - also known as the Cooperation Council for the Arab States
of the Gulf

established - 25-26 May 1981


Overview:
    Civil war during 1990 destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the
    infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Expatriate businessmen fled the
    country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return.
    Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate
    favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
    products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in
    scope. Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction
    and repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who fled to neighboring
    countries. In 1991, the political impasse between the interim government and
    the rebel leader Charles Taylor prevented restoration of normal economic
    life.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $988 million, per capita $400; real growth rate
    1.5% (1988)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    12% (1989)
Unemployment rate:
    43% urban (1988)
Budget:
    revenues $242.1 million; expenditures $435.4 million, including capital
    expenditures of $29.5 million (1989)
Exports:
    $505 million (f.o.b., 1989 est.)
  commodities:
    iron ore 61%, rubber 20%, timber 11%, coffee
  partners:
    US, EC, Netherlands
Imports:
    $394 million (c.i.f., 1989 est.)
  commodities:
    rice, mineral fuels, chemicals, machinery, transportation equipment, other
    foodstuffs
  partners:
    US, EC, Japan, China, Netherlands, ECOWAS
External debt:
    $1.6 billion (December 1990 est.)
Industrial production:
    growth rate 1.5% in manufacturing (1987); accounts for 22% of GDP
Electricity:
    410,000 kW capacity; 750 million kWh produced, 275 kWh per capita (1991)
Industries:
    rubber processing, food processing, construction materials, furniture, palm
    oil processing, mining (iron ore, diamonds)
Agriculture:
    accounts for about 40% of GDP (including fishing and forestry); principal
    products - rubber, timber, coffee, cocoa, rice, cassava, palm oil,
    sugarcane, bananas, sheep, and goats; not self-sufficient in food, iiSVor|Y
