:Jersey Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and
    tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are
    important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy
    cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk
    products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector
    overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the
    island's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light
    industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry
    has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw
    material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
    Jersey's food needs.

    final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, their relationship with their
    neighbors, and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated
    among the concerned parties. The Camp David accords also specify that these
    negotiations will resolve the location of the respective boundaries. Pending
    the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of the
    West Bank and Gaza Strip has yet to be determined.
