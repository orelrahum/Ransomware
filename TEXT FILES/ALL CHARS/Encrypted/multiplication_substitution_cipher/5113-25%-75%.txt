Note:
    The Arab territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included
    in the data below. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed
    by President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of
    the West Bank and Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. The Camp David Accords further specify that these
    negotiations will resolve the location of the respective boundaries. Pending
    the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of the
    West Bank and Gaza Strip has yet to be determined (see West Bank and Gaza
    Strip entries). On 25 April 1982 Israel relinquished control of the Sinai to
    Egypt. Statistics for the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights are included in the
    Syria entry.

:Israel Economy

Overview:
    Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation. It
    depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military
    equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively
    developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years.
    Industry employs about 20% of Israeli workers, agriculture 5%, and services
    most of the rest. Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural
    products (fruits and vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts
    balance-of-payments deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments
    from abroad and by foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's $17
    billion external debt is owed to the United States, which is its major
    source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel
    has been targeting high-technology niches in international markets, such as
    medical scanning equipment. Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 dealt a
    blow to Israel's economy. Higher world oil prices added an estimated $300
    million to the oil import bill that year and helped keep annual inflation at
    18%. Regional tension and the continuing Palestinian uprising (intifadah)
    have contributed to a sharp drop in tourism - a key foreign exchange earner
    - to the lowest level since the 1973 Arab-Israeli war. The influx of Jewish
    immigrants from the former USSR, which topped 330,000 during the period
    1990-91, will increase unemployment, intensify housing problems, widen the
    government budget deficit, and fuel inflation.

:Italy Economy

Overview:
    Since World War II the economy has changed from one based on agriculture
    into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the same total and per
    capita output as France and the UK. The country is still divided into a
    developed industrial north, dominated by small private companies, and an
    undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public enterprises.
    Services account for 48% of GDP, industry about 35%, agriculture 4%, and
    public administration 13%. Most raw materials needed by industry and over
    75% of energy requirements must be imported. After growing at an annual
    average rate of 3% during the period 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in
    1991. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering
    communications system, curbing pollution in major industrial centers, and
    adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic
    integration of the European Community.
