    lasts about 10 months; permafrost in islands; virtually icelocked from
    October to June; fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from
    disruptions or damage
Note:
    major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea (northern access to the Pacific
    Ocean via the Bering Strait); ships subject to superstructure icing from
    October to May; strategic location between North America and Russia;
    shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia,
    floating research stations operated by the US and Russia
