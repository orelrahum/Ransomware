:Tunisia Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends primarily on petroleum, phosphates, tourism, and exports
    of light manufactures. Following two years of drought-induced economic
    decline, the economy made a strong recovery in 1990 as a result of a
    bountiful harvest, continued export growth, and higher domestic investment.
    Continued high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular support for
    the government, however, and forced Tunis to slow the pace of economic
    reform. Nonetheless, the government appears committed to implementing its
    IMF-supported structural adjustment program and to servicing its foreign
    debt.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $10.9 billion, per capita $1,320; real growth
    rate 3.5% (1991)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    8.2% (1991)
Unemployment rate:
    15% (1991)
Budget:
    revenues $3.8 billion; expenditures $5.4 billion, including capital
    expenditures of $970 million (1992 est.Al
