    shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance-of-payments
    problem. Production of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm
    kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of
    exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
    of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs.
    It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the years,
    Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which amounts to
    roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential exists for
    development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to
    expand facilities in recent years. The government also implemented a
    Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the economy and reschedule
    external debt service payments in cooperation with the International
    Development Association and Western lenders.

:Saudi Arabia Economy

Overview:
    The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 70% of budget revenues, 37% of
    GDP, and almost all export earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves
    of petroleum in the world, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and
    plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the government intends to
    encourage private economic activity and to foster the gradual process of
    turning Saudi Arabia into a modern industrial state that retains traditional
    Islamic values.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $104 billion, per capita $5,800; real growth rate
