:Namibia Economy

Overview:

    process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost 25% of GDP. Namibia
    is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa and the world's
    fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond deposits are among the
    richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for gem-quality
    diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver,
    and tungsten, and it has substantial resources of coal. More than half the
    population depends on agriculture (largely subsistence agriculture) for its
    livelihood.

:Nauru Economy

Overview:
    Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
    expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans
    one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World - $10,000 annually.
    Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be imported, including
    fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the
    replacement of income from phosphates are serious long-term problems.
    Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
    cushion the transition.
GNP:
    exchange rate conversion - over $90 million, per capita $10,000; real growth
    rate NA% (1989)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
