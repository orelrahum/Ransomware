:Italy Economy

Overview:
    Since World War II the economy has changed from one based on agriculture
    into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the same total and per
    capita output as France and the UK. The country is still divided into a
    developed industrial north, dominated by small private companies, and an
    undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public enterprises.
    Services account for 48% of GDP, industry about 35%, agriculture 4%, and
    public administration 13%. Most raw materials needed by industry and over
    75% of energy requirements must be imported. After growing at an annual
    average rate of 3% during the period 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in
    1991. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of refurbishing a tottering
    communications system, curbing pollution in major industrial centers, and
    adjusting to the new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing economic
    integration of the European Community.
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $965.0 billion, per capita $16,700; real
    growth rate 1.0% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    6.5% (1991)
Unemployment rate:
    11.0% (1991 est.)
Budget:
    revenues $431 billion; expenditures $565 billion, including capital
    expenditures of $48 billion (1991)
Exports:
    $209 billion (f.o.b., 1991)
  commodities:
    textiles, wearing apparel, metals, transportation equipment, chemicals
  partners:
    EC 58.5%, US 8%, OPEC 4%
Imports:
    $222 billion (c.i.f., 1991)
  commodities:
    petroleum, industrial machinery, chemicals, metals, food, agricultural
    products
  partners:
    EC 58%, OPEC 7%, US 5%
External debt:
    NA
Industrial production:
    growth rate - 2.0% (1991); accounts for almost 35% of GDP
Electricity:
    57,500,000 kW capacity; 235,000 million kWh produced, 4,072 kWh per capita
