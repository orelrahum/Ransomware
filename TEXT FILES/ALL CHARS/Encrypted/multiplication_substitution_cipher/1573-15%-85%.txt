:Cambodia Economy

Overview:
    Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic development has been
    stymied by deadly political infighting. The economy is based on agriculture
    and related industries. Over the past decade Cambodia has been slowly
    recovering from its near destruction by war and political upheaval. The food
    situation remains precarious; during the 1980s famine was averted only
    through international relief. In 1986 the production level of rice, the
    staple food crop, was able to meet only 80% of domestic needs. The biggest
    success of the nation's recovery program has been in new rubber plantings
    and in fishing. Industry, other than rice procesYYi_M, iY GlSoY| _o_%xiY|%_|A
