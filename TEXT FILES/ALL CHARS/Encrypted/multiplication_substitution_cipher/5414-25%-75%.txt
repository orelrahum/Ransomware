:Western Samoa Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture employs more than half of the labor force, contributes 50% to
    GDP, and furnishes 90% of exports. The bulk of export earnings comes from
    the sale of coconut oil and copra. The economy depends on emigrant
    remittances and foreign aid to support a level of imports several times
    export earnings. Tourism has become the most important growth industry, and
    construction of the first international hotel is under way.

:World Economy

Overview:
    Aggregate world output in 1991 increased by 1.3%, in contrast to estimated
    2% growth in 1990 and 3% growth in 1989. In 1991, the developed countries
    grew by 2.5% and the LDCs by 3.5%, these gains being offset by a 10-15% drop
    in the former Communist-dominated areas of the USSR and Eastern Europe. As
    usual, results among individual countries differed widely. In the developed
    group, Japan led with 4.5%, the West European members averaged 1.2%, and the
    recession-plagued United States lagged,with GDP down 0.7%. As for the 15
    former Soviet republics and the seven nations of Eastern Europe, output
    plummeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the
    rules of the game and in the channels of production and exchange. China and
    the Four Dragons performed well in 1991 but many of the other developing
    countries are mired in poverty and political instability. For the world as a
    whole, the addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already
    overcrowded globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution,
    desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine.
GWP (gross world product):

    rate 1.3% (1991 est.)

Electricity:

    capita (1990)
Industries:
    industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology, especially in
    computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical
    equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a small
    portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
    technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial
    nations and the less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid
    development of new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating
    already grim environmental problems

:World Economy

Agriculture:
    the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last
    20 years. The annual production of cereals, for instance, has risen by 50%,
    from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion metric tons;
    production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
    increases in planted areas; while global production is sufficient for
    aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's population remains
    malnourished, primarily because local production cannot adequately provide
    for large and rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for
    food imports; conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
    recent years has exacerbated the consequences of all other factors

:Yemen Economy

Overview:
    Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united Yemen,
    the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, is the
    economic and commercial capital. Future economic development depends heavily
    on Western-assisted development of promising oil resources. South Yemen's
    willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet
    economic support.
Overview:
  North:
    The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen
    dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential needs. Large trade
    deficits have been made up for by remittances from Yemenis working abroad
    and foreign aid. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern Yemen has
    become a major import|%rA fG_J o_c% uY%J for %xVor| croVY S co||o_, frui|,
