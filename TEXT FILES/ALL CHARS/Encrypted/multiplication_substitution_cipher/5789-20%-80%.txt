:Kazakhstan Economy

Overview:
    The second-largest in area of the 15 former Soviet republics, Kazakhstan has
    vast oil, coal, and agricultural resources. Kazakhstan is highly dependent
    on trade with Russia, exchanging its natural resources for finished consumer
    and industrial goods. Kazakhstan now finds itself with serious pollution
    problems, backward technology, and little experience in foreign markets. The
    government in 1991 pushed privatization of the economy at a faster pace than
    Russia's program. The ongoing transitional period - marked by sharp
    inflation in wages and prices, lower output, lost jobs, and disruption of
    time-honored channels of supply - has brought considerable social unrest.
    Kazakhstan lacks the funds, technology, and managerial skills for a quick
    recovery of output. US firms have been enlisted to increase oil output but
    face formidable obstacles; for example, oil can now reach Western markets
    only through pipelines that run across independent (and sometimes
    unfriendly) former Soviet republics. Finally, the end of monolithic
    Communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open. The 6 million
    Russians in the republic, formerly the favored class, now face the hostility
    of a society dominated by Muslims. Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the
    formidable obstacles to the creation of a productive, technologically
    advancing society.

:Kenya Economy

Overview:
    Kenya's 3.6% annual population growth rate - one of the highest in the world
    - presents a serious problem for the country's economy. In the meantime, GDP
    growth in the near term has kept slightly ahead of population - annually
    averaging 4.9% in the 1986-90 period. Undependable weather conditions and a
    shortage of arable land hamper long-term growth in agriculture, the leading
    economic sector. In 1991, deficient rainfall, stagnant export volume, and
    sagging export prices held economic growth below the all-important
    population growth figure.
