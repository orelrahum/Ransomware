    spending for social welfare has risen slightly. In 1991 growth in GDP
    recovered to 5.5% (led by consumer spending) after only 2.1% growth in 1990.
    The tight monetary policy of 1990 helped cut the rate of inflation from
    27.3% in 1990 to 18.7% in 1991. Despite a 12% drop in copper prices, the
    trade surplus rose in 1991, and international reserves increased.
    Inflationary pressures are not expected to ease much in 1992, and economic
    growth is likely to approach 7%.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $30.5 billion, per capita $2,300; real growth
    rate 5.5% (1991 est.)
