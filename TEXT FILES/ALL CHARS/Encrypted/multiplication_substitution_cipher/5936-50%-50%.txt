:Burma Economy

Overview:
    Burma is a poor Asian country, with a per capita GDP of about $500. The
    nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export
    earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity exports.
    For rice, traditionally the most important export, the drop in world prices
    has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales. In
    1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this
    position. The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which
    generates about 40% of GDP and provides employment for 65% of the work
    force. Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces
    and has been trying to encourage foreign investment, so far with little
    success.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $22.2 billion, per capita $530; real growth rate
    5.6% (1991)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):

Budget:

    expenditures of $6 billion (1991)

External debt:
    $4.2 billion (1991)
Industrial production:
    growth rate 2.6% (FY90 est.); accounts for 10% of GDP
Electricity:
    950,000 kW capacity; 2,900 million kWh produced, 70 kWh per capita (1990)

    export revenues; fish catch of 740,000 metric tons (FY90)

    cannabis for the international drug trade; opium production is on the
    increase as growers respond to the collapse of Rangoon's antinarcotic
    programs
