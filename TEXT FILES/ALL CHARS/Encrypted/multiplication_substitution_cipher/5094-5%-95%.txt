:Georgia Economy

Overview:
    Among the former Soviet republics, Georgia is noted for its Black Sea
    tourist industry, its large output of citrus fruits and tea, and the amazing
    diversity of an industrial sector that accounted, however, for less than 2%
    of the USSR's output. Another salient characteristic of the economy has been
    a flourishing private sector (compared with the other republics). Almost 30%
    of the labor force is employed in agriculture and 18% in industry. Mineral
    resources consist of manganese and copper, and, to a lesser extent,
    molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury. Except for very small quantities
    of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must be imported from neighboring
    republics. Oil and its products are delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to
    the port of Batumi for export and local refining. Gas is supplied in
    pipelines from Krasnodar and Stavropol'. Georgia is nearly self-sufficient
    in electric power, thanks to abundant hydropower stations as well as some
    thermal power stations. The dismantling of central economic controls is
    being delayed by political factionalism, marked by armed struggles between
    the elected government and the opposition, and industrial output seems to
    have fallen more steeply in Georgia in 1991 than in any other of the former
    Soviet republics. To prevent further economic decline, Georgia must
    establish domestic peace and must maintain economic ties to the other former
    Soviet republics while developing new links to the West.
