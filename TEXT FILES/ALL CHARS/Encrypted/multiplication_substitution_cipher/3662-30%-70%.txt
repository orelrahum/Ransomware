:Central African Republic Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture, including forestry, is the backbone of the CAR
    economy, with more than 70% of the population living in the countryside. In
    1988 the agricultural sector generated about 40% of GDP. Agricultural
    products accounted for about 60% of export earnings and the diamond industry
    for 30%. The country's 1991 budget deficit was US $70 million and in 1992 is
    expected to be about the same. Important constraints to economic development
    include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, and a
    weak human resource base. Multilateral and bilateral development assistance,
    particularly from France, plays a major role in providing capital for new
    investment.
