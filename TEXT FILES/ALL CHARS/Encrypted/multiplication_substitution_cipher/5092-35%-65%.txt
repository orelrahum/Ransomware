:Gabon Economy

Overview:
    The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until the early 1970s, is now
    dominated by the oil sector. During the period 1981-85, oil accounted for
    about 46% of GDP, 83% of export earnings, and 65% of government revenues on
    average. The high oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial
    increase in per capita income, stimulated domestic demand, reinforced
    migration from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real wages to
    among the highest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The three-year slide of Gabon's
    economy, which began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989
    because of a near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows. In 1990 the
    economy posted strong growth despite serious strikes, but debt servicing
    problems are hindering economic advancement. The agricultural and industrial
    sectors are relatively underdeveloped, except for oil.
