    highest average tax burdens in the world (54%). A small country with a high
    dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of raw
    materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small- and
    medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations. The
    country is richly endowed with natural resources - petroleum, hydropower,
    fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent on its oil sector to
    keep its economy afloat. Although one of the government's main priorities is
    to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve for years
    to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and
    diversify the economy through tax reform and an expansionary 1992 budget.
    Forecasters predict that economic growth will rise slightly in 1992 because
    of public-sector expansion and moderate improvements in private investment
    and demand. Inflation will remain about 3%, while unemployment continues at
    record levels of over 5% because of the weakness of the economy outside the
    oil sector. Oslo, a member of the European Free Trade Area, is continuing to
    deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the European
    Economic Area (EEA) - which creates a EC/EFTA market with free movement of
    capital, goods, services, and labor - which takes effect in 1993.
