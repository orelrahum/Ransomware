:Kyrgyzstan Economy

Overview:
    Kyrgyzstan's small economy (less than 1% of the total for the former Soviet
    Union) is oriented toward agriculture, producing mainly livestock such as
    goats and sheep, as well as cotton, grain, and tobacco. Industry,
    concentrated around Bishkek, produces small quantities of electric motors,
    livestock feeding equipment, washing machines, furniture, cement, paper, and
    bricks. Mineral extraction is small, the most important minerals being rare
    earth metals and gold. Kyrgyzstan is a net importer of most types of food
    and fuel but is a net exporter of electricity. By early 1991, the Kirghiz
    leadership had accelerated reform, primarily by privatizing business and
    granting life-long tenure to farmers. In 1991 overall industrial and
    livestock output declined substantially.
