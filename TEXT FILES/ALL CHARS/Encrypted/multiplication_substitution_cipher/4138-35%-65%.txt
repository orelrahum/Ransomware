:Yemen Economy

Overview:
    Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united Yemen,
    the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, is the
    economic and commercial capital. Future economic development depends heavily
    on Western-assisted development of promising oil resources. South Yemen's
    willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet
    economic support.
Overview:
  North:
    The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen
    dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential needs. Large trade
    deficits have been made up for by remittances from Yemenis working abroad
    and foreign aid. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern Yemen has
    become a major importer. Land once used for export crops - cotton, fruit,
    and vegetables - has been turned over to growing qat, a mildly narcotic
    shrub chewed by Yemenis which has no significant export market. Oil export
    revenues started flowing in late 1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about
    $800 million.
  South:
    This has been one of the poorest Arab countries, with a per capita GNP of
    about $500. A shortage of natural resources, a widely dispersed population,
    and an arid climate have made economic development difficult. The economy
    has grown at an average annual rate of only 2-3% since the mid-1970s. The
    economy had been organized along socialist lines, dominated by the public
    sector. Economic growth has been constrained by a lack of incentives, partly
    stemming from centralized control over production decisions, investment
    allocation, and import choices.
