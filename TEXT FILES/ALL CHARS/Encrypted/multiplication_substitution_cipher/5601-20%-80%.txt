:Reunion Economy

Overview:
    The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Sugarcane has been
    the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts for
    85% of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a tourist
    industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third
    of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is
    extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and
    Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
    population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups
    suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the
    African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991
    illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic
    well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from
    France.
