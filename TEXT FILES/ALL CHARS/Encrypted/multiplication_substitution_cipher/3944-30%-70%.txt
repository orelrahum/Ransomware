:Croatia Economy

Overview:
    Before the political disintegration of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia
    stood next to Slovenia as the most prosperous and industrialized area, with
    a per capita output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps
    one-third above the Yugoslav average. Serbia and the Serb-dominated army of
    the old Yugoslavia, however, have seized Croatian territory, and the
    overriding determinant of Croatia's long-term economic prospects will be the
    final border settlement. Under the most favorable circumstances, Croatia
    will retain the Dalmatian coast with its major tourist attractions and
    Slavonia with its oilfields and rich agricultural land. Even so, Croatia
    would face monumental problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime
    Communist mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; damage during
    the fighting to bridges, factories, powerlines, buildings, and houses; and
    the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav
    republics. At the minimum, extensive Western aid and investment, especially
    in the tourist and oil industries, would seem necessary to salvage a
    desperate economic situation. However, peace and political stability must
    come first.

:Cuba Economy

Overview:
    The economy, centrally planned and largely state owned, is highly dependent
    on the agricultural sector and foreign trade. Sugar provided about
    two-thirds of export revenues in 1991, and over half was exported to the
    former Soviet republics. The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies
    that have deemphasized material incentives in the workplace, abolished
    farmers' informal produce markets, and raised prices of government-supplied
    goods and services. In 1990 the economy probably fell 5% largely as a result
    of declining trade with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Recently
    the government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and
    China. Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982. The
    government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist facilities
    and in industrial plants idled by falling imports from the former Soviet
    Union. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic foods, and nickel.
    The annual Soviet subsidy dropped from $4 billion in 1990 to about $1
    billion in 1991 because of a lower price paid for Cuban sugar and a sharp
    decline in Soviet exports to Cuba. The former Soviet republics have
    indicated they will no longer extend aid to Cuba beginning in 1992. Instead
    of highly subsidized trade, Cuba has been shifting to trade at market prices
    in convertible currencies. Because of increasingly severe shortages of
    fuels, industrial raw materials, and spare parts, aggregate output dropped
    by one-fifth in 1991.

:Cyprus Economy

Overview:
    The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous. Industry
    contributes 24% to GDP and employs 35% of the labor force, while the service
    sector contributes 44% to GDP and employs 45% of the labor force. Rapid
    growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in tourism
    have played important roles in the average 6.4% rise in GDP between 1985 and
    1990. In mid-1991, the World Bank "graduated" Cyprus off its list of
    developing countries. In contrast to the bright picture in the south, the
    Turkish Cypriot economy has less than half the per capita GDP and suffered a
    series of reverses in 1991. Crippled by the effects of the Gulf war, the
    collapse of the fruit-to-electronics conglomerate, Polly Peck, Ltd., and a
    drought, the Turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibillion-dollar grant
    from Turkey to help ease the burden of the economic crisis. Turkey normally
    underwrites a substantial portion of the TRNC economy.
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent - Greek area: $5.5 billion, per capita $9,600;
    real growth rate 6.0%; Turkish area: $600 million,, V%r cGVi|G Jx,DDD2 r%Gl
