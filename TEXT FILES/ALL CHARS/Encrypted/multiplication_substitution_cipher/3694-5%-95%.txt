:Greenland Economy

Overview:
    Over the past 25 years, the economy has changed from one based on
    subsistence whaling, hunting, and fishing to one dependent on foreign trade.
    Fishing is still the most important industry, accounting for over 75% of
    exports and about 25% of the population's income. Maintenance of a social
    welfare system similar to Denmark's has given the public sector a dominant
    role in the economy. In 1990, the economy became critically dependent on
    shrimp exports and on an annual subsidy (now about $500 million) from the
    Danish Government because cod exports dropped off and commercial mineral
    production stopped. As of 1992, the government also has taken control of the
    health sector from Denmark. The new Home Rule government installed in March
    1991 has decided to end much of the central control of the economy and to
    open it wider to competitive forces.

:Grenada Economy

Overview:
    The economy is essentially agricultural and centers on the traditional
    production of spices and tropical plants. Agriculture accounts for about 16%
    of GDP and 80% of exports and employs 24% of the labor force. Tourism is the
    leading foreign exchange earner, followed by agricultural exports.
    Manufacturing remains relatively undeveloped, but is expected to grow, given
    a more favorable private investment climate since 1983. Despite an
    impressive average annual growth rate for the economy of 5.5% during the
    period 1986-91, unemployment remains high at about 25%.
