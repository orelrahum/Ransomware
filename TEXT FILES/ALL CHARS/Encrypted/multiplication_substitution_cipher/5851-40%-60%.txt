:Uzbekistan Economy

Overview:
    Although Uzbekistan accounted for only 3.4% of total Soviet output, it
    produced two-thirds of the USSR's cotton. Moscow's push for ever-increasing
    amounts of cotton included massive irrigation projects which caused
    extensive environmental damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic.
    Furthermore, the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive
    pollution and widespread health problems. Recently the republic has sought
    to encourage food production at the expense of cotton. The small industrial
    sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery, mineral
    fertilizers, vegetable oil, and electrical cranes. Uzbekistan also has some
    important natural resources including gold (about 30% of Soviet production),
    uranium, and natural gas. The Uzbek government has encouraged land reform
    but has shied away from other aspects of economic reform.
