Educators, critics, and others will want a layered structure--one that
defines or links paths through the layers to allow users to reach

databases as well as a database of Renaissance culture).  This ability to
organize resources, to build things out of multiple other things on the
network or select pieces of it, reprr%Y%_|%J for fY"}@ o_% of |"% (%5
