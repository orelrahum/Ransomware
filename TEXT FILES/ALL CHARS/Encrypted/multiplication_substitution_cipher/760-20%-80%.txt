Confusion worse confounded; and Heaven-gates
Poured out by millions her victorious bands,
Pursuing. I upon my frontiers here
Keep residence; if all I can will serve
That little which is left so to defend,
Encroached on still through our intestine broils

Hung o'er my realm, linked in a golden chain
To that side Heaven from whence your legions fell!

So much the nearer danger. Go, and speed;
Havoc, and spoil, and ruin, are my gain."

With fresh alacrity and force renewed
