:Paraguay Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GDP, employs
    about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has
    no known significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
    hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared
    with the boom period of 1976-81, when real GDP grew at an average annual
    rate of nearly 11%. During the period 1982-86 real GDP fell in three of five
    years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32%, and foreign debt rose.
    Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the
    completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak
    international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy
    experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and
    stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery
    continued through 1990, on the strength of bumper crops in 1988-89. In a
    major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in
    March 1991 joined the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes
    Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. During 1991 the government began to more
    seriously address its arrearages with international creditors and its
    domestic fiscal problems. Inflation was cut in third, but the foreign trade
    deficit widened to more than $1 billion. For the long run, the government
    must press forward with general market-oriented economic reforms.

:Peru Government

Long-form name:
    Republic of Peru
Type:
    in transition, President FUJIMORI on 5 April 1992 suspended the constitution
    and dissolved the legislative and judicial branches
Capital:
    Lima
Administrative divisions:
    24 departments (departamentos, singular - departamento) and 1 constitutional
    province* (provincia constitucional); Amazonas, Ancash, Apurimac, Arequipa,
    Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Callao*, Cusco, Huancavelica, Huanuco, Ica, Junin, La
    Libertad, Lambayeque, Lima, Loreto, Madre de Dios, Moquegua, Pasco, Piura,
    Puno, San Martin, Tacna, Tumbes, Ucayali; note - the 1979 Constitution and
    legislation enacted from 1987 to 1990 mandate the creation of regions
    (regiones, singular - region) intended to function eventually as autonomous
    economic and administrative entities; so far, 12 regions have been
    constituted from 23 existing departments - Amazonas (from Loreto), Andres
    Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from Arequipa),
    Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from Cusco, Madre de
    Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad (from La Libertad), Los Libertadores-Huari

    Nor Oriental del Maranon (from Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin
    (from San Martin), Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has
    been delayed by the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to
    merge with the department of Lima; because of inadequate funding from the
    central government, the regions have yet to assume their responsibilities
    and at the moment coexist with the departmental structure
