:Canada Economy

Overview:
    As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles
    the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic system, and pattern of
    production. Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
    mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
    economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada
    registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations,
    averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force,
    and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. However,
    the continuing constitutional impasse between English- and French-speaking
    areas has observers discussing a possible split in the confederation;
    foreign investors are becoming edgy.

:Cape Verde Economy

Overview:
    Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base, a
    17-year drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service oriented, with
    commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 65% of GDP during
    the period 1985-88. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
    areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the fishing sector accounts
    for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly
    lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only
    3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by
    remittances from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the
    new democratic government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the
    private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.
