:Man, Isle of Economy

Overview:
    Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the economy.
    The government's policy of offering incentives to high-technology companies
    and financial institutions to locate on the island has paid off in expanding
    employment opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture
    and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in their
    shares of GNP. Banking now contributes over 20% to GNP and manufacturing
    about 15%. Trade is mostly with the UK.
GNP:
    exchange rate conversion - $490 million, per capita $7,573; real growth rate
    NA% (1988)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
