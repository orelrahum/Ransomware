:Antigua and Barbuda Economy

Overview:
    The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism the most important
    determinant of economic performance. During the period 1987-90, real GDP
    expanded at an annual average rate of about 6%. Tourism makes a direct
    contribution to GDP of about 13% and also affects growth in other sectors -
    particularly in construction, communications, and public utilities. Although
    Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a
    labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it was hurt in 1991 by a
    downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US recession.
