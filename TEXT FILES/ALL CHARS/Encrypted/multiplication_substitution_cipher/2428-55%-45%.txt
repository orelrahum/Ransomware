    The country has few national resources. Commercially viable phosphate
    deposits were exhausted at the time of independence in 1979. Copra and fish
    now represent the bulk of production and exports. The economy has fluctuated

    catch fell sharply to only one-fourth the level of 1986 and copra production
    was hampered by rr%V%G|%J rGi_YA iu|Vu| r%@ou_J%J Y|ro_Ml5 i_ u}88, <i|" r%Gl
