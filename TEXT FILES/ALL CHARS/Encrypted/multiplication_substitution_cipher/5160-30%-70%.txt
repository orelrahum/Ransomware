:Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture, dominated by banana production, is the most important sector of
    the economy. The services sector, based mostly on a growing tourist
    industry, is also important. The economy continues to have a high
    unemployment rate of 30% because of an overdependence on the weather-plagued
    banana crop as a major export earner. Government progress toward
    diversifying into new industries has been relatively unsuccessful.

    exchange rate conversion - $146 million, per capita $1,300; real growth rate
    5.9% (1989)
