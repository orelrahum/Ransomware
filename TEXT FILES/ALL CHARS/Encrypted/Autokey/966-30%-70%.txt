What callest thou solitude?  Is not the Earth
With various living creatures, and the air
Replenished, and all these at thy command
To come and play before thee?  Knowest thou not
Their language and their ways?  They also know,
And reason not contemptibly:  With these
Find pastime, and bear rule; thy realm is large.
So spake the Universal Lord, and seemed
So ordering:  M, NQGN TAIOL ZJ SKISHZ XQTNVZQS,
