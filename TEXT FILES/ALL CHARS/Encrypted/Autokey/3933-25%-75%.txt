:Cape Verde Economy

Overview:
    Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base, a
    17-year drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service oriented, with
    commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 65% of GDP during
    the period 1985-88. Although nearly 70% of the population lives in rural
    areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 16%; the fishing sector accounts
    for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly
    lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only
    3.5% of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by
    remittances from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the
    new democratic government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the
    private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.

    1988 the agricultural sector generated about 40% of GDP. Agricultural
    products accounted for about 60% of export earnings and the diamond industry
    for 30%. The country's 1991 budget deficit was US $70 million and in 1992 is
    expected to be about the same. Important constraints to economic development
    include the CAR's landlocked position, a poor transportation system, and a
    weak human resource base. Multilateral and bilateral development assistance,
    particularly from France, plays a major role in providing capital for new
    investment.

Rolling in dust and gore.  To which our sire.
Alas! both for the deed, and for the cause!
But have I now seen Death?  Is this the way
I must return to native dust?  O sight
Of terrour, foul and ugly to behold,
