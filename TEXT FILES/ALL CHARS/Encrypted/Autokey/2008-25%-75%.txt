:The Gambia Economy

Overview:
    The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural resources and has a
    limited agricultural base. It is one of the world's poorest countries with a
    per capita income of about $230. About 75% of the population is engaged in
    crop production and livestock raising, which contribute 30% to GDP.
    Small-scale manufacturing activity - processing peanuts, fish, and hides -
    accounts for less than 10% of GDP. Tourism is a growing industry. The Gambia
    imports one-third of its food, all fuel, and most manufactured goods.
    Exports are concentrated on peanut products (about 75% of total value).
