:Aruba Economy

Overview:

    refining and storage are also important. Hotel capacity expanded rapidly

    steadily declined from about 20% in 1986 to about 3% in 1991. The reopening
    of the local oil refinery, once a major source of employment and foreign
    exchange earnings, promises to give the economy an additional boost.
