Telecommunications:
    the telephone system is inadequate for a large industrial country,
    consisting of about 36 million lines of which only about 3% are switched
    automatically; as of 31 January 1990, 10.8 million applications for
    telephones for household use could not be satisfied; telephone density is 11
    per 100 persons; international connections are made via satellite, land
    line, microwave, and outdated submarine cables, and are generally
    unsatisfactory; the international gateway switch in Moscow handles
    international traffic for the other former Soviet republics as well as for
    Russia; broadcast stations - 1,050 AM/FM/SW (reach 98.6% of population), 310
    TV (580 repeaters) (reach 98% of population); satellite ground stations -
    INTELSAT, Intersputnik, INMARSAT, Orbita

:Rwanda Economy

Overview:
    Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and tea make up
    80-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and
    deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The industrial sector
    in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. Manufacturing focuses
    mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy
    remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid. Weak international
    prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
    decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
    October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October, has dampened any
    prospects for economic improvement.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $2.1 billion, per capita $300; real growth rate
