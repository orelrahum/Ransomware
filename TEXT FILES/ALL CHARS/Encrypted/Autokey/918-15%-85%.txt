Or faint retreat; when the great Son of God
To all his host on either hand thus spake.

Ye Angels armed; this day from battle rest:

Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew
The punishment to other hand belongs;
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:
Number to this day's work is not ordained,
Nor multitude; stand only, and behold
God's indignation on thesR ZVHDIYG SZYJWS
