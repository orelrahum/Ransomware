:Afghanistan Economy

    Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly
    dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and
    goats). Economic considerations, however, have played second fiddle to
    political and military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including
    the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupatKIC (WAQQU AULGK 15 JREVXFVZ
    1989). VZPC HVZ TRLA HTCSWH, SPE-WLWEH HM BYH DTIBPPHXIY FEMR GMP GRNUXTM,
