:Hungary Economy

Overview:
    Hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition between a command and a
    market economy. Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable export
    earnings and meeting domestic food needs. Industry accounts for about 40% of
    GDP and 30% of employment. Hungary claims that less than 20% of foreign
    trade is now with former CEMA countries, while about 70% is with OECD
    members. Hungary's economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it
    a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment.
    In 1990, Hungary received half of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe
    and in 1991 received the largest single share. The growing private sector
    accounts for one-quarter to one-third of national output according to
    unofficial estimates. Privatization of state enterprises is progressing,
    although excessive redtape, bureaucratic oversight, and uncertainties about
    pricing have slowed the process. Escalating unemployment and high rates of
    inflation may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform,
    while Hungary's heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to
    introduce full convertability of the forint before 1993.
