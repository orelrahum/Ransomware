:Fiji Economy

Overview:
    Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large subsistence sector.
    Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange, and sugar processing
    accounts for one-third of industrial output. Industry, including sugar
    milling, contributes 13% to GDP. Fiji traditionally had earned considerable
    sums of hard currency from the 250,000 tourists who visited each year. In
    1987, however, after two military coups, the economy went into decline. GDP
    dropped by 7.8% in 1987 and by another 2.5% in 1988; political uncertainty
    created a drop in tourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar
    production to fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong
    performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1990 the
    economy received a setback from cyclone Sina, which cut sugar output by an
    estimated 21%.
