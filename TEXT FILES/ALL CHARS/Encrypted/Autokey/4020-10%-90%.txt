:Serbia and Montenegro Economy

Overview:
    The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been accompanied by bloody
    ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and the breakup
    of important interrepublic trade flows. The situation in Serbia and
    Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military
    strife. This new state faces major economic problems. First, like the other
    former Yugoslav republics, Serbia and Montenegro depended on their sister
    republics for large amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and
    manufactures. Wide varieties in climate, mineral resources, and levels of
    technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence, as did
    the Communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
    number of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp
    drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets, and the
    destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the
    economic difficulties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic
    situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a
    Communist government that is primarily interested in political and military
    mastery, not economic reform. A further complication is the major economic
    sanctions by the leading industrial nations.

    production (sheep and cattle) and dairy farming prosper; Kosovo province
    produces fruits, vegetables, tobacco, and a small amount of cereals; the

:Haiti Economy

Overview:
    About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is mainly
    small-scale subsistence farming and employs nearly three-fourths of the work
    force. The majority of the population does not have ready access to safe
    drinking water, adequate medical care, or sufficient food. Few social
    assistance programs exist, and the lack of employment opportunities remains
    one of the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil
    erosion and political instability. Trade sanctions applied by the
    Organization of American States in response to the September 1991 coup
    against President Aristide have further damaged the economy.
