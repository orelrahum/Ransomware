:Seychelles Economy

Overview:
    In this small, open, tropical island economy, the tourist industry employs

    in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the
    government has moved to reduce the high dependence on tourism by promoting
    the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing.

:Sierra Leone Economy

Overview:
    The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed. Subsistence
    agriculture dominates the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and
    employing about two-thirds of the working population. Manufacturing, which
    accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw
    materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining
    provides an important source of hard currency. The economy suffers from high
    unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing
