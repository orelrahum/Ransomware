:Australia Economy

Overview:
    Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a per
    capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European countries.
    Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural
    products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Of the top 25 exports, 21 are
    primary products, so that, as happened during 1983-84, a downturn in world
    commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy. The government is
    pushing for increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
    international markets continues to be severe.

    purchasing power equivalent - $280.8 billion, per capita $16,200; real
    growth rate --0.6% (1991 est.)

    (1991)
Industries:
    mining, industrial and transportation equipment, food processing, chemicals,
    steel, motor vehicles
Agriculture:
    accounts for 5% of GNP and 37% of export revenues; world's largest exporter
    of beef and wool, second-largest for mutton, and among top wheat exporters;
    major crops - wheat, barley, sugarcane, fruit; livestock - cattle, sheep,
    poultry
Illicit drugs:
    Tasmania is one of the world's major suppliers of licit opiate products;
    government maintains strict controls over areas of opium poppy cultivation
    and output of poppy straw concentrate
