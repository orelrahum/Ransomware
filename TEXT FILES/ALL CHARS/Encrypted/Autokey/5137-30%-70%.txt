:Mongolia Economy

Overview:
    Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses of
    unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic activity
    traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock -
    Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world. In
    recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet
    support. The mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin,
    tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial production. Timber
    and fishing are also important sectors. In 1991-92 Mongolian leadership is
    struggling with severe economic dislocations, mainly attributable to the
    economic crumbling of the USSR, by far Mongolia's leading trade and
    development partner. Moscow almost certainly cut aid in 1991, and the
    dissolution of the USSR at yearend 1991 makes prospects for aid quite bleak
    for 1992. Industry in 1991-92 has been hit hard by energy shortages, mainly
    due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports.
    The government is moving away from the Soviet-style centrally planned
    economy through privatization and price reform.
