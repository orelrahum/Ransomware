:Mexico Economy

Overview:
    Mexico's economy is a mixture of state-owned industrial plants (notably
    oil), private manufacturing and services, and both large-scale and
    traditional agriculture. In the 1980s, Mexico experienced severe economic
    difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as world petroleum
    prices fell; rapid population growth outstripped the domestic food supply;
    and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate became more acute.
    Growth in national output, however, is recovering, rising from 1.4% in 1988
    to 4% in 1990 and again in 1991. The US is Mexico's major trading partner,
    accounting for two-thirds of its exports and imports. After petroleum,
    border assembly plants and tourism are the largest earners of foreign
    exchange. The government, in consultation with international economic
    agencies, is implementing programs to stabilize the economy and foster
    growth. In 1991 the government began negotiations with the US and Canada on
    a free trade agreement.

    islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade
    phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness
    of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development.
    Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the
    US pledged to spend $1 billion in the islands in the l990s. Geographical
    isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to
    long-term growth.

:Djibouti Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on service activities connected with the country's
    strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa.
    Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
    international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural
    resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent
    on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
    development projects. An unemployment rate of OOIF 30% HCIXZPIRL BB VI S
