:Indonesia Economy

Overview:
    Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
    planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise.
    Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly
    increasing population, it remains a poor country. GDP growth in 1985-91
    averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash
    underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the
    labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important
    sector, accounting for 23% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force. The
    staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia is
    now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and
    textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
    generation. Industrial output now accounts for 30% of GDP and is based on a
    supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas,
    timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates the external
    economy, generating more than 20% of the government's revenues and 40% of
    export earnings in 1989. However, the economy's growth is highly dependent
    on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan is Indonesia's most
    important customer and supplier of aid. In 1991, rapid growth in the money
    supply prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy, forcing the
    private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing. Real
    interest rates remained above 10%, off-shore commercial debt grew, and real
    GDP growth dropped slightly from the 7% of 1990.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $122 billion, per capita $630; real growth rate
    6.0% (1991 est.)

:Iran Economy

Overview:
    Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and
    other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private
    trading and service ventures. After a decade of economic decline, Iran's GNP
    grew roughly 4% in FY90 and 10% in FY91. An oil windfall in 1990 combined
    with a substantial increase in imports contributed to Iran's recent economic
    growth. Iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to
    reduce government intervention (including subsidies) and has allocated
    substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the
    economy. Nevertheless, lower oil revenues in 1991 - oil accounts for more
    than 90% of export revenues and provides roughly 65% of the financing for
    the five-year economic development plan - and dramatic increases in external
    debt are threatening development plans and could prompt Iran to cut imports,
    thus limiting economic growth in the medium term.
