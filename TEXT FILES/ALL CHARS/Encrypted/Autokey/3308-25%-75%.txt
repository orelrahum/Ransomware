    influx of tens of thousands of Croatian refugees. As in other former
    Communist areas in Eastern Europe, economic reform has often sputtered not
    only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of
    the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by
    rank-and-file people in the transition to a more market-oriented system. The
    key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not
    yet begun. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenia's
    comparatively well-educated work force, its developed infrastructure, and
    its Western business attitudes. Slovenia in absolute terms is a small
    economy, and a little Western investment would go a long way.
