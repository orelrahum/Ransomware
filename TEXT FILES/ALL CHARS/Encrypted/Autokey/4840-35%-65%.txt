    82,217,000 km2
Land area:
    82,217,000 km2; includes Baltic Sea, Black Sea, Caribbean Sea, Davis Strait,
    Denmark Strait, Drake Passage, Gulf of Mexico, Mediterranean Sea, North Sea,
    Norwegian Sea, Weddell Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Comparative area:
    slightly less than nine times the size of the US; second-largest of the
    world's four oceans (after the Pacific Ocean, but larger than Indian Ocean
    or Arctic Ocean)
Coastline:
    111,866 km
Disputes:
    some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
    tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of Africa near Cape
    Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea; hurricanes can occur from
    May to December, but are most frequent from August to November
Terrain:
    surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait, and
    Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise warm water gyre (broad, circular
    system of currents) in the north Atlantic, counterclockwise warm water gyre
    in the south Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Atlantic
    Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin;
    maximum depth is 8,605 meters in the Puerto Rico Trench
Natural resources:
    oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales), sand and gravel
    aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, precious stones
Environment:
    endangered marine species include the manatee, seals, sea lions, turtles,
    and whales; municipal sludge pollution off eastern US, southern Brazil, and
    eastern Argentina; oil pollution in Caribbean Sea, Gulf of Mexico, Lake
    Maracaibo, Mediterranean Sea, and North Sea; industrial waste and municipal
    sewage pollution in Baltic Sea, North Sea, and Mediterranean Sea; icebergs
    common in Davis Strait, Denmark Strait, and the northwestern Atlantic from
    February to August and have been spotted as far south as Bermuda and the
    Madeira Islands; icebergs from Antarctica occur in the extreme southern
    Atlantic
Note:
    ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north Atlantic from October
    to May and extreme south Atlantic from May to October; persistent fog can be
    a hazard to shipping from May to September; major choke points include the
    Dardanelles, Strait of Gibraltar, access to the Panama and Suez Canals;
    strategic straits include the Dover Strait, Straits of Florida, Mona
    Passage, The Sound (Oresund), and Windward Passage; north Atlantic shipping
    lanes subject to icebergs from February to August; the Equator divides the
    Atlantic Ocean into the North Atlantic Ocean and South Atlantic Ocean
    Kiel Canal and Saint Lawrence Seaway are two important waterways

:Atlantic Ocean Economy
