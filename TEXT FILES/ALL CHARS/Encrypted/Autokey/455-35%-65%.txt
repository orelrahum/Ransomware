Educators, critics, and others will want a layered structure--one that
defines or links paths through the layers to allow users to reach

aspects of network information.

Contending that information reuse constituted another significant issue,
LYNCH commended to the audience's attention Project NEEDS (i.e., National
Engineering Education Delivery System).  This project's objective is to
produce a database of engineering courseware EO WVPL SO XSP CGFWSPSZIG
