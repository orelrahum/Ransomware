Communists:
    PCE membership declined from a possible high of 160,000 in 1977 to roughly
    60,000 in 1987; the party gained almost 1 million voters and 10 deputies in
    the 1989 election; voters came mostly from the disgruntled socialist left;
    remaining strength is in labor, where it dominates the Workers Commissions
    trade union (one of the country's two major labor centrals), which claims a
    membership of about 1 million; experienced a modest recovery in 1986
    national election, nearly doubling the share of the vote it received in 1982
Other political or pressure groups:
    on the extreme left, the Basque Fatherland and Liberty (ETA) and the First
    of October Antifascist Resistance Group (GRAPO) use terrorism to oppose the
    government; free labor unions (authorized in April 1977) include the
    Communist-dominated Workers Commissions (CCOO); the Socialist General Union
    of Workers (UGT), and the smaller independent Workers Syndical Union (USO);
