:Nepal Economy

Overview:
    Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
    Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over
    90% of the population and accounting for 60% of GDP. Industrial activity is
    limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute,
    sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has
    expanded recently and accounted for 87% of foreign exchange earnings in
    FY89. Apart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable
    natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production
    in the late 1980s grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population
    growth of 2.6%. Forty percent or more of the population is undernourished
    partly because of poor distribution. Since May 1991, the government has been
    encouraging privatization and foreign investment. It has introduced policies
    to eliminate many business licenses and registration requirements in order
    to simplify domestic and foreign investment procedures. Economic prospects
    for the 1990s remain poor because the economy starts from such a low base.
