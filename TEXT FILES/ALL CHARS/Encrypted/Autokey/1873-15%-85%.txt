:El Salvador Economy

Overview:
    The agricultural sector accounts for 25% of GDP, employs about 40% of the
    labor force, and contributes about 66% to total exports. Coffee is the major
    commercial crop, accounting for 45% of export earnings. The manufacturing
    sector, based largely on food and beverage processing, accounts for 18% of
    GDP and 15% of employment. Economic losses because of guerrilla sabotage
    total more than $2 billion since 1979. The costs of maintaining a large
    military seriously constrain the government's efforts to provide essential
    social services. NeveJGLZPVLZ, KCSOLN ZB JTAQBAAE WIGPFH XNGCGJ NYM CKKPSS
