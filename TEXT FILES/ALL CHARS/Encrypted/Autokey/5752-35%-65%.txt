:Congo Economy

Overview:
    Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, a
    beginning industrial sector based largely on oil, supporting services, and a
    government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. A reform
    program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in
    1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and
    a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay
    of the economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and
    exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to
    finance large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5% annually,
    one of the highest rates in Africa. During the period 1987-91, however,
    growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5% annually, only half the
    population growth rate.

:Cook Islands Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are fruit,
    copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a
    fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic development
    is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack
    of natural resources and good transportation links. A large trade deficit is
    annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid.
    Current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
    and expanding the fishing industry.
