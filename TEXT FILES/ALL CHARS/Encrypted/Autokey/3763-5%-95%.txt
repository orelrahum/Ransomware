:Pacific Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
    particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides cheap
    sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing grounds,
    offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the
    construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish
    catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish
    catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and
    gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of
    Australia, New Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering
    offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil
    since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.
