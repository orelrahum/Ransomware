Overview:
    Petroleum production and processing account for about 80% of export
    receipts, 60% of government revenues, and 31% of GDP. Economic conditions
    have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of oil since 1985, for example,

    Gulf. A large share of exports is petrolIND DCSXGRKG PUFX XDOP MRGCDBQS
