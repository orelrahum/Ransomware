    The economy is essentially agricultural and centers on the traditional
    production of spices and tropical plants. Agriculture accounts for about 16%
    of GDP and 80% of exports and employs 24% of the labor force. Tourism is the
    leading foreign exchange earner, followed by agricultural exports.
    Manufacturing remains relatively undeveloped, but is expected to grow, given
    a more favorable private investment climate since 1983. Despite an
    impressive average annual growth rate for the economy of 5.5% during the
    period 1986-91, unemployment remains high at about 25%.
