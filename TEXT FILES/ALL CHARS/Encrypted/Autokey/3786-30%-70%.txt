:Singapore Economy

Overview:
    Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong service and
    manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links derived from
    its entrepot history. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the economy expanded
    rapidly, achieving an average annual growth rate of 9%. Per capita GDP is
    among the highest in Asia. The economy grew at a respectable 6.5% in 1991,
    down from 8.3% in 1990, in part because of a slowdown in overseas demand and
    lower growth in the financial and business services sector.
