:Maldives Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on fishing, tourism, and shipping. Agriculture is
    limited to the production of a few subsistence crops that provide only 10%
    of food requirements. Fishing is the largest industry, employing 25% of the
    work force and accounting for over 60% of exports; it is also an important
    source of government revenue. During the 1980s tourism has become one of the
    most important and highest growth sectors of the economy. In 1988 industry
    accounted for about 5% of GDP. Real GDP is officially estimated to have
    increased by about 10% annually during the period 1974-90.
