:Sri Lanka Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture, forestry, and fishing dominate the economy, employing half of
    the labor force and accounting for one quarter of GDP. The plantation crops
    of tea, rubber, and coconuts provide about one-third of export earnings. The
    economy has been plagued by high rates of unemployment since the late 1970s.
    Economic growth, which has been depressed by ethnic unrest, accelerated in
    1991 as domestic conditions began to improvQ.
