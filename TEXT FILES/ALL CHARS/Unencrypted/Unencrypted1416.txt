Overview:
    The economy is based primarily on agriculture, agro-based industry, and
    merchandising, with tourism and construction assuming increasing importance.
    Agriculture accounts for about 30% of GDP and provides 75% of export
    earnings, while sugar, the chief crop, accounts for almost 40% of hard
    currency earnings. The US, Belize's main trading partner, is assisting in
    efforts to reduce dependency on sugar with an agricultural diversification
    program.
