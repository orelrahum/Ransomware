Overview:
    In this small, open, tropical island economy, the tourist industry employs

    in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the
    government has moved to reduce the high dependence on tourism by promoting
    the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing.

:Sierra Leone Economy

Overview:
    The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed. Subsistence
    agriculture dominates the economy, generating about one-third of GDP and
    employing about two-thirds of the working population. Manufacturing, which
    accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw
    materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining
    provides an important source of hard currency. The economy suffers from high
    unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing
    dependency on foreign assistance. The government in 1990 was attempting to
    get the budget deficit under control and, in general, to bring economic
    policy in line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank. Since
    March 1991, however, military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and
    eastern Sierra Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined
    efforts to institute economic reforms.

:Singapore Economy

Overview:
    Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong service and
    manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links derived from
    its entrepot history. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the economy expanded
    rapidly, achieving an average annual growth rate of 9%. Per capita GDP is
    among the highest in Asia. The economy grew at a respectable 6.5% in 1991,
    down from 8.3% in 1990, in part because of a slowdown in overseas demand and
