:Vietnam Economy

Overview:
    This is a formerly centrally planned, developing economy with extensive
    government ownership and control of productive facilities. The economy is
    primarily agricultural; the sector employs about 70% of the labor force and
    accounts for half of GNP. Rice is the staple crop; substantial amounts of
    maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes are also grown. The government
    permits sale of surplus grain on the open market. Most of the mineral
    resources are located in the north, including coal, which is an important
    export item. Oil was discovered off the southern coast in 1986 with
    production reaching 70,000 barrels per day in 1991 and expected to increase
    in the years ahead. Following the end of the war in 1975, heavy-handed
    government measures undermined efforts at an efficient merger of the
    agricultural resources of the south and the industrial resources of the
    north. The economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received
    assistance from UN agencies, France, Australia, Sweden, and Communist
    countries. Inflation, although down from recent triple-digit levels, is
    still a major weakness and is showing signs of accelerating upwards again.
    Per capita output is among the world's lowest. Since late 1986 the
    government has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more
    economic activity over to the private sector.
