:Guinea-Bissau Economy

Overview:
    Guinea-Bissau ranks among the poorest countries in the world, with a per
    capita GDP below $200. Agriculture and fishing are the main economic
    activities. Cashew nuts, peanuts, and palm kernels are the primary exports.
    Exploitation of known mineral deposits is unlikely at present because of a
    weak infrastructure and the high cost of development. The government's
    four-year plan (1988-91) has targeted agricultural development as the top
    priority.
