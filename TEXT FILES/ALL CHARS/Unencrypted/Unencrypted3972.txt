:Jamaica Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on sugar, bauxite, and tourism. In 1985 it suffered a
    setback with the closure of some facilities in the bauxite and alumina
    industry, a major source of hard currency earnings. Since 1986 an economic
    recovery has been under way. In 1987 conditions began to improve for the
    bauxite and alumina industry because of increases in world metal prices. The
    recovery has also been supported by growth in the manufacturing and tourism
    sectors. In September 1988, Hurricane Gilbert inflicted severe damage on
    crops and the electric power system, a sharp but temporary setback to the
    economy. By October 1989 the economic recovery from the hurricane was
    largely complete, and real growth was up about 3% for 1989. In 1991,
    however, growth dropped to 1.0% as a result of the US recession, lower world
    bauxite prices, and monetary instability.

:Japan Economy

Overview:
    Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, and a comparatively
    small defense allocation have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
    rapidity, notably in high-technology fields. Industry, the most important
    sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
    fuels. Self-sufficent in rice, Japan must import 50% of its requirements for
    other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the world's largest
    fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global catch. Overall
    economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the 1960s, a 5%
    average in the 1970s and 1980s. A major contributor to overall growth of
    4.5% in 1991 was net exports, which cushioned the effect of slower growth in
    domestic demand. Inflation remains low at 3.3% and is easing due to lower
    oil prices and a stronger yen. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus,
    $80 billion in 1991, which supports extensive investment in foreign assets.
    The increased crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its
    population are two major long-run problems.

:Cambodia Economy

Overview:
    Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic development has been
    stymied by deadly political infighting. The economy is based on agriculture
    and related industries. Over the past decade Cambodia has been slowly
    recovering from its near destruction by war and political upheaval. The food
    situation remains precarious; during the 1980s famine was averted only
    through international relief. In 1986 the production level of rice, the
    staple food crop, was able to meet only 80% of domestic needs. The biggest
    success of the nation's recovery program has been in new rubber plantings
    and in fishing. Industry, other than rice processing, is almost nonexistent.
    Foreign trade has been primarily with the former USSR and Vietnam, and both
    trade and foreign aid are being adversely affected by the breakup of the
    USSR. Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and unreliable.
    Foreign aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has virtually stopped.

:Cameroon Economy

Overview:
    Because of its offshore oil resources, Cameroon has one of the highest
    incomes per capita in tropical Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious
    problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political
    instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate
    for business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led rapid
    economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986
    precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee,
    cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and
    inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-92, with support
    from the IMF and World Bank, the government has begun to introduce reforms
    designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture,
    and recapitalize the nation's banks. Nationwide strikes organized by
    opposition parties in 1991, however, undermined these efforts.
