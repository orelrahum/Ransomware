:South Africa Economy

Overview:
    Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population enjoy incomes,
    material comforts, and health and educational standards equal to those of
    Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from
    the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment, lack of job
    skills, and barriers to movement into higher-paying fields. Inputs and
    outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments, and
    the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international
    constraints on dealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy
    lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.
    Average growth of less than 2% in output in recent years falls far short of
    the 5% to 6% level needed to absorb some 300,000 new entrants to the labor
    force annually. Economic developments in the 1990s will be driven partly by
    the changing relations among the various ethnic groups.

:Spain Economy

Overview:
    Spain has done well since joining the EC in 1986. In accordance with its
    accession treaty, Spain has almost wholly liberalized trade and capital
    markets. Foreign and domestic investment has spurred average growth of 4%
    per year. Beginning in 1989, Madrid implemented a tight monetary policy to
    fight inflation - around 7% in 1989 and 1990. As a result growth slowed to
    2.5% in 1991. Spanish policymakers remain concerned with inflation - still
    hovering at 6%. Government officials also are worried about 16%
    unemployment, although many people listed as unemployed work in the
    underground economy. Spanish economists believe that structural adjustments
    due to the ongoing integration of the European market are likely to lead to
    more displaced workers.

:India Economy

Overview:
    India's economy is a mixture of traditional village farming and handicrafts,
    modern agriculture, old and new branches of industry, and a multitude of
    support services. It presents both the entrepreneurial skills and drives of
    the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the
    socialist mold. Growth of 4-5% annually in the 1980s has softened the impact
    of population growth on unemployment, social tranquility, and the
    environment. Agricultural output has continued to expand, reflecting the
    greater use of modern farming techniques and improved seed that have helped
    to make India self-sufficient in food grains and a net agricultural
    exporter. However, tens of millions of villagers, particularly in the south,
    have not benefited from the green revolution and live in abject poverty, and
    great numbers of urban residents lack the basic essentials of life. Industry
    has benefited from a partial liberalization of controls. The growth rate of
    the service sector has also been strong. India, however, has been challenged
    more recently by much lower foreign exchange reserves, higher inflation, and
    a large debt service burden.

    currents) in the south Indian Ocean; unique reversal of surface currents in
    the north Indian Ocean - low pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising,

:Indian Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Indian Ocean provides a major highway for the movement of petroleum
    products from the Middle East to Europe and North and South American
    countries. Fish from the ocean are of growing economic importance to many of
    the bordering countries as a source of both food and exports. Fishing fleets
    from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly
    for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the
    offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western Australia. An
    estimated 40% of the world's offshore oil production comes from the Indian
    Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are
    actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa,
    Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries:
    based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,
    minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel aggregates,
    placer deposits
