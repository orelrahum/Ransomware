:Zimbabwe Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and supplies almost 40%
    of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture and mining,
    produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP. Mining accounts for
    only 5% of both GDP and employment, but supplies of minerals and metals
    account for about 40% of exports. Wide year-to-year fluctuations in
    agricultural production over the past six years have resulted in an uneven
    growth rate, one that on average has matched the 3% annual increase in
    population. Helped by an IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program,
    output rose 3.5% in 1991. A drought beginning toward the end of 1991
    suggests rough going for 1992.
