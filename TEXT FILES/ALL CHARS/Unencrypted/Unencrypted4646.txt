Overview:
    In this small, open, tropical island economy, the tourist industry employs
    about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard currency
    earnings. In recent years the government has encouraged foreign investment
    in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, the
    government has moved to reduce the high dependence on tourism by promoting
    the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale manufacturing.
