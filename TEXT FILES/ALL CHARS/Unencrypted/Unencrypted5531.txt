:Egypt Economy

Overview:
    Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
    economies, most industrial plants being owned by the government.
    Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment.
    Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but
    in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
    debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
    balance-of-payments support. As part of the 1987 agreement with the IMF, the
    government agreed to institute a reform program to reduce inflation, promote
    economic growth, and improve its external position. The reforms have been
    slow in coming, however, and the economy has been largely stagnant for the
    past four years. The addition of 1 million people every seven months to
    Egypt's population exerts enormous pressure on the 5% of the total land area
    available for agriculture.

:El Salvador Economy

Overview:
    The agricultural sector accounts for 25% of GDP, employs about 40% of the
    labor force, and contributes about 66% to total exports. Coffee is the major
    commercial crop, accounting for 45% of export earnings. The manufacturing
    sector, based largely on food and beverage processing, accounts for 18% of
    GDP and 15% of employment. Economic losses because of guerrilla sabotage
    total more than $2 billion since 1979. The costs of maintaining a large
    military seriously constrain the government's efforts to provide essential
    social services. Nevertheless, growth in national output during the period
    1990-91 exceeded growth in population for the first time since 1987.
