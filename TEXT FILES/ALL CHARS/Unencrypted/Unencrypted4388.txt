:Burundi Economy

Overview:
    A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of economic
    development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
    industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which accounts
    for an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each year. The ability to
    pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
    climate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic reform
    agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi
    is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability and attract foreign
    investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee companies were privatized
    via public auction in September 1991.
