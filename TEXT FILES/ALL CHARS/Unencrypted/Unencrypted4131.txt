:Venezuela Economy

Overview:
    Petroleum is the cornerstone of the economy and accounted for 23% of GDP,
    80% of central government revenues, and 80% of export earnings in 1991.
    President PEREZ introduced an economic readjustment program when he assumed
    office in February 1989. Lower tariffs and price supports, a free market
    exchange rate, and market-linked interest rates threw the economy into
    confusion, causing an 8% decline in GDP in 1989. However, the economy
    recovered part way in 1990, and grew by 9.2% in 1991, led by the petroleum
    sector.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $52.3 billion, per capita $2,590; real growth
    rate 9.2% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    30.7% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    9.3% (1991 est.)
Budget:
    revenues $13.2 billion; expenditures $13.1 billion, including capital
    expenditures of $NA (1991)
Exports:
    $15.1 billion (f.o.b., 1991 est.)
  commodities:
    petroleum 80%, bauxite and aluminum, iron ore, agricultural products, basic
    manufactures
