    27 to 29 December 1990, the Central Committee of the National Party of Unity
    and Progress (UPRONA) replaced the Military Committee for National
    Salvation, and became the supreme governing body during the transition to
    constitutional government
Judicial branch:
    Supreme Court (Cour Supreme)
Leaders:
  Chief of State:
    Major Pierre BUYOYA, President (since 9 September 1987)
  Head of Government:
    Prime Minister Adrien SIBOMANA (since 26 October 1988)
Political parties and leaders:
    only party - National Party of Unity and Progress (UPRONA), Nicolas MAYUGI,
    secretary general; note - although Burundi is still officially a one-party
    state, at least four political parties were formed in 1991 in anticipation
    of proposed constitutional reform in 1992 - Burundi Democratic Front
    (FRODEBU), Organization of the People of Burundi (RPB), Socialist Party of
    Burundi (PSB), Movement for Peace and Democracy (MPD) - the Party for the
    Liberation of the Hutu People (PALIPEHUTU), formed in exile in the early
    1980s, is an ethnically based political party dedicated to majority rule;
    the government has long accused PALIPEHUTU of practicing devisive ethnic
    politics and fomenting violence against the state. PALIPEHUTU's exclusivist
    charter makes it an unlikely candidate for legalization under the new
    constitution that will require party membership open to all ethnic groups
