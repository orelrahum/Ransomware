    surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise, warm-water gyre
    (broad, circular system of currents) and in the southern Pacific by a
    counterclockwise, cool-water gyre; sea ice occurs in the Bering Sea and Sea
    of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from Antarctica
    in October; the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East
    Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches; the
    world's greatest depth is 10,924 meters in the Marianas Trench
Natural resources:
    oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
    deposits, fish
Environment:
    endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals,
    turtles, and whales; oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea;
    dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the
    southwestern Pacific Ocean; subject to tropical cyclones (typhoons) in
    southeast and east Asia from May to December (most frequent from July to
    October); tropical cyclones (hurricanes) may form south of Mexico and strike
    Central America and Mexico from June to October (most common in August and
    September); southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica;
    occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade
    winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, killing
    the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies; consequently,
    the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds
    to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source
Note:
    the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,
    and the Singapore Strait; the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the
    North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean; ships subject to
    superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme
    south from May to October; persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June
    to December is a hazard to shipping; surrounded by a zone of violent
    volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring
    of Fire

:Pacific Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
    particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides cheap
    sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing grounds,
    offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the
    construction industry. In 1985 over half (54%) of the world's total fish
    catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish
    catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and
    gas reserves is playing an ever-increasing role in the energy supplies of
    Australia, New Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering
    offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil
    since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.
Industries:
    fishing, oil and gas production
