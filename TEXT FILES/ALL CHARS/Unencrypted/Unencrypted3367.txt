:Spratly Islands Economy

Overview:
    Economic activity is limited to commercial fishing, proximity to nearby oil-
    and gas-producing sedimentary basins suggests the potential for oil and gas
    deposits, but the Spratlys region is largely unexplored, and there are no
    reliable estimates of potential reserves; commercial exploitation has yet to
    be developed.
Industries:
    none
