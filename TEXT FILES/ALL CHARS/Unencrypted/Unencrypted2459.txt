    Up to the invasion by Iraq in August 1990, the oil sector had dominated the
    economy. Kuwait has the third-largest oil reserves in the world after Saudi
    Arabia and Iraq. Earnings from hydrocarbons have generated over 90% of both
    export and government revenues and contributed about 40% to GDP. Most of the
    nonoil sector has traditionally been dependent upon oil-derived government
    revenues. Iraq's destruction of Kuwait's oil industry during the Gulf war
    has devastated the economy. Iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80% of
    Kuwait's 950 operating oil wells, as well as sabotaged key surface
    facilities. Firefighters brought all of the roughly 750 oil well fires and
    blowouts under control by November 1991. By yearend, production had been
    brought back to 400,000 barrels per day; it could take two to three years to
    restore Kuwait's oil production to its prewar level of about 2.0 million
    barrels per day. Meanwhile, population had been greatly reduced because of
    the war, from 2.1 million to 1.4 million.
