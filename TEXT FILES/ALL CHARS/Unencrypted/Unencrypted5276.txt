:Barbados Economy

Overview:
    A per capita income of $6,500 gives Barbados one of the highest standards of
    living of all the small island states of the eastern Caribbean.
    Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation of sugarcane and
    related activities. In recent years, however, the economy has diversified
    into manufacturing and tourism. The tourist industry is now a major employer
    of the labor force and a primary source of foreign exchange. The economy
    slowed in 1990-91, however, and Bridgetown's declining hard currency
    reserves and inability to finance its deficits have caused it to adopt an
    austere economic reform program.
