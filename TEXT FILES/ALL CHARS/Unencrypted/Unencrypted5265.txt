disclaims most of our liability to you.  It also tells you how
you can distribute copies of this etext if you want to.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERG-TM ETEXTS

This PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association (the
"Project").  Among other things, this means that no one owns a
United States copyright on or for this work, so the Project (and
you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special
rules, set forth below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute
this etext under the Project's "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable efforts
to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain works.
Despite these efforts, the Project's etexts and any medium they
may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other things, Defects
may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data,
transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property
infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other etext medium,
a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be
read by your equipment.

[1] the Project (and any other party you may receive this etext
from as a PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm etext) disclaims all liability to
you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees, and
[2] YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE OR UNDER STRICT LIABILI-
TY, OR FOR BREACH OF WARRANTY OR CONTRACT, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES, EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

If you discover a Defect in this etext within 90 days of
receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you
paid for it by sending an explanatory note within that time to
the person you received it from.  If you received it on a
physical medium, you must return it with your note, and such
person may choose to alternatively give you a replacement copy.
If you received it electronically, such person may choose to
alternatively give you a second opportunity to receive it elec-
tronically.

the exclusion or limitation of consequential damages, so the
above disclaimers and exclusions may not apply to you, and you

:Afghanistan Economy

Overview:
    Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly
    dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and
    goats). Economic considerations, however, have played second fiddle to
    political and military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including
    the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February
    1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population fled the country,
    with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3
    million. Another 1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within
    Afghanistan. Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product
    is lower than 12 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the
    disruption of trade and transport.

    exchange rate conversion - $3 billion, per capita $200; real growth rate 0%
    (1989 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):

  commodities:
    food and petroleum products
  partners:
    mostly former USSR
External debt:
    $2.3 billion (March 1991 est.)
Industrial production:
    growth rate 2.3% (FY91 est.); accounts for about 25% of GDP
Electricity:
    480,000 kW capacity; 1,450 million kWh produced, 90 kWh per capita (1991)
Industries:
    small-scale production of textiles, soap, furniture, shoes, fertilizer, and
    cement; handwoven carpets; natural gas, oil, coal, copper

    largely subsistence farming and nomadic animal husbandry; cash products -
    wheat, fruits, nuts, karakul pelts, wool, mutton
Illicit drugs:
    an illicit producer of opium poppy and cannabis for the international drug
    trade; world's second-largest opium producer (after Burma) and a major
    source of hashish

    US commitments, including Ex-Im (FY70-89), $380 million; Western (non-US)
    countries, ODA and OOF bilateral commitments (1970-89), $510 million; OPEC
