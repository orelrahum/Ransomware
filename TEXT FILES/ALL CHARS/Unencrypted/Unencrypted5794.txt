    Lebanon. Israel arms and trains the Army of South Lebanon (ASL), which also
    occupies the security zone and is Israel's first line of defense against
    attacks on its northern border. The following description is based on the
    present constitutional and customary practices of the Lebanese system.

:Lebanon Economy

Overview:
    Since 1975 civil war has seriously damaged Lebanon's economic
    infrastructure, cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's
    position as a Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. Following October
    1990, however, a tentative peace has enabled the central government to begin
    restoring control in Beirut, collect taxes, and regain access to key port
    and government facilities. The battered economy has also been propped up by
    a financially sound banking system and resilient small- and medium-scale
    manufacturers. Family remittances, banking transactions, manufactured and
    farm exports, the narcotics trade, and international emergency aid are main
    sources of foreign exchange. In the relatively settled year of 1991,
    industrial production, agricultural output, and exports showed substantial
    gains. The further rebuilding of the war-ravaged country could provide a
    major stimulus to the economy in 1992, provided that the political and
    military situation remains reasonably calm.

:Lesotho Economy

Overview:
    Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
    resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light
    manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa ($153
    million in 1989). The great majority of households gain their livelihoods
    from subsistence farming and migrant labor. Manufacturing depends largely on
    farm products to support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries;
    other industries include textile, clothing, and light engineering.
    Industry's share of GDP rose from 6% in 1982 to 15% in 1989. Political and
    economic instability in South Africa raises uncertainty for Lesotho's
    economy, especially with respect to migrant worker remittances - typically
    about 40% of GDP.

:Liberia Economy

Overview:
    Civil war during 1990 destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the
    infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Expatriate businessmen fled the
    country, taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return.
    Richly endowed with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate
    favorable to agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic
    products, while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in
    scope. Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction
    and repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who fled to neighboring
    countries. In 1991, the political impasse between the interim government and
    the rebel leader Charles Taylor prevented restoration of normal economic
    life.
