:Suriname Economy

Overview:
    The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts for about
    70% of export earnings and 40% of tax revenues. The economy has been in
    trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world
    bauxite prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until late 1986
    was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in the interior that
    crippled the important bauxite sector. Although the insurgency has since
    ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered, a military coup in December 1990
    reflected continued political instability and deterred investment and
    economic reform. High inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market
    activity, and hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.
