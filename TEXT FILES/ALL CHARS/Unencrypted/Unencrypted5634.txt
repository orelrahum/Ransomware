:Uruguay Economy

Overview:
    The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession of the early 1980s.
    In 1988 real GDP grew by only 0.5% and in 1989 by 1.5%. The recovery was led
    by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors, agriculture alone
    contributing 20% to GDP, employing about 11% of the labor force, and
    generating a large proportion of export earnings. Raising livestock,
    particularly cattle and sheep, is the major agricultural activity. In 1991,
    domestic growth improved somewhat over 1990, but various government factors,
    including concentration on the external sector, adverse weather conditions,
    and greater attention to bringing down inflation and reducing the fiscal
    deficit kept output from expanding rapidly. In a major step toward greater
    regional economic cooperation, Uruguay joined Brazil, Argentina, and
    Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market (Mercosur). President
    LACALLE continues to press ahead with a broad economic reform plan to reduce
    state intervention in the economy, but he faces strong opposition.

:Uzbekistan Economy

Overview:
    Although Uzbekistan accounted for only 3.4% of total Soviet output, it
    produced two-thirds of the USSR's cotton. Moscow's push for ever-increasing
    amounts of cotton included massive irrigation projects which caused
    extensive environmental damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic.
    Furthermore, the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive
    pollution and widespread health problems. Recently the republic has sought
    to encourage food production at the expense of cotton. The small industrial
    sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery, mineral
    fertilizers, vegetable oil, and electrical cranes. Uzbekistan also has some
    important natural resources including gold (about 30% of Soviet production),
    uranium, and natural gas. The Uzbek government has encouraged land reform
    but has shied away from other aspects of economic reform.
