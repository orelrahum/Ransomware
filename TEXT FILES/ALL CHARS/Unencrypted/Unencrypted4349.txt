:Australia Economy

Overview:
    Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a per
    capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European countries.
    Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural
    products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Of the top 25 exports, 21 are
    primary products, so that, as happened during 1983-84, a downturn in world
    commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy. The government is
    pushing for increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
    international markets continues to be severe.

    purchasing power equivalent - $280.8 billion, per capita $16,200; real
    growth rate --0.6% (1991 est.)

  partners:

    Kong
Imports:
