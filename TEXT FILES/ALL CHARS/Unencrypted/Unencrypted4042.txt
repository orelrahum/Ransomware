:West Bank Header

Note:
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
    Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the
    West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank
    describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian
    administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, with respect to
    negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, it is US policy that a
    distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank
    because of the city's special status and circumstances. Therefore, a
    negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in
    character from that of the rest of the West Bank.

:West Bank Economy

Overview:
    Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military
    administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising (intifadah).
    Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have
    been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli
    policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not
    productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli
    industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers
    employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states, but such transfers from the Gulf
    dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake
    of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West
    Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have plunged because of
    the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to
    curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living
    standards. The area's economic outlook remains bleak.

    construction of the first international hotel is under way.

:World Economy

Overview:
    Aggregate world output in 1991 increased by 1.3%, in contrast to estimated
    2% growth in 1990 and 3% growth in 1989. In 1991, the developed countries
    grew by 2.5% and the LDCs by 3.5%, these gains being offset by a 10-15% drop
    in the former Communist-dominated areas of the USSR and Eastern Europe. As
    usual, results among individual countries differed widely. In the developed
    group, Japan led with 4.5%, the West European members averaged 1.2%, and the
    recession-plagued United States lagged,with GDP down 0.7%. As for the 15
    former Soviet republics and the seven nations of Eastern Europe, output
    plummeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the
    rules of the game and in the channels of production and exchange. China and
    the Four Dragons performed well in 1991 but many of the other developing
    countries are mired in poverty and political instability. For the world as a
    whole, the addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already
    overcrowded globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution,
    desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine.

    computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical
    equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a small
    portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
    technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial
    nations and the less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid
    development of new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating
    already grim environmental problems

:Kuwait Economy

Overview:
    Up to the invasion by Iraq in August 1990, the oil sector had dominated the
    economy. Kuwait has the third-largest oil reserves in the world after Saudi
    Arabia and Iraq. Earnings from hydrocarbons have generated over 90% of both
    export and government revenues and contributed about 40% to GDP. Most of the
    nonoil sector has traditionally been dependent upon oil-derived government
    revenues. Iraq's destruction of Kuwait's oil industry during the Gulf war
    has devastated the economy. Iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80% of
    Kuwait's 950 operating oil wells, as well as sabotaged key surface
    facilities. Firefighters brought all of the roughly 750 oil well fires and
    blowouts under control by November 1991. By yearend, production had been
    brought back to 400,000 barrels per day; it could take two to three years to
    restore Kuwait's oil production to its prewar level of about 2.0 million
    barrels per day. Meanwhile, population had been greatly reduced because of
    the war, from 2.1 million to 1.4 million.
