:Sudan Economy

Overview:
    Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse
    weather, high inflation, and counterproductive economic policies. The
    economy is dominated by governmental entities that account for more than 70%
    of new investment. The private sector's main areas of activity are
    agriculture and trading, with most private industrial investment predating
    1980. The economy's base is agriculture, which employs 80% of the work
    force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items. Sluggish economic
    performance over the past decade, attributable largely to declining annual
    rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita income and consumption. A high
