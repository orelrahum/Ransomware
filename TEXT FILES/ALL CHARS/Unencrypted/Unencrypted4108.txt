:South Africa Economy

Overview:
    Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population enjoy incomes,
    material comforts, and health and educational standards equal to those of
    Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from
    the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment, lack of job
    skills, and barriers to movement into higher-paying fields. Inputs and
    outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments, and
    the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international
    constraints on dealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy
    lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide two-thirds of exports.
    Average growth of less than 2% in output in recent years falls far short of
    the 5% to 6% level needed to absorb some 300,000 new entrants to the labor
    force annually. Economic developments in the 1990s will be driven partly by
    the changing relations among the various ethnic groups.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $104 billion, per capita $2,600; real growth rate
    - 0.5% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    15.7% (March 1992)
Unemployment rate:

Budget:
    revenues $29.4 billion; expenditures $35.0 billion, including capital
    expenditures of $1.1 billion (FY93 est.)
Exports:
    $24.0 billion (f.o.b., 1991)
  commodities:
    gold 25-30%, minerals and metals 20-25%, food 5%, chemicals 3%
