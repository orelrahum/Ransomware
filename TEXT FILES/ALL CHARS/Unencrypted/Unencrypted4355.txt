:The Bahamas Economy

Overview:
    The Bahamas is a stable, middle-income developing nation whose economy is
    based primarily on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism alone provides
    about 50% of GDP and directly or indirectly employs about 50,000 people or
    40% of the local work force. The economy has slackened in recent years, as
    the annual increase in the number of tourists slowed. Nonetheless, the per
    capita GDP of $9,900 is one of the highest in the region.
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent--$2.5 billion, per capita $9,900; real growth
