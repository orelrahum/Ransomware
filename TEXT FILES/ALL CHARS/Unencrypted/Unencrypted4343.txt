:Argentina Economy

Overview:
    Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate population,
    an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.
    Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist policies, the
    economy has encountered major problems in recent years, leading to
    escalating inflation and a recession during 1988-90. Since 1978, Argentina's
    external debt has nearly doubled to $58 billion, creating severe debt
    servicing difficulties and hurting the country's creditworthiness with
    international lenders. Elected in 1989, President Menem has implemented a
    comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of reversing
    Argentina's economic decline and putting it on a path of stable, sustainable
    growth.
