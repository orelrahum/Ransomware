Political parties and leaders:

    state, at least four political parties were formed in 1991 in anticipation
    of proposed constitutional reform in 1992 - Burundi Democratic Front
    (FRODEBU), Organization of the People of Burundi (RPB), Socialist Party of
    Burundi (PSB), Movement for Peace and Democracy (MPD) - the Party for the
    Liberation of the Hutu People (PALIPEHUTU), formed in exile in the early
    1980s, is an ethnically based political party dedicated to majority rule;
    the government has long accused PALIPEHUTU of practicing devisive ethnic
    politics and fomenting violence against the state. PALIPEHUTU's exclusivist
    charter makes it an unlikely candidate for legalization under the new
    constitution that will require party membership open to all ethnic groups

:Burundi Economy

Overview:
    A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of economic
    development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
    industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which accounts
    for an average 90% of foreign exchange earnings each year. The ability to
    pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
    climate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic reform
    agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi
    is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability and attract foreign
    investment in industry. Several state-owned coffee companies were privatized
    via public auction in September 1991.

:Cambodia Economy

Overview:
    Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic development has been
    stymied by deadly political infighting. The economy is based on agriculture
    and related industries. Over the past decade Cambodia has been slowly
    recovering from its near destruction by war and political upheaval. The food
    situation remains precarious; during the 1980s famine was averted only
    through international relief. In 1986 the production level of rice, the
    staple food crop, was able to meet only 80% of domestic needs. The biggest
    success of the nation's recovery program has been in new rubber plantings
    and in fishing. Industry, other than rice processing, is almost nonexistent.
    Foreign trade has been primarily with the former USSR and Vietnam, and both
    trade and foreign aid are being adversely affected by the breakup of the
    USSR. Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and unreliable.
    Foreign aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has virtually stopped.
