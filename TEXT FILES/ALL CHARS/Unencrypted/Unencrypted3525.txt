:Tonga Economy

Overview:
    The economy's base is agriculture, which employs about 70% of the labor
    force and contributes 50% to GDP. Coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans are
    the main crops and make up two-thirds of exports. The country must import a
    high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The manufacturing
    sector accounts for only 11% of GDP. Tourism is the primary source of hard
    currency earnings, but the island remains dependent on sizable external aid
    and remittances to offset its trade deficit.
