    The economy is based largely on tourism (including gambling) and textile and
    fireworks manufacturing. Efforts to diversify have spawned other small
    industries - toys, artificial flowers, and electronics. The tourist sector
    has accounted for roughly 25% of GDP, and the clothing industry has provided
    about two-thirds of export earnings; the gambling industry represented 36%
    of GDP in 1991. Macau depends on China for most of its food, fresh water,
    and energy imports. Japan and Hong Kong are the main suppliers of raw
    materials and capital goods.
