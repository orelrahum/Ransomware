:Laos Economy

Overview:
    One of the world's poorest nations, Laos has had a Communist centrally
    planned economy with government ownership and control of productive
    enterprises of any size. In recent years, however, the government has been
    decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a
    landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure; that is, it has no
    railroads, a rudimentary road system, limited external and internal
    telecommunications, and electricity available in only a limited area.
    Subsistence agriculture is the main occupation, accounting for over 60% of
    GDP and providing about 85-90% of total employment. The predominant crop is
    rice. For the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend for its
    survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources; aid
    from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $800 million, per capita $200; real growth rate
    4% (1991)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    10.4% (December 1991)
Unemployment rate:
    21% (1989 est.)
Budget:
    revenues $83 million; expenditures $188.5 million, including capital
    expenditures of $94 million (1990 est.)
Exports:
    $72 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    electricity, wood products, coffee, tin
