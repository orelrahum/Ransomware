:Ukraine Economy

Overview:
    Because of its size, geographic location, Slavic population, and rich
    resources, the loss of Ukraine was the final and most bitter blow to the
    Soviet leaders wishing to preserve some semblance of the old political,
    military, and economic power of the USSR. After Russia, the Ukrainian
    republic was far and away the most important economic component of the
    former Soviet Union producing more than three times the output of the
    next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth
    of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities
    of meat, milk, grain and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its
    well-developed and diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw
    materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the USSR. In
    early 1992 the continued wholesale disruption of economic ties and the lack
    of an institutional structure necessary to formulate and implement economic
    reforms preclude a near-term recovery of output.
