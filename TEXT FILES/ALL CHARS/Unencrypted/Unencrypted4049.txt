:Liechtenstein Economy

Overview:
    The prosperous economy is based primarily on small-scale light industry and
    tourism. Industry accounts for 53% of total employment, the service sector
    45% (mostly based on tourism), and agriculture and forestry 2%. The sale of
    postage stamps to collectors is estimated at $10 million annually. Low
    business taxes (the maximum tax rate is 20%) and easy incorporation rules
    have induced about 25,000 holding or so-called letter box companies to
    establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated
    solely for tax purposes, provide 30% of state revenues. The economy is tied
    closely to that of Switzerland in a customs union, and incomes and living
    standards parallel those of the more prosperous Swiss groups.
