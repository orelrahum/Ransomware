:Bangladesh Economy

Overview:
    Bangladesh is one of the poorest nations in the world. The economy is based
    on the output of a narrow range of agricultural products, such as jute,
    which is the main cash crop and major source of export earnings, and rice.
    Bangladesh is hampered by a relative lack of natural resources, population
    growth of more than 2% a year, large-scale unemployment, and a limited
    infrastructure; furthermore, it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters.
    Despite these constraints, real GDP growth averaged about 3.5% annually
    during 1985-89. A strong agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth
    rate up to 6.2%, and FY91 saw further, though smaller, increases in output.
    Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the government's
    development strategy.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $23.1 billion, per capita $200; real growth rate
    3.2% (FY91)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
