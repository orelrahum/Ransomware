:Comoros Economy

Overview:
    One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of several islands
    that have poor transportation links, a young and rapidly increasing
    population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the
    labor force contributes to a low level of economic activity, high
    unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical
    assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the
    leading sector of the economy. It contributes about 34% to GDP, employs 80%
    of the labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not
    self-sufficient in food production, and rice, the main staple, accounts for
    90% of imports. During the period 1982-86 the industrial sector grew at an
    annual average rate of 5.3%, but its contribution to GDP was only 5% in
    1988. Despite major investment in the tourist industry, which accounts for
    about 25% of GDP, growth has stagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of
    1.5% during 1985-90 has led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and
    balance-of-payments difficulties. Preliminary estimates for 1991 show a
    moderate increase in the growth rate based on increased exports, tourism,
    and government investment outlays.

:Congo Economy

Overview:
    Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, a
    beginning industrial sector based largely on oil, supporting services, and a
    government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. A reform
    program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in
    1990-91 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and
    a heavy debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay
    of the economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and
    exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to
    finance large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5% annually,
    one of the highest rates in Africa. During the period 1987-91, however,
    growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5% annually, only half the
    population growth rate.

:Cook Islands Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are fruit,
    copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a
    fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic development
    is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack
    of natural resources and good transportation links. A large trade deficit is
    annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid.
    Current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
    and expanding the fishing industry.

:Andorra Economy

Overview:
    The mainstay of Andorra's economy is tourism. An estimated 13 million
    tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's duty-free status and by its
    summer and winter resorts. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
    of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock
    activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes,
    cigars, and furniture. The rapid pace of European economic integration is a
    potential threat to Andorra's advantages from its duty-free status.
