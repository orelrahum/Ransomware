:Saint Pierre and Miquelon Economy

Overview:
    The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by
    servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of Newfoundland. The
    economy has been declining, however, because the number of ships stopping at
    Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years. In March 1989, an
    agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pierre's
    trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadian-claimed waters for three years.
    The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish
    exports to a halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports
    come primarily from Canada and France.
