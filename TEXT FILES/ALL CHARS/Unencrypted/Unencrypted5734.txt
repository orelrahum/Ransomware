:Belarus Economy

Overview:
    In many ways Belarus resembles the three Baltic states, for example, in its
    industrial competence, its higher-than-average standard of living, and its
    critical dependence on the other former Soviet states for fuels and raw
    materials. Belarus ranks fourth in gross output among the former Soviet
    republics, producing 4% of the total GDP and employing 4% of the labor
    force. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now supplies important producer
    and consumer goods - sometimes as the sole producer - to the other states.
    The soil in Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by
    emphasizing favorable crops and livestock (especially pigs and chickens),
    Belarus has become a net exporter to the other republics of meat, milk,
    eggs, flour, and potatoes. Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and
    gas and receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil
    pipeline and the Northern Lights gas pipeline. These pipelines transit
    Belarus enroute to Eastern Europe. Belarus produces petrochemicals,
    plastics, synthetic fibers (nearly 30% of former Soviet output), and
    fertilizer (20% of former Soviet output). Raw material resources are limited
    to potash and peat deposits. The peat (more than one-third of the total for
    the former Soviet Union) is used in domestic heating as boiler fuel for
    electric power stations and in the production of chemicals. The potash
    supports fertilizer production.

:Belgium Economy

Overview:
    This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its central
    geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified
    industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in the
    populous Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging
    reinvestment in the southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources
    Belgium must import essential raw materials, making its economy closely
    dependent on the state of world markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC
    countries. During the period 1988-90, Belgium's economic performance was
    marked by 4% average growth, moderate inflation, and a substantial external
    surplus. Growth fell to 1.4% in 1991.
