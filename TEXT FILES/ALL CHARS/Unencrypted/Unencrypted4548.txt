:Madagascar Economy

Overview:
    Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. Agriculture,
    including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting
    for over 40% of GDP, employing about 80% of the labor force, and
    contributing to more than 70% of total export earnings. Industry is largely
    confined to the processing of agricultural products and textile
    manufacturing; in 1990 it accounted for only 16% of GDP and employed almost
    5% of the labor force. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year
    development plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by
    1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After
    mid-1991, however, output dropped sharply because of protracted
    antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political reform.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $2.4 billion, per capita $200; real growth rate
    -3.8% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    10% (1991)
Unemployment rate:
    NA%
Budget:
    revenues $390 million; expenditures $525 million, including capital
    expenditures of $240 million (1990 est.)
Exports:
    $290 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    coffee 45%, vanilla 15%, cloves 11%, sugar, petroleum products
  partners:
    France, Japan, Italy, Germany, US
Imports:
    $436 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)
