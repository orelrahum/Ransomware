Overview:
    The economy is dependent on agriculture and thus is highly vulnerable to
    climatic conditions. Agriculture accounts for about 30% of GDP and employs
    40% of the labor force. Principal products include bananas, citrus, mangoes,
    root crops, and coconuts. In 1990, GDP grew by 7%, bouncing back from the
    1.6% decline of 1989. The tourist industry remains undeveloped because of a
    rugged coastline and the lack of an international airport.
