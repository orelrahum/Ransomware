:Hong Kong Economy

Overview:
    Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or nontariff
    barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be
    imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18 of GDP, employs 28 of the
    labor force, and exports about 90 of its output. Real GDP growth averaged a
    remarkable 8 in 198788, then slowed to 2.53.0 in 198990. Unemployment,
    which has been declining since the mid1980s, is now about 2. A shortage of
    labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of living.
    Shortterm prospects remain solid so long as major trading partners continue
    to be reasonably prosperous. The crackdown in China in 198991 casts a
    shadow over the longer term economic outlook.
