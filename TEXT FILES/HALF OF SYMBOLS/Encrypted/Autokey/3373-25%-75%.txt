      No articles will be removed from the journal.  Because there are
     no back issues, there are no lost issues either.  Once a subscriber
     logs onto the journal he or she has access not only to the currently
     published materials, but retrospectively to everything that has been
     published in it.  Thus the table of contents grows bigger.  The date
     of publication serves to distinguish between currently published
     materials and older materials.

      The pricing system for the journal resembles that for most medical
     journals:  for 1992, 95 for a year, plus telecommunications charges
     there are no connect time charges    for 1993, 110 for the
     entire year for single users, though the journal can be put on a
     local area network LAN.  However, only one person can access the
     journal at a time.  Site licenses may come in the future.
