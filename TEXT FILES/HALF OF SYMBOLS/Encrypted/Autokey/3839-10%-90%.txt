For sin, on war and mutual slaughter bent.
Forthwith from council to the work they flew
None arguing stood innumerable hands
Were ready in a moment up they turned
Wide the celestial soil, and saw beneath
The originals of nature in their crude
Conception sulphurous and nitrous foam
They found, they mingled, and, with subtle art,
Concocted and adusted they reduced
To blackest grain, and into store conveyed:
Part hidden veins digged up nor hath this earth
Entrails unlike of mineral and stone,
Whereof to found their engines and their balls
Of missive ruin part incentive reed
Provide, pernicious with one touch to fire.
