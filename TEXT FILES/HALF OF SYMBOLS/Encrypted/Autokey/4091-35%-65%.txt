And, to the faithful, death the gate of life
Taught this by his example, whom I now
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.
To whom thus also the Angel last replied.
This having learned, thou hast attained the sum
Of wisdom hope no higher, though all the stars
Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers,
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea,
And all the riches of this world enjoyedst,
And all the rule, one empire only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith,
Add virtue, patience, temperance add love,
By name to come called charity, the soul
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
A Paradise within thee, happier far.
Let us descend now therefore from this top
Of speculation for the hour precise
Exacts our parting heVPK HRQ UIE!GKW KYTYHY,
