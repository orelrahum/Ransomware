Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.
To whom thus also the Angel last replied.
This having learned, thou hast attained the sum
Of wisdom hope no higher, though all the stars
Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers,
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea,
And all the riches of this world enjoyedst,
And all the rule, one empire only add
Deeds to thy knowledge answerable add faith,
Add virtue, patience, temperance add love,
By name to come called charity, the soul
Of all the rest: then wilt thou not be loth
To leave this Paradise, but shalt possess
A Paradise within thee, happier far.
Let us descend now therefore from this top
Of speculation for the hour precise
Exacts our parting hence and see!the guards,
By me encamped on yonder hill, expect
Their motion at whose front a flaming sword,
In signal of remove, waves fiercely round:
We may no longer stay: go, waken Eve
Her also I with gentle dreams have calmed
Portending good, and all her spirits composed
To meek submission: thou, at season fit,
Let her with thee partake what thou hast heard
Chiefly what may concern her faith to know,
The great deliverance by her seed to come
For by the Womans seed on all mankind:
That ye may live, which will be many days,
Both in one faith unanimous, though sad,
With cause, for evils past yet much more cheered
With meditation on the happy end.
He ended, and they both descend the hill
Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve
Lay sleeping, ran before but found her waked
And thus with words not sad she him received.
Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know
For God is also in sleep and dreams advise,
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good
Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress
Wearied I fell asleep:  But now lead on
In me is no delay with thee to go,
Is to stay here without thee here to stay,
Is to go hence unwilling thou to me
Art all things under Heaven, all places thou,
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.
This further consolation yet secure
I carry hence though all by me is lost,
Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.
So spake our mother Eve and Adam heard
Well pleased, but answered not:  For now, too nigh
The ArchAngel stood and, from the other hill
To their fixed station, all in bright array
The Cherubim descended on the ground
Gliding meteorous, as eveningmist
Risen from a river oer the marish glides,
