dont think

  Then you shouldnt talk, said the Hatter.

  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got
up in great disgust, and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep
instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her
going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that
they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

  At any rate Ill never go THERE again! said Alice as she
picked her way through the wood.  Its the stupidest teaparty I
ever was at in all my life!

  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a
door leading right into it.  Thats very curious! she thought.
But everythings curious today.  I think I may as well go in at
once.  And in she went.

  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the
little glass table.  Now, Ill manage better this time, she
said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and
unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to
work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her
pocked till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the
little passage:  and THENshe found herself at last in the
beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds and the cool
fountains.



                          CHAPTER VIII

                   The Queens CroquetGround


  A large rosetree stood near the entrance of the garden:  the
roses growing on it were white, but there were three gardeners at
it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious
thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up
to them she heard one of them say, Look out now, Five!  Dont go
splashing paint over me like that!

  I couldnt help it, said Five, in a sulky tone Seven jogged
my elbow.

  On which Seven looked up and said, Thats right, Five!  Always
lay the blame on others!

  YOUD better not talk! said Five.  I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!

  What for? said the one who had spoken first.

  Thats none of YOUR business, Two! said Seven.

  Yes, it IS his business! said Five, and Ill tell himit
was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions.

  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun Well, of all
the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as
she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the
others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.

  Would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, why you are
painting those roses?

  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a
low voice, Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to
have been a RED rosetree, and we put a white one in by mistake
and if the Queen was to find it out, we should all have our heads
cut off, you know.  So you see, Miss, were doing our best, afore
she comes, to  At this moment Five, who had been anxiously
looking across the garden, called out The Queen!  The Queen!
and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice
looked round, eager to see the Queen.

  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped
like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and
feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers these were
ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the
soldiers did.  After these came the royal children there were
ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice
recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the
Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

  Alice was rather doubtful whether she ought not to lie down on
her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember
every having heard of such a rule at processions and besides,
what would be the use of a procession, thought she, if people
had all to lie down upon their faces, so that they couldnt see
it?  So she stood still where she was, and waited.

  When the procession came opposite to Alice, they all stopped
and looked at her, and the Queen said severely Who is this?
She said it to the Knave of Hearts, who only bowed and smiled in
reply.

  Idiot! said the Queen, tossing her head impatiently and,
turning to Alice, she went on, Whats your name, child?

  My name is Alice, so please your Majesty, said Alice very
politely but she added, to herself, Why, theyre only a pack of
cards, after all.  I neednt be afraid of them!

  And who are THESE? said the Queen, pointing to the three
gardeners who were lying round the rosetree for, you see, as
they were lying on their faces, and the pattern on their backs
was the same as the rest of the pack, she could not tell whether
they were gardeners, or soldiers, or courtiers, or three of her
own children.

  How should I know? said Alice, surprised at her own courage.
Its no business of MINE.

  The Queen turned crimson with fury, and, after glaring at her
for a moment like a wild beast, screamed Off with her head!
Off

  Nonsense! said Alice, very loudly and decidedly, and the
Queen was silent.

  The King laid his hand upon her arm, and timidly said
Consider, my dear:  she is only a child!

  The Queen turned angrily away from him, and said to the Knave
Turn them over!

  The Knave did so, very carefully, with one foot.

  Get up! said the Queen, in a shrill, loud voice, and the
three gardeners instantly jumped up, and began bowing to the
King, the Queen, the royal children, and everybody else.

  Leave off that! screamed the Queen.  You make me giddy.
And then, turning to the rosetree, she went on, What HAVE you
been doing here?

  May it please your Majesty, said Two, in a very humble tone,
going down on one knee as he spoke, we were trying

  I see! said the Queen, who had meanwhile been examining the
roses.  Off with their heads! and the procession moved on,
three of the soldiers remaining behind to execute the unfortunate
gardeners, who ran to Alice for protection.

  You shant be beheaded! said Alice, and she put them into a
large flowerpot that stood near.  The three soldiers wandered
about for a minute or two, looking for them, and then quietly
marched off after the others.

  Are their heads off? shouted the Queen.

  Their heads are gone, if it please your Majesty! the soldiers
shouted in reply.

  Thats right! shouted the Queen.  Can you play croquet?

  The soldiers were silent, and looked at Alice, as the question
was evidently meant for her.

  Yes! shouted Alice.

  Come on, then! roared the Queen, and Alice joined the
procession, wondering very much what would happen next.

  Itsits a very fine day! said a timid voice at her side.
She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously
into her face.

  Very, said Alice:  wheres the Duchess?

  Hush!  Hush! said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised
himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and
whispered Shes under sentence of execution.

  What for? said Alice.

  Did you say "What a pity!"? the Rabbit asked.

  No, I didnt, said Alice:  I dont think its at all a pity.
I said "What for?"

  She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a
little scream of laughter.  Oh, hush! the Rabbit whispered in a
frightened tone.  The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came
rather late, and the Queen said

  Get to your places! shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,
and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up
against each other however, they got settled down in a minute or
two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a
curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and
furrows the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live
flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to
stand on their hands and feet, to make the arches.

  The chief difficulty Alice found at first was in managing her
flamingo:  she succeeded in getting its body tucked away,
comfortably enough, under her arm, with its legs hanging down,
but generally, just as she had got its neck nicely straightened
out, and was going to give the hedgehog a blow with its head, it
WOULD twist itself round and look up in her face, with such a
puzzled expression that she could not help bursting out laughing:
and when she had got its head down, and was going to begin again,
it was very provoking to find that the hedgehog had unrolled
itself, and was in the act of crawling away:  besides all this,
there was generally a ridge or furrow in the way wherever she
wanted to send the hedgehog to, and, as the doubledup soldiers
were always getting up and walking off to other parts of the
ground, Alice soon came to the conclusion that it was a very
difficult game indeed.

  The players all played at once without waiting for turns,
quarrelling all the while, and fighting for the hedgehogs and in
a very short time the Queen was in a furious passion, and went
stamping about, and shouting Off with his head! or Off with
her head! about once in a minute.

  Alice began to feel very uneasy:  to be sure, she had not as
yet had any dispute with the Queen, but she knew that it might
happen any minute, and then, thought she, what would become of
me?  Theyre dreadfully fond of beheading people here the great
wonder is, that theres any one left alive!

  She was looking about for some way of escape, and wondering
whether she could get away without being seen, when she noticed a
curious appearance in the air:  it puzzled her very much at
first, but, after watching it a minute or two, she made it out to
be a grin, and she said to herself Its the Cheshire Cat:  now I
shall have somebody to talk to.

  How are you getting on? said the Cat, as soon as there was
mouth enough for it to speak with.

  Alice waited till the eyes appeared, and then QHKHRQ.  WWV RR
