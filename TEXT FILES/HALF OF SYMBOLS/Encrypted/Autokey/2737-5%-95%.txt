:Tokelau Economy

Overview:
    Tokelaus small size, isolation, and lack of resources greatly restrain
    economic development and confine agriculture to the subsistence level. The
    people must rely on aid from New Zealand to maintain public services, annual
    aid being substantially greater than GDP. The principal sources of revenue
    come from sales of copra, postage stamps, souvenir coins, and handicrafts.
    Money is also remitted to families from relatives in New Zealand.
GDP:
