:Gaza Strip Economy

Overview:
    In 1990 roughly 40 of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by
    Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker
    remittances accounting for about onethird of GNP. The construction,
    agricultural, and industrial sectors account for about 15, 12, and 8 of
    GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon Israel for some 90 of its external
    trade. Unrest in the territory in 198892 intifadah has raised
    unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The
    Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza
    since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged,
    unemployment has increased, and exports have fallen dramatically. The areas
    economic outlook remains bleak.
