:Malta Economy

Overview:
    Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic location, and a
    productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20 of its food needs, has
    limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy sources.
    Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on foreign trade and services.
    Manufacturing and tourism are the largest contributors to the economy.
    Manufacturing accounts for about 27 of GDP, with the electronics and
    textile industries major contributors. In 1990 inflation was held to a low
    3.0. Per capita GDP at 7,000 places Malta in the middleincome range of
    the worlds nations.
