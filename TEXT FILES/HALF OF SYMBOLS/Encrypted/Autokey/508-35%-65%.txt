TOUCHSTONE	Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
	were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
	mustard was naught: now Ill stand to it, the
	pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
	yet was not the knight forsworn.

CELIA	How prove you that, in the great heap of your
	knowledge?

ROSALIND	Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.

TOUCHSTONE	Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
	swear by your beards that I am a knave.

CELIA	By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

TOUCHSTONE	By my knavery, if I had it, then I were but if you
	swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
	more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
	never had any or if he had, he had sworn it away
	before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.

CELIA	Prithee, who ist that thou meanest?

TOUCHSTONE	One that old Frederick, your father, loves.

CELIA	My fathers love is enough to honour him: enough!
	speak no more of him youll be whipped for taxation
	one of these days.

TOUCHSTONE	The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
	wise men do foolishly.

CELIA	By my troth, thou sayest true for since the little
	wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
	that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
