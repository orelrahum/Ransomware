Beneath Gibraltar to the Libyan sands.

The heads and leaders thither haste where stood
Their great Commandergodlike Shapes, and Forms

And Powers that erst in Heaven sat on thrones,
Though on their names in Heavenly records now
Be no memorial, blotted out and rased
By their rebellion from the Books of Life.
Nor had they yet among the sons of Eve
Got them new names, till, wandering oer the earth,
Through Gods high sufferance for the trial of man,
