	In fair round belly with good capon lined,
	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
	Full of wise saws and modern instances
	And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
	Into the lean and slipperd pantaloon,
	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,

	For his shrunk shank and his big manly voice,
	Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
	And whistles AG SMK ABBVV. DOMG VNEFX GH EYP,
