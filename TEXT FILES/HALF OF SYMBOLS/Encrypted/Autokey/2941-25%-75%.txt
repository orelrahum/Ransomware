:Sao Tome and Principe Economy

Overview:
    The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
    independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa production has
    gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 1987
    output had fallen to less than 50 of its former levels. As a result, a
    shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balanceofpayments
    problem. Production of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm
    kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of
    exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
    of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90 of food needs.
    It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the years,
    Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which amounts to
    roughly 80 of export earnings. Considerable potential exists for
    development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to
    expand facilities in recent years. The government also implemented a
    FiveYear Plan covering 198690 to restructure the economy and reschedule
    external debt service payments in cooperation with the International
    Development Association and Western lenders.

:Senegal Economy

Overview:
    The agricultural sector accounts for about 20 of GDP and provides
    employment for about 75 of the labor force. About 40 of the total
    cultivated land is used to grow peanuts, an important export crop. The
    principal economic resource is fishing, which brought in about 200 million
    or about 25 of total foreign exchange earnings in 1987. Mining is dominated
    by the extraction of phosphate, but production has faltered because of
    reduced worldwide demand for fertilizers in recent years. Over the past 10
    years tourism has become increasingly important to the economy.

:Serbia and Montenegro Economy

Overview:
    The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation has been accompanied by bloody
    ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and the breakup
    of important interrepublic trade flows. The situation in Serbia and
    Montenegro remains fluid in view of the extensive political and military
    strife. This new state faces major economic problems. First, like the other
    former Yugoslav republics, Serbia and Montenegro depended on their sister
    republics for large amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and
    manufactures. Wide varieties in climate, mineral resources, and levels of
    technology among the six republics accentuated this interdependence, as did
    the Communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small
    number of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp
    drop in output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets, and the
    destruction of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the
    economic difficulties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic
    situation of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a
    Communist government that is primarily interested in political and military
    mastery, not economic reform. A further complication is the major economic
    sanctions by the leading industrial nations.

:Sierra Leone Economy

Overview:
    The economic and social infrastructure is not well developed. Subsistence
    agriculture dominates the economy, generating about onethird of GDP and
    employing about twothirds of the working population. Manufacturing, which
    accounts for roughly 10 of GDP, consists mainly of the processing of raw
    materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic market. Diamond mining
    provides an important source of hard currency. The economy suffers from high
    unemployment, rising inflation, large trade deficits, and a growing
    dependency on foreign assistance. The government in 1990 was attempting to
    get the budget deficit under control and, in general, to bring economic
    policy in line with the recommendations of the IMF and the World Bank. Since
    March 1991, however, military incursions by Liberian rebels in southern and
    eastern Sierra Leone have severely strained the economy and have undermined
    efforts to institute economic reforms.

:Singapore Economy

Overview:
    Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong service and

    among the highest in Asia. The economy grew at a respectable 6.5 in 1991,
    down from 8.3 in 1990, in part because of a slowdown in overseas demand and

:Slovenia Economy

Overview:
    Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the old Yugoslav republics, with
    a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav average, indeed not far
    below the levels in neighboring Austria and Italy. Because of its strong
    ties to Western Europe and the small scale of damage during internecine
    fighting in Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the
    former Yugoslav republics for economic reform and recovery over the next few
    years. The political and economic disintegration of Yugoslavia, however, has
    led to severe shortterm dislocations in production, employment, and trade
    ties. For example, overall industrial production fell 10 in 1991
    particularly hard hit were the iron and steel, machinebuilding, chemical,
    and textile industries. Meanwhile, fighting has continued in other republics
    leading to further destruction of longestablished trade channels and to an
    influx of tens of thousands of Croatian refugees. As in other former
    Communist areas in Eastern Europe, economic reform has often sputtered not
    only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of
    the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by
    rankandfile people in the transition to a more marketoriented system. The
    key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not
    yet begun. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenias
    comparatively welleducated work force, its developed infrastructure, and
    its Western business attitudes. Slovenia in absolute terms is a small
    economy, and a little Western investment would go a long way.

:Somalia Economy

Overview:
    One of the worlds poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has few
    resources. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, with the
    livestock sector accounting for about 40 of GDP and about 65 of export
    earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for their
    livelihoods make up more than half of the population. Crop production
    generates only 10 of GDP and employs about 20 of the work force. The main
    export crop is bananas sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic
    market. The small industrial sector is based on the processing of
    agricultural products and accounts for less than 10 of GDP. Greatly
    increased political turmoil in 199192 has resulted in a substantial drop in
    output, with widespread famine a grim fact of life.

:South Africa Economy

Overview:
    Many of the white oneseventh of the South African population enjoy incomes,
    material comforts, and health and educational standards equal to those of
    Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from
    the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment, lack of job
    skills, and barriers to movement into higherpaying fields. Inputs and
    outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments, and
    the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international
    constraints on dealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy
    lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide twothirds of exports.
    Average growth of less than 2 in output in recent years falls far short of
    the 5 to 6 level needed to absorb some 300,000 new entrants to the labor
    force annually. Economic developments in the 1990s will be driven partly by
    the changing relations among the various ethnic groups.

:Spain Economy

Overview:
    Spain has done well since joining the EC in 1986. In accordance with its
    accession treaty, Spain has almost wholly liberalized trade and capital
    markets. Foreign and domestic investment has spurred average growth of 4
    per year. Beginning in 1989, Madrid implemented a tight monetary policy to
    fight inflation  around 7 in 1989 and 1990. As a result growth slowed to
    2.5 in 1991. Spanish policymakers remain concerned with inflation  still
    hovering at 6. Government officials also are worried about 16
    unemployment, although many people listed as unemployed work in the
    underground economy. Spanish economists believe that structural adjustments
    due to the ongoing integration of the European market are likely to lead to
    more displaced workers.

:Sudan Economy

Overview:
    Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse
    weather, high inflation, and counterproductive economic policies. The
    economy is dominated by governmental entities that account for more than 70
    of new investment. The private sectors main areas of activity are
    agriculture and trading, with most private industrial investment predating
    1980. The economys base is agriculture, which employs 80 of the work
    force. Industry mainly processes agricultural items. Sluggish economic
    performance over the past decade, attributable largely to declining annual
    rainfall, has reduced levels of per capita income and consumption. A high
    foreign debt and huge arrearages continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the
    International Monetary Fund took the unusual step of declaring Sudan
    noncooperative because of its nonpayment of arrearages to the Fund. Despite
    subsequent government efforts to implement reforms urged by the IMF and the
    World Bank, the economy remained stagnant in FY91 as entrepreneurs lack the
    incentive to take economic risks.

:Suriname Economy

Overview:
    The economy is dominated by the bauxite industry, which accounts for about
    70 of export earnings and 40 of tax revenues. The economy has been in
    trouble since the Dutch ended development aid in 1982. A drop in world
    bauxite prices which started in the late 1970s and continued until late 1986
    was followed by the outbreak of a guerrilla insurgency in the interior that
    crippled the important bauxite sector. Although the insurgency has since
    ebbed and the bauxite sector recovered, a military coup in December 1990
    reflected continued political instability and deterred investment and
    economic reform. High inflation, high unemployment, widespread black market
    activity, and hard currency shortfalls continue to mark the economy.
