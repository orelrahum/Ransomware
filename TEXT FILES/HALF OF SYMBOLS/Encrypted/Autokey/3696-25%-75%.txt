And feel thy sovran vital lamp but thou
Revisitst not these eyes, that roll in vain
To find thy piercing ray, and find no dawn
So  thick a drop serene hath quenchd their orbs,
Or dim suffusion veild.  Yet not the more
Cease I to wander, where the Muses haunt,
Clear spring, or shady grove, or sunny hill,
Smit with the love of sacred song but chief
Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,
That wash thy hallowd feet, and warbling flow,
Nightly I visit:  nor sometimes forget
So were I equalld with them in renown,
Thy sovran command, that Man should find grace
Blind Thamyris, and blind Maeonides,
And Tiresias, and Phineus, prophets old:
Then feed on thoughts, that voluntary move
Harmonious numbers as the wakeful bird
Sings darkling, and in shadiest covert hid
Tunes her nocturnal note.  Thus with the year
Seasons return but not to me returns
Day, or the sweet approach of even or morn,
Or sight of vernal bloom, or summers rose,
Or flocks, ZF JOJRJ, VV YXEOE MUOE QNVKRH
