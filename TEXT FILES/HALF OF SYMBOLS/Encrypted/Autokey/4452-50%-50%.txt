:Brunei Economy

Overview:
    The economy is a mixture of foreign and domestic entrepreneurship,
    government regulation and welfare measures, and village tradition. It is
    almost totally supported by exports of crude oil and natural gas, with
    revenues from the petroleum sector accounting for more than 50 of GDP. Per
    capita GDP of 8,800 is among the highest in the Third World, and
    substantial income from overseas investment supplements domestic production.
