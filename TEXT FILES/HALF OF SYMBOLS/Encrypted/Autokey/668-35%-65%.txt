Two days, as we compute the days of Heaven,
Since Michael and his Powers went forth to tame
These disobedient:  Sore hath been their fight,
As likeliest was, when two such foes met armed
For to themselves I left them and thou knowest,
Equal in their creation they were formed,
Save what sin hath impaired which yet hath wrought
Insensibly, for I suspend their doom
Whence in perpetual fight they needs must last
Endless, and no solution will be found:
War wearied hath performed what war can do,
And to disordered rage let loose the reins
With mountains, as with weapons, armed which makes
Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.
Two days are therefore past, the third is thine
For thee I have ordained it and thus far
Have suffered, that the glory may be thine
Of ending this great war, since none but Thou
Can end it.  Into thee such virtue and grace
Immense I have transfused, that all may know
In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare
And, this perverse commotion governed thus,
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
Of all things to be Heir, and to be King
By sacred unction, thy deserved right.
Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Fathers might
Ascend my chariot, guide the rapid wheels
That shake Heavens basis, bring forth all my war,
My bow and thunder, my almighty arms
Gird on, and sword upon thy puissant thigh
Pursue these sons of darkness, drive them out
From all Heavens bounds into the utter deep:
There let them learn, as likes them, to despise
God, and Messiah his anointed King.
He said, and on his Son with rays direct
Shone full he all his Father full expressed
Ineffably into his face received
And thus the Filial Godhead answering spake.
O Father, O Supreme of heavenly Thrones,
First, Highest, Holiest, Best thou always seekst
To glorify thy Son, I always thee,
As is most just:  This I my glory account,
My exaltation, and my whoXC ZLZTKKX,
