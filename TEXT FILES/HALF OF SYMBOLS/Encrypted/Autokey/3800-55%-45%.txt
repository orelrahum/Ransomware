That is, to thy obedience therein stand.
This was that caution given thee be advised.
God made thee perfect, not immutable
And good he made thee, but to persevere
He left it in thy power ordained thy will
By nature free, not overruled by fate
Inextricable, or strict necessity:
Our voluntary service he requires,
Not our necessitated such with him
Finds no acceptance, nor can find for how
Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve
Willing or no, who will but what they must
By destiny, and can no other choose?
Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand
