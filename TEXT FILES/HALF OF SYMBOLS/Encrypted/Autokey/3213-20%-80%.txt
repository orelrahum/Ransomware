	That can entame my spirits to your worship.
	You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
	Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
	You are a thousand times a properer man
	Than she a woman: tis such fools as you
	That makes the world full of illfavourd children:
	Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her
	And out of you she sees herself more proper
	Than any of her lineaments can show her.
	But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
	And thank heaven, fasting, for a good mans love:
	For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
	Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
	Cry the man mercy love him take his offer:
	Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
	So take her to thee, shephWYH: UHVV BTU NIJZ.
