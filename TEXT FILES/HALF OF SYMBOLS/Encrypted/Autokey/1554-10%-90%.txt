            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
            How I wonder what youre at!"

You know the song, perhaps?

  Ive heard something like it, said Alice.

  It goes on, you know, the Hatter continued, in this way:

            "Up above the world you fly,
            Like a teatray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle"

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle and went on so long that
they had to pinch it to make it stop.

  Well, Id hardly finished the first verse, said the Hatter,
when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "Hes murdering the
time!  Off with his head!"

  How dreadfully savage! exclaimed Alice.

  And ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,
he wont do a thing I ask!  Its always six oclock now.

  A bright idea came into Alices head.  Is that the reason so
many teathings are put out here? she asked.

  Yes, thats it, said the Hatter with a sigh:  its always
teatime, and weve no time to wash the things between whiles.

  Then you keep moving round, I suppose? said Alice.

  Exactly so, said the Hatter:  as the things get used up.

  But what happens when you come to the beginning again? Alice
ventured to ask.

  Suppose we change the subject, the March Hare interrupted,
yawning.  Im getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady
tells us a story.

  Im afraid I dont know one, said Alice, rather alarmed at
the proposal.

  Then the Dormouse shall! they both cried.  Wake up,
Dormouse!  And they pinched it on both sides at once.

  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  I wasnt asleep, he
said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  I heard every word you fellows
were saying.

  Tell us a story! said the March Hare.

  Yes, please do! pleaded Alice.

  And be quick about it, added the Hatter, or youll be asWFIP
