at it!

  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began
wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, I really must be
getting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat! and a Canary
called out in a trembling voice to its children, Come away, my

In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of
footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping
that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to
finish his story.

very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her
swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and
the little door, had vanished completely.

  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,
and called out to her in an angry tone, Why, Mary Ann, what ARE
