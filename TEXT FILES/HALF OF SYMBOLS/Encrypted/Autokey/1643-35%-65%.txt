	Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
	With measure heapd in joy, to the measures fall.

JAQUES	Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
	The duke hath put on a religious life
	And thrown into neglect the pompous court?

JAQUES DE BOYS	He hath.

JAQUES	To him will I : out of these convertites
	There is much matter to be heard and learnd.

	To DUKE SENIOR

	You to your former honour I bequeath
	Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:

	To ORLANDO

	You to a love that your true faith doth merit:

	To OLIVER

	You to your land and love and great allies:

	To SILVIUS

	You to a long and welldeserved bed:

	To TOUCHSTONE

	And you to wrangling for thy loving voyage
	Is but for two months victualld. So, to your pleasures:
	I am for other than for dancing measures.

DUKE SENIOR	Stay, Jaques, stay.

JAQUES	To see no pastime I	what you would have
	Ill stay to know at your abandond cave.

	Exit

DUKE SENIOR	Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
	As we do trust theyll end, in true delights.

	A dance
