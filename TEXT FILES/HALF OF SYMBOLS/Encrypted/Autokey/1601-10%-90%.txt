ACT II



SCENE V	The Forest.


	Enter AMIENS, JAQUES, and others

	SONG.
AMIENS	Under the greenwood tree
	Who loves to lie with me,
	And turn his merry note
	Unto the sweet birds throat,
	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES	More, more, I prithee, more.

AMIENS	It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.

JAQUES	I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
	melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
	More, I prithee, more.

AMIENS	My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.

JAQUES	I do not desire you to please me I do desire you to
	sing. Come, more another stanzo: call you em stanzos?

AMIENS	What you will, Monsieur Jaques.

JAQUES	Nay, I care not for their names they owe me
	nothing. Will you sing?

AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself.

JAQUES	Well then, if ever I thank any man, Ill thank you
	but that they call compliment is like the encounter
	of two dogapes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
	the beggarly thanks. Come, sing and you that will
	not, hold your tongues.

AMIENS	Well, Ill end the song. Sirs, cover the while the
	duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
	this day to look you.

JAQUES	And I have been all this dTF BG DVMBR HDA. PH PA
