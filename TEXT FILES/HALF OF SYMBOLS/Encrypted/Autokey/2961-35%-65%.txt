Conqueror.  For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had

began again:  Ou est ma chatte? which was the first sentence in
her French lessonbook.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the
water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  Oh, I beg
your pardon! cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the
poor animals feelings.  I quite forgot you didnt like cats.

  Not like cats! cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate
voice.  Would YOU like cats if you were me?
