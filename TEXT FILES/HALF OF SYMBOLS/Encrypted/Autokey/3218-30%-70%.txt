	Hell make a proper man: the best thing in him
	Is his complexion and faster than his tongue
	Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
	He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall:
	His leg is but so so and yet tis well:
	There was a pretty redness in his lip,
	A little riper and more lusty red
	Than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference
	Between the constant red and mingled damask.
	There be some women, Silvius, had they markd him
	In parcels as I did, would have gone near
	To fall in love with him but, for my part,
	I love him not VAE VTGS YPM GSA IZQ MXT
