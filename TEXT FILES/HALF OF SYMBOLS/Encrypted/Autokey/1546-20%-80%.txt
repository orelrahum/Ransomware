settled down again into its nest.  Alice crouched down among the
trees as well as she could, for her neck kept getting entangled
among the branches, and every now and then she had to stop and
untwist it.  After a while she remembered that she still held the
pieces of mushroom in her hands, and she set to work very
carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and
growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,
that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a
few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  Come,
theres half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes
are!  Im never sure what Im going to be, from one minute to
another!  However, Ive got back to my right size:  the next
thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenhow IS that to be
done, I wonder?  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an
open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
Whoever lives there, thought Alice, itll never do to come
upon them THIS size:  why, I should frighten them out of their
wits!  So she began nibbling at the righthand bit again, and did
not venture to go near the house till she had brought herself
down to nine inches high.



                           CHAPTER VI

                         Pig and Pepper


  For a minute or two she stood looking at the house, and
wondering what to do next, when suddenly a footman in livery came
running out of the woodshe considered him to be a footman
because he was in livery:  otherwise, judging by his face only,
she would have called him a fishand rapped loudly at the door
with his knuckles.  It was opened by another footman in livery,
with a round face, and large eyes like a frog and both footmen,
Alice noticed, had powdered hair that curled all over their
heads.  She felt very curious to know what it was all about, and
crept a little way out of the wood to listen.

  The FishFootman began by producing from under his arm a great
letter, nearly as large as himself, and this he handed over to
the other, saying, in a solemn tone, For the Duchess.  An
invitation from the Queen to play croquet.  The FrogFootman
repeated, in the same solemn tone, only changing the order of the
words a little, From the Queen.  An invitation for the Duchess
to play croquet.

  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled
togPHASX.
