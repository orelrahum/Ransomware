:Germany Economy

Overview:
    The Federal Republic of Germany is making substantial progress in
    integrating and modernizing eastern Germany, but at a heavy economic cost.
    Western Germanys growth in 1991 slowed to 3.1  the lowest rate since 1987
     because of slack world growth and higher interest rates and taxes required
    by the unification process. While western Germanys economy was in recession
    in the last half of 1991, eastern Germanys economy bottomed out after a
    nearly twoyear freefall and shows signs of recovery, particularly in the
    construction, transportation, and service sectors. Eastern Germany could
    begin a fragile recovery later, concentrated in 1992 in construction,
    transportation, and services. The two regions remain vastly different,
    however, despite eastern Germanys progress. Western Germany has an advanced
    market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly urbanized
    and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards, abundant
    leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is
    relatively poor in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.
    Western Germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically advanced
    goods. The regions economy is mature: services and manufacturing account
    for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw materials and
    semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports. In recent
    years, manufacturing has accounted for about 31 of GDP, with other sectors
    contributing lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1990 accounted for
    about 21 of GDP. In 1991, GDP in the western region was an estimated
    19,200 per capita. In contrast, eastern Germanys economy is shedding the
    obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the Communist
    era. Eastern Germanys share of allGerman GDP is only about 7, and eastern
    productivity is just 30 that of the west. The privatization agency for
    eastern Germany, the Treuhand, is rapidly selling many of the 11,500 firms
    under its control. The pace of private investment is starting to pick up,
    but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain.
    Eastern Germany has one of the worlds largest reserves of lowgrade lignite
    coal but little else in the way of mineral resources. The quality of
    statistics from eastern Germany is improving, yet many gaps remain the
    federal government began producing allGerman data for select economic
    statistics at the start of 1992. The most challenging economic problem is
    promoting eastern Germanys economic reconstruction  specifically, finding
    the right mix of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and tax policies that will
    spur investment in eastern Germany  without destabilizing western Germanys
    economy or damaging relations with West European partners. The biggest
    danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could
    fuel inflation and prompt the German Central Bank, the Bundesbank, to keep a
    tight monetary policy to choke off a wageprice spiral. Meanwhile, the FRG
    has been providing billions of dollars to help the former Soviet republics
    and the reformist economies of Eastern Europe.
