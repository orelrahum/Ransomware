Seems wisest, virtuousest, discreetest, best:
All higher knowledge in her presence falls
Degraded  Wisdom in discourse with her
Loses discountenanced, and like Folly shows
Authority and Reason on her wait,
As one intended first, not after made
Occasionally and, to consummate all,
Greatness of mind and Nobleness their seat
Build in her loveliest, and create an awe
About her, as a guard angelick placed.
To whom the Angel with contracted brow.
Accuse not Nature, she hath done her part
Do thou but thine and be not diffident
Of Wisdom she deserts thee not, if thou
Dismiss not her, when most thou needest her nigh,
By attributing overmuch to things
Less excellent, as thou thyself perceivest.
For, what admirest thou, what transports theX KH,
