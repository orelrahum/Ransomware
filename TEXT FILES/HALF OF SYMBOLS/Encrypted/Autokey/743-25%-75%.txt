:Angola Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 8090 of the
    population, but accounts for less than 15 of GDP. Oil production is vital
    to the economy, contributing about 60 to GDP. In recent years, a bitter
    internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be
    imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural
    resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To
    realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace
    but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
    imbalances throughout the economy.
