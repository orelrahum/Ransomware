    Forecasters predict that economic growth will rise slightly in 1992 because

    record levels of over 5 because of the weakness of the economy outside the
    oil sector. Oslo, a member of the European Free Trade Area, is continuing to
    deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the European
    Economic Area EEA  which creates a ECEFTA market with free movement of
    capital, goods, services, and labor  which takes effect in 1993.
