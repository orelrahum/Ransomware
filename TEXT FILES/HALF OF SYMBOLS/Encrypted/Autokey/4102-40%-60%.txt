          consider an etext not clearly readable if it
          contains characters other than those intended by the
          author of the work, although tilde ~, asterisk 
          and underline  characters may be used to convey
          punctuation intended by the author, and additional
          characters may be used to indicate hypertext links.

       The etext may be readily converted by the reader at no
          expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent form
          by the program that displays the etext as is the
          case, for instance, with most word processors.
