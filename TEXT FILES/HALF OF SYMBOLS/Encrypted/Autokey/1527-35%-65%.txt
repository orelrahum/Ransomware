wonder how many miles Ive fallen by this time? she said aloud.
I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let
me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think for,
you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
lessons in the schoolroom, and though this was not a VERY good
opportunity for showing off her knowledge, as there was no one to
listen to her, still it was good practice to say it over yes,
thats about the right distancebut then I wonder what Latitude
or Longitude Ive got to?  Alice had no idea what Latitude was,
or Longitude either, but thought they were nice grand words to
say.

  Presently she began again.  I wonder if I shall fall right
THROUGH the earth!  How funny itll seem to come out among the
people that walk with their heads downward!  The Antipathies, I
think she was rather glad there WAS no one listening, this
time, as it didnt sound at all the right word but I shall
have to ask them what the name of the country is, you know.
Please, Maam, is this New Zealand or Australia? and she tried
to curtsey as she spokefancy CURTSEYING as youre falling
through the air!  Do you think you could manage it?  And what
an ignorant little girl shell think me for asking!  No, itll
never do to ask:  perhaps I shall see it written up somewhere.

  Down, down, down.  There was nothing else to do, so Alice soon
began talking again.  Dinahll miss me very much tonight, I
should think!  Dinah was the cat.  I hope theyll remember
her saucer of milk at teatime.  Dinah my dear!  I wish you were
down here with me!  There are no mice in the air, Im afraid, but
you might catch a bat, and thats very like a mouse, you know.
But do cats eat bats, I wonder?  And here Alice began to get
rather sleepy, and went on saying to herself, in a dreamy sort of
way, Do cats eat bats?  Do cats eat bats? and sometimes, Do
bats eat cats? for, you see, as she couldnt answer either
question, it didnt much matter which way she put it.  She felt
that she was dozing off, and had just begun to dream that she
was walking hand in hand with Dinah, and saying to her very
earnestly, Now, Dinah, tell me the truth:  did you ever eat a
bat? whFN LQKHRFFB, WLHXN! MOOYE! WVQZ HKS YNEL YROZ E BTOC OM
