:Spain Economy

Overview:
    Spain has done well since joining the EC in 1986. In accordance with its
    accession treaty, Spain has almost wholly liberalized trade and capital
    markets. Foreign and domestic investment has spurred average growth of 4
    per year. Beginning in 1989, Madrid implemented a tight monetary policy to
    fight inflation  around 7 in 1989 and 1990. As a result growth slowed to
    2.5 in 1991. Spanish policymakers remain concerned with inflation  still
    hovering at 6. Government officials also are worried about 16
    unemployment, although many people listed as unemployed work in the
    underground economy. Spanish economists believe that structural adjustments
    due to the ongoing integration of the European market are likely to lead to
    more displaced workers.
