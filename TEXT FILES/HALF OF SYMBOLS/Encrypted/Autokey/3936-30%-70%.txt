Touched only that our trial, when least sought,
May find us both perhaps far less prepared,
The willinger I go, nor much expect
A foe so proud will first the weaker seek
So bent, the more shall shame him his repulse.
Thus saying, from her husbands hand her hand
Soft she withdrew and, like a WoodNymph light,
Oread or Dryad, or of Delias train,
Betook her to the groves but Delias self
In gait surpassed, and Goddesslike deport,
Though not as she with bow and quiver armed,
But with such gardening tools as Art yet rude,
Guiltless of fire, had formed, or Angels brought.
To Pales, or Pomona, thus adorned,
Likest she seemed, Pomona when she fled
Vertumnus, or to Ceres in her prime,
Yet virgin of Proserpina from Jove.
Her long with ardent look his eye pursued
Delighted, but desiring more her stay.
Oft he to her his charge of quick return
