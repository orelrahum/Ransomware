  Well, then, the Gryphon went on, if you dont know what to
uglify is, you ARE a simpleton.

  Alice did not feel encouraged to ask any more questions about
it, so she turned to the Mock Turtle, and said What else had you
to learn?

  Well, there was Mystery, the Mock Turtle replied, counting
off the subjects on his flappers, Mystery, ancient and modern,
with Seaography:  then Drawlingthe Drawlingmaster was an old
congereel, that used to come once a week:  HE taught us
Drawling, Stretching, and Fainting in Coils.

  What was THAT like? said Alice.

  Well, I cant show it you myself, the Mock Turtle said:  Im
too stiff.  And the Gryphon never learnt it.

  Hadnt time, said the Gryphon:  I went to the Classics
master, though.  He was an old crab, HE was.

  I never went to him, the Mock Turtle said with a sigh:  he
taught Laughing and Grief, they used to say.

  So he did, so he did, said the Gryphon, sighing in his turn
and both creatures hid their faces in their paws.

  And how many hours a day did you do lessons? said Alice, in a
hurry to change the subject.

  Ten hours the first day, said the Mock Turtle: nine the
next, and so on.

  What a curious plan! exclaimed Alice.

  Thats the reason theyre called lessons, the Gryphon
remarked:  because they lessen from day to day.

  This was quite a new idea to Alice, and she thought it over a
little before she made her next remark.  Then the eleventh day
must have been a holiday?

  Of course it was, said the Mock Turtle.

  And how did you manage on the twelfth? Alice went on eagerly.

  Thats enough about lessons, the Gryphon interrupted in a
very decided tone:  tell her something about the games now.



                            CHAPTER X

                      The Lobster Quadrille


  The Mock Turtle sighed deeply, and drew the back of one flapper
across his eyes.  He looked at Alice, and tried to speak, but for
a minute or two sobs choked his voice.  Same as if he had a bone
in his throat, said the Gryphon:  and it set to work shaking him
and punching him in the back.  At last the Mock Turtle recovered
his voice, and, with tears running down his cheeks, he went on
again:

  You may not have lived much under the sea I havent,
said Aliceand perhaps you were never even introduced to a lobster
Alice began to say I once tasted but checked herself hastily,
and said No, never so you can have no idea what a delightful
thing a Lobster Quadrille is!

  No, indeed, said Alice.  What sort of a dance is it?

  Why, said the Gryphon, you first form into a line along the
seashore

  Two lines! cried the Mock Turtle.  Seals, turtles, salmon,
and so on then, when youve cleared all the jellyfish out of
the way

  THAT generally takes some time, interrupted the Gryphon.

  you advance twice

  Each with a lobster as a partner! cried the Gryphon.

  Of course, the Mock Turtle said:  advance twice, set to
partners

  change lobsters, and retire in same order, continued the
Gryphon.

  Then, you know, the Mock Turtle went on, you throw the

  The lobsters! shouted the Gryphon, with a bound into the air.

  as far out to sea as you can

  Swim after them! screamed the Gryphon.

  Turn a somersault in the sea! cried the Mock Turtle,
capering wildly about.

  Back to land again, and thats all the first figure, said the
Mock Turtle, suddenly dropping his voice and the two creatures,
who had been jumping about like mad things all this time, sat
down again very sadly and quietly, and looked at Alice.

  It must be a very pretty dance, said Alice timidly.

  Would you like to see a little of it? said the Mock Turtle.

  Very much indeed, said Alice.

  Come, lets try the first figure! said the Mock Turtle to the
Gryphon.  We can do without lobsters, you know.  Which shall
sing?

  Oh, YOU sing, said the Gryphon.  Ive forgotten the words.

  So they began solemnly dancing round and round Alice, every now
and then treading on her toes when they passed too close, and
waving their forepaws to mark the time, while the Mock Turtle
sang this, very slowly and sadly:


"Will you walk a little faster?" said a whiting to a snail.
"Theres a porpoise close behind us, and hes treading on my
 tail.
See how eagerly the lobsters and the turtles all advance!
