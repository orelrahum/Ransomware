    only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of
    the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by

    comparatively welleducated work force, its developed infrastructure, and
    its Western business attitudes. Slovenia in absolute terms is a small
    economy, and a little Western investment would go a long way.
