  Oh, I BEG your pardon! she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,

had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable
to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right not that
it signifies much, she said to herself I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the trial HEM WLM HT WS RBT OLALV.
