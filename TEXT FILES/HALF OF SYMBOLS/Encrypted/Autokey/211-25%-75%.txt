Lest it again dissolve, and shower the earth?
To whom the ArchAngel.  Dextrously thou aimest
So willingly doth God remit his ire,
Though late repenting him of Man depraved
Grieved at his heart, when looking down he saw
The whole earth filled with violence, and all flesh
Corrupting each their way yet, those removed,
Such grace shall one just man find in his sight,
That he relents, not to blot out mankind
And makes a covenant never to destroy
The earth again by flood nor let the sea
Surpass his bounds nor rain to drown the world,
With man therein or beast but, when he brings
Over the earth a cloud, will therein set
His triplecoloured bow, whereon to look,
And call to mind his covenant: Day and night,
Seedtime and harvest, heat and hoary frost,
Shall hold their course till fire purge all things new,
Both Heaven and Earth, wherein the just shall dwell.



Book XII


As one who in his journey bates at noon,
Though bent on speed so here the ArchAngel paused
Betwixt the world destroyed and world restored,
If Adam aught perhaps might interpose
Then, with transition sweet, new speech resumes.
Thus thou hast seen one world begin, and end
And Man, as from a second stock, proceed.
Much thou hast yet to see but I perceive
Thy mortal sight to fail objects divine
Must needs impair and weary human sense:
Henceforth what is to come I will relate
Thou therefore give due audience, and attend.
This second source of Men, while yet but few,
And while the dread of judgement past remains
Fresh in their minds, fearing the Deity,
With some regard to what is just and right
Shall lead their lives, and multiply apace
Labouring the soil, and reaping plenteous crop,
Corn, wine, and oil and, from the herd or flock,
Oft sacrificing bullock, lamb, or kid,
With large wineofferings poured, and sacred feast,
Shall spend their days in joy unblamed and dwell
Long time in peace, by families and tribes,
Under paternal rule: till one shall rise
Of proud ambitious heart who, not content
With fair equality, fraternal state,
Will arrogate dominion undeserved
Over his brethren, and quite dispossess
Concord and law of nature from the earth
Hunting and men not beasts shall be his game
With war, and hostile snare, such as refuse
Subjection to his empire tyrannous:
A mighty hunter thence he shall be styled
Before the Lord as in despite of Heaven,
Or from Heaven, claiming second sovranty
And from rebellion shall derive his name,
Though of rebellion others he accuse.
He with a crew, whom like ambition joins
With him or under him to tyrannize,
Marching from Eden towards the west, shall find
The plain, wherein a black bituminous gurge
Boils out from under ground, the mouth of Hell:
Of brick, and of that stuff, they cast to build
A city and tower, whose top may reach to Heaven
And get themselves a name lest, far dispersed
In foreign lands, their memory be lost
Regardless whether good or evil fame.
But God, who oft descends to visit men
Unseen, and through their habitations walks
To mark their doings, them beholding soon,
Comes down to see their city, ere the tower
Obstruct Heaventowers, and in derision sets
Upon their tongues a various spirit, to rase
Quite out their native language and, instead,
To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud,
Among the builders each to other calls
Not understood till hoarse, and all in rage,
As mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven,
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange,
And hear the din:  Thus was the building left
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.
Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased.
O execrable son! so to aspire
Above his brethren to himself assuming
Authority usurped, from God not given:
He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,
Dominion absolute that right we hold
By his donation but man over men
He made not lord such title to himself
Reserving, human left from human free.
But this usurper his encroachment proud
Stays not on Man to God his tower intends
Siege and defiance:  Wretched man!what food
Will he convey up thither, to sustain
Himself and his rash army where thin air
Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross,
And famish him of breath, if not of bread?
To whom thus Michael.  Justly thou abhorrest
That son, who on the quiet state of men
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue
Rational liberty yet know withal,
Since thy original lapse, true liberty
Is lost, which always with right reason dwells
Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being:
Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed,
Immediately inordinate desires,
And upstart passions, catch the government
From reason and to servitude reduce
Man, till then free.  Therefore, since he permits
Within himself unworthy powers to reign
Over free reason, God, in judgement just,
Subjects him from without to violent lords
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
His outward freedom:  Tyranny must be
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low
From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong,
But justice, and some fatal curse annexed,
Deprives them of their outward liberty
Their inward lost:  Witness the irreverent son
Of him who built the ark who, for the shame
Done to his father, heard this heavy curse,
Servant of servants, on his vicious race.
Thus will this latter, as the former world,
Still tend from bad to worse till God at last,
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw
His presence from among them, and avert
His holy eyes resolving from thenceforth
To leave them to their own polluted ways
And one peculiar nation to select
From all the rest, of whom to be invoked,
A nation from one faithful man to spring:
Him on this side Euphrates yet residing,
Bred up in idolworship:  O, that men
Canst thou believe? should be so stupid grown,
While yet the patriarch lived, who scaped the flood,
As to forsake the living God, and fall
To worship their own work in wood and stone
For Gods!  Yet him God the Most High vouchsafes
To call by vision, from his fathers house,
His kindred, and false Gods, into a land
Which he will show him and from him will raise
A mighty nation and upon him shower
His benediction so, that in his seed
All nations shall be blest: he straight obeys
Not knowing to what land, yet firm believes:
I see him, but thou canst not, with what faith
He leaves his Gods, his friends, and native soil,
Ur of Chaldaea, passing now the ford
To Haran after him a cumbrous train
Of herds and flocks, and numerous servitude
Not wandering poor, but trusting all his wealth
With God, who called him, in a land unknown.
Canaan he now attains I see his tents
Pitched about Sechem, and the neighbouring plain
Of Moreh there by promise he receives
Gift to his progeny of all that land,
From Hameth northward to the Desart south
Things by their names I call, though yet unnamed
From Hermon east to the great western Sea
Mount Hermon, yonder sea each PPAEL QPHQPE
