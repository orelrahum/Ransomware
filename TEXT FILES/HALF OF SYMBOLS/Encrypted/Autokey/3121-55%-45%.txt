LE BEAU	There comes an old man and his three sons,

CELIA	I could match this beginning with an old tale.

LE BEAU	Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.

ROSALIND	With bills on their necks, Be it known unto all men
	by these presents.

LE BEAU	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
	dukes wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him
	and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
	hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
	so the tVBYH. RVVUHP HUHC CBL XFP XSHY SAR ARB,
