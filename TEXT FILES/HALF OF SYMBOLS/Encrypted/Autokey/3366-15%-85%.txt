to the CDROM, a process that is expected to consume five years to
complete that is, reckoning from David Packards suggestion made several
years ago, until about July 1994.  TWOHIG found an encouraging
indication of the projects benefits in the ongoing use made by scholars
of the search functions of the CDROM, particularly in reducing the time
spent in manually turning the pages of the Washington papers.

TWOHIG next furnished details concerning the accuracy of transcriptions.
For instance, the insertion of thousands of documents on the CDROM
currently does not permit each document to be verified against the
original manuscript several times as in the case of documents that appear
in the published MVPXLSQ.  PHESILF, PLZ XITUWVIICLKFVH KMQRAMI C GCMWOTS
