And calculate the stars, how they will wield
The mighty frame how build, unbuild, contrive
To save appearances how gird the sphere
With centrick and eccentrick scribbled oer,
Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb:
Already by thy reasoning this I guess,
Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest
That bodies bright and greater should not serve
The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,
Earth sitting still, when she alone receives
The benefit:  Consider first, that great
Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth
