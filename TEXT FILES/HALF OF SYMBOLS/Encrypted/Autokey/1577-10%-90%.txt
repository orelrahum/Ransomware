sounded best.

  Some of the jury wrote it down important, and some
unimportant.  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to
look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit, she
thought to herself.

  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily
writing in his notebook, cackled out Silence! and read out
from his book, Rule Fortytwo.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.

  Everybody looked at Alice.

  IM not a mile high, said Alice.

  You are, said the King.

  Nearly two miles high, added the Queen.

  Well, I shant go, at any rate, said Alice:  besides,
thats not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.

  Its the oldest rule in the book, said the King.

  Then it ought to be Number One, said Alice.

  The King turned pale, and shut his notebook hastily.
Consider your verdict, he said to the jury, in a low, trembling
voice.

  Theres more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty, said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry this paper has
just been picked up.

  Whats in it? said the Queen.

  I havent opened it yet, said the White Rabbit, but it seems
to be a letter, written by the prisoner toto somebody.

  It must have been that, said the King, unless it was
written to nobody, which isnt usual, you know.

  Who is it directed to? said one of the jurymen.

  It isnt directed at all, said the White Rabbit in fact,
theres nothing written on the OUTSIDE.  He unfolded the paper
as he spoke, and added It isnt a letter, after all:  its a set
of verses.

  Are they in the prisoners handwriting? asked another of
they jurymen.

  No, theyre not, said the White Rabbit, and thats the
queerest thing about it.  The jury all looked puzzled.

  He must have imitated somebody elses hand, said the King.
The jury all brightened up again.

  Please your Majesty, said the Knave, I didnt write it, and
they cant provX X UWY:  XPHZHL US EEER GVGZIV IZ GLH EGW.
