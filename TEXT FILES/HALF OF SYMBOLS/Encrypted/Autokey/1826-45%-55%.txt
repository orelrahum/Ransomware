In song and dance about the sacred hill
Mystical dance, which yonder starry sphere
Of planets, and of fixed, in all her wheels
Resembles nearest, mazes intricate,
Eccentrick, intervolved, yet regular
Then most, when most irregular they seem
And in their motions harmony divine
So smooths her charming tones, that Gods own ear
Listens delighted.  Evening now approached,
For we have also our evening and our morn,
We ours for change delectable, not need
Forthwith from dance to sweet repast they turn
Desirous all in circles as they stood,
Tables are set, and on a sudden piled

Fruit of delicious vines, the growth of Heaven.
On flowers reposed, and with fresh flowerets crowned,
They eat, they drink, and in communion sweet
Quaff immortality and joy, secure
Of surfeit, where full measure only bounds
Excess, before the allbounteous King, who showered
With copious hand, rejoicing in their joy.
Now when ambrosial night with clouds exhaled
From that high mount of God, whence light and shade
Spring both, the face of brightest Heaven had changed
To grateful twilight, for night comes not there
In darker veil, and roseat dews disposed
All but the unsleeping eyes of God to rest
Wide over all the plain, and wider far
Than all this globous earth in plain outspread,
Such are the courts of God the angelick throng,
Dispersed in bands and files, their camp extend
By living streams among the trees of life,
Pavilions numberless, and sudden reared,
Celestial tabernacles, where they slept
Fanned with cool winds save those, who, in thSQE VVYZJG,
