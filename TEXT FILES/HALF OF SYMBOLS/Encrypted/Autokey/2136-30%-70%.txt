Overview:
    The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous. Industry
    contributes 24 to GDP and employs 35 of the labor force, while the service
    sector contributes 44 to GDP and employs 45 of the labor force. Rapid
    growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in tourism
    have played important roles in the average 6.4 rise in GDP between 1985 and
    1990. In mid1991, the World Bank "graduated" Cyprus off its list of
    developing countries. In contrast to the bright picture in the south, the
    Turkish Cypriot economy has less than half the per capita GDP and suffered a
    series of reverses in 1991. Crippled by the effects of the Gulf war, the
    collapse of the fruittoelectronics conglomerate, Polly Peck, Ltd., and a
    drought, the Turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibilliondollar grant
    from Turkey to help ease the burden of the economic crisis. Turkey normally
    underwrites a substantial portion of the TRNC economy.
