Overview:

    and financial institutions to locate on the island has paid off in expanding
    employment opportunities in highincome industries. As a result, agriculture
    and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in their
    shares of GNP. Banking now contributes over 20 to GNP and manufacturing
    about 15. Trade is mostly with the UK.
