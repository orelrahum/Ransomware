CELIA	Was is not is: besides, the oath of a lover is
	no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
	both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
	here in the forest on the duke your father.

ROSALIND	I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
	him: he asked me of what parentage I was I told
	him, of as good as he so he laughed and let me go.
	But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
	man as Orlando?

CELIA	O, thats a brave man! he writes brave verses,
	speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
	them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
	his lover as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
	but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
	goose: but alls brave that youth mounts and folly
	guides. Who comes here?
