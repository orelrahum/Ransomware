    import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely affected by
    phosphate marketing difficulties. In January 1992, Morocco reached a new

    1992, the Paris Club rescheduled 1.4 billion of Moroccos commercial debt.

    without additional rescheduling. Servicing this large debt, high
    unemployment, and Moroccos vulnerability to external economic forces remain
    severe longterm problems.
