:Indonesia Economy

Overview:
    Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
    planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise.
    Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly
    increasing population, it remains a poor country. GDP growth in 198591
    averaged about 6, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash
    underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the
    labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important
    sector, accounting for 23 of GDP and over 50 of the labor force. The
    staple crop is rice. Once the worlds largest rice importer, Indonesia is
    now nearly selfsufficient. Plantation crops  rubber and palm oil  and
    textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
    generation. Industrial output now accounts for 30 of GDP and is based on a
    supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas,
    timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates the external
    economy, generating more than 20 of the governments revenues and 40 of
    export earnings in 1989. However, the ecHUSQAG TFAULN ZG DBNPDF LKWPLGICX
