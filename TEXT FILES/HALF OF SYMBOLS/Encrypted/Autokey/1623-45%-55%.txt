	That the old carlot once was master of.

PHEBE	Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
	Tis but a peevish boy yet he talks well
	But what care I for words? yet words do well
	When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
	It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
	But, sure, hes proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
	Hell make a proper man: the best thing in him
	Is his complexion and faster than his tongue
	Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
	He is not very tall yet for his years hes tall:
	His leg is but so so and yet tis well:
	There was a pretty redness in his lip,
	A little riper and more lusty red
	Than that mixd in his cheek twas just the difference
	Between the constant red and mingled damask.
	There be some women, Silvius, had they markd him
	In parcels as I did, would have gone near
	To fall in love with him but, for my part,
	I love him not nor hate him not and yet
	I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
