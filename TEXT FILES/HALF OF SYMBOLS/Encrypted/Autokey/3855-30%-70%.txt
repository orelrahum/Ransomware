Where now he sits at the right hand of bliss.
Thus, measuring things in Heaven by things on Earth,
At thy request, and that thou mayest beware
By what is past, to thee I have revealed
What might have else to human race been hid
The discord which befel, and war in Heaven
Among the angelick Powers, and the deep fall
Of those too high aspiring, who rebelled
With Satan he who envies now thy state,
Who now is plotting how he may seduce
Thee alsS JRZE CGVRUSOGH, BLNV, ABAH AEU
