    Manufacturing and tourism are the largest contributors to the economy.
    Manufacturing accounts for about 27 of GDP, with the electronics and
    textile industries major contributors. In 1990 inflation was held to a low

:Man, Isle of Economy

Overview:
    Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the economy.
    The governments policy of offering incentives to hightechnology companies
    and financial institutions to locate on the island has paid off in expanding
    employment opportunities in highincome industries. As a result, agriculture
    and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in their
    shares of GNP. Banking now contributes over 20 to GNP and manufacturing
    about 15. Trade is mostly with the UK.
