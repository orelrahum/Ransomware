The dismal gates, and barricadoed strong
But long ere our approaching heard within
Noise, other than the sound of dance or song,
Torment, and loud lament, and furious rage.
Glad we returned up to the coasts of light
Ere sabbathevening: so we had in charge.
But thy relation now for I attend,
Pleased with thy words no less than thou with mine.
So spake the GSWSMQS SZEOV, PBZ XYUF RNY MAFY.
