:Venezuela Economy

Overview:
    Petroleum is the cornerstone of the economy and accounted for 23 of GDP,

    office in February 1989. Lower tariffs and price supports, a free market
    exchange rate, and marketlinked interest rates threw the economy into

    recovered part way in 1990, and grew by 9.2 in 1991, led by the petroleum
    sector.
