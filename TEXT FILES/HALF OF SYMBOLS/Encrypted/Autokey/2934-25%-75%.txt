:Brazil Economy

Overview:
    The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors, entered
    the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an unserviceable
    foreign debt of 122 billion, and a lack of policy direction. In addition,
    the economy remained highly regulated, inwardlooking, and protected by
    substantial trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and
    mining facilities is divided among private interests  including several
    multinationals  and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are
    private, with the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts
    between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
    violence. The Collor government, which assumed office in March 1990, is
    embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to modernize and
    reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy,
    and opening it to increased foreign competition. The government in December
    1991 signed a letter of intent with the IMF for a 20month standby loan.
    Having reached an agreement on the repayment of interest arrears accumulated
    during 1989 and 1990, Brazilian officials and commercial bankers are engaged
    in talks on the reduction of medium and longterm debt and debt service
    payments and on the elimination of remaining interest arrears. A major
    longrun strength is Brazils vast natural resources.

:British Virgin Islands Economy

Overview:
    The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, is highly
    dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21 of the national
    income. In 1985 the government offered offshore registration to companies
    wishing to incorporate in the islands, and, in consequence, incorporation
    fees generated about 2 million in 1987. Livestock raising is the most
    significant agricultural activity. The islands crops, limited by poor
    soils, are unable to meet food requirements.

:Bulgaria Economy

Overview:
    Growth in the lackluster Bulgarian economy fell to the 2 annual level in
    the 1980s. By 1990, Sofias foreign debt had skyrocketed to over 10 billion
     giving a debtservice ratio of more than 40 of hard currency earnings and
    leading the regime to declare a moratorium on its hard currency payments.
    The postCommunist government faces major problems of renovating an aging
    industrial plant coping with worsening energy, food, and consumer goods
    shortages keeping abreast of rapidly unfolding technological developments
    investing in additional energy capacity the portion of electric power from
    nuclear energy reached over onethird in 1990 and motivating workers, in
    part by giving them a share in the earnings of their enterprises. Bulgarias
    new government, led by Prime Minister Filip Dimitrov, is strongly committed
    to economic reform. The previous government, even though dominated by former
    Communists, had taken the first steps toward dismantling the central
    planning system, bringing the economy back into balance, and reducing
    inflationary pressures. The program produced some encouraging early results,
    including eased restrictions on foreign investment, increased support from
    international financial institutions, and liberalized currency trading.
    Small entrepreneurs have begun to emerge and some privatization of small
    enterprises has taken place. The government has passed bills to privatize
    large stateowned enterprises and reform the banking system. Negotiations on
    an association agreement with the EC began in late 1991.

:Burma Economy

Overview:
    Burma is a poor Asian country, with a per capita GDP of about 500. The
    nation has been unable to achieve any substantial improvement in export
    earnings because of falling prices for many of its major commodity exports.
    For rice, traditionally the most important export, the drop in world prices
    has been accompanied by shrinking markets and a smaller volume of sales. In
    1985 teak replaced rice as the largest export and continues to hold this
    position. The economy is heavily dependent on the agricultural sector, which
    generates about 40 of GDP and provides employment for 65 of the work
    force. Burma has been largely isolated from international economic forces
    and has been trying to encourage foreign investment, so far with little
    success.

:Burundi Economy

Overview:
    A landlocked, resourcepoor country in an early stage of economic
    development, Burundi is predominately agricultural with only a few basic
    industries. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, which accounts
    for an average 90 of foreign exchange earnings each year. The ability to
    pay for imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the
    climate and the international coffee market. As part of its economic reform
    agenda, launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi
    is trying to diversify its export agriculture capability and attract foreign
    investment in industry. Several stateowned coffee companies were privatized
    via public auction in September 1991.

:Cambodia Economy

Overview:
    Cambodia is a desperately poor country whose economic development has been
    stymied by deadly political infighting. The economy is based on agriculture
    and related industries. Over the past decade Cambodia has been slowly
    recovering from its near destruction by war and political upheaval. The food
    situation remains precarious during the 1980s famine was averted only
    through international relief. In 1986 the production level of rice, the
    staple food crop, was able to meet only 80 of domestic needs. The biggest
    success of the nations recovery program has been in new rubber plantings
    and in fishing. Industry, other than rice processing, is almost nonexistent.
    Foreign trade has been primarily with the former USSR and Vietnam, and both
    trade and foreign aid are being adversely affected by the breakup of the
    USSR. Statistical data on the economy continue to be sparse and unreliable.
    Foreign aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has virtually stopped.

:Cameroon Economy

Overview:
    Because of its offshore oil resources, Cameroon has one of the highest
    incomes per capita in tropical Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious
    problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political
    instability, a topheavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate
    for business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led rapid
    economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 1986
    precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee,
    cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost onethird, and
    inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. In 199092, with support
    from the IMF and World Bank, the government has begun to introduce reforms
    designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture,
    and recapitalize the nations banks. Nationwide strikes organized by
    opposition parties in 1991, however, undermined these efforts.

:Canada Economy

Overview:
    As an affluent, hightech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles
    the US in per capita output, marketoriented economic system, and pattern of
    production. Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
    mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
    economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada
    registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations,
    averaging about 3.2. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force,
    and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. However,
    the continuing constitutional impasse between English and Frenchspeaking
    areas has observers discussing a possible split in the confederation
    foreign investors are becoming edgy.

:Cape Verde Economy

Overview:
    Cape Verdes low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base, a
    17year drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service oriented, with
    commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 65 of GDP during
    the period 198588. Although nearly 70 of the population lives in rural
    areas, agricultures share of GDP is only 16 the fishing sector accounts
    for 4. About 90 of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly
    lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only
    3.5 of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by
    remittances from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the
    new democratic government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the
    private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.

:Central African Republic Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture, including forestry, is the backbone of the CAR
    economy, with more than 70 of the population living in the countryside. In
    1988 the agricultural sector generated about 40 of GDP. Agricultural
    products accounted for about 60 of export earnings and the diamond industry
    for 30. The countrys 1991 budget deficit was US 70 million and in 1992 is
    expected to be about the same. Important constraints to economic development
    include the CARs landlocked position, a poor transportation system, and a
    weak human resource base. Multilateral and bilateral development assistance,
    particularly from France, plays a major role in providing capital for new
    investment.

:Chad Economy

Overview:
    The climate, geographic location, and lack of infrastructure and natural
    resources potential make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in
    the world. Its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war, conflict
    with Libya, drought, and food shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its
    1977 level, with cotton, the major cash crop, accounting for 48 of exports.
    Over 80 of the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing.
    Industry is based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural
    products, including cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly dependent
    on foreign aid, with its economy in trouble and many regions suffering from
    shortages. Oil companies are exploring areas north of Lake Chad and in the
    Doba basin in the south. Since coming to power in December 1990, the Deby
    government has experienced a year of economic chaos.

:Chile Economy

Overview:
    The government of President Aylwin, which took power in 1990, has opted to
    retain the orthodox economic policies of Pinochet, although the share of
    spending for social welfare has risen slightly. In 1991 growth in GDP
    recovered to 5.5 led by consumer spending after only 2.1 growth in 1990.
    The tight monetary policy of 1990 helped cut the rate of inflation from
    27.3 in 1990 to 18.7 in 1991. Despite a 12 drop in copper prices, the
    trade surplus rose in 1991, and international reserves increased.

    growth is likely to approach 7.
