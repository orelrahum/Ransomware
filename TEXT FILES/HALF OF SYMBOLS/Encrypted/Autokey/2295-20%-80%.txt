:Iceland Economy

Overview:
    Icelands prosperous Scandinaviantype economy is basically capitalistic,
    but with extensive welfare measures, low unemployment, and comparatively
    even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry, which provides nearly 75 of export earnings. In the absence of
    other natural resources, Icelands economy is vulnerable to changing world
    fish prices. The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
    in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
    plant. The conservative governments economic priorities include reducing
    the budget and current account deficits, containing inflation, revising
    agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and tying the
    krona to the ECs European currency unit in 1993. The fishing industries 
    notably the shrimp industry  are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
    mergers. Inflation has continued to drop sharply from 20 in 1989 to about
    7.5 in 1991 and possibly 3 in 1992, while unemployment is expected to
    increase to 2.5. GDP is KAEMUXBS XQ VSQMFCQG UP NGTSJL 4 MN 1992.
