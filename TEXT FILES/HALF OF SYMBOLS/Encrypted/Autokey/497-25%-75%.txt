Gryphon.  Do you know why its called a whiting?

  I never thought about it, said Alice.  Why?

  IT DOES THE BOOTS AND SHOES. the Gryphon replied very
solemnly.

  Alice was thoroughly puzzled.  Does the boots and shoes! she
repeated in a wondering tone.

  Why, what are YOUR shoes done with? said the Gryphon.  I
mean, what makes them so shiny?

  Alice looked down at them, and considered a little before she
gave her answer.  Theyre done with blacking, I believe.

  Boots and shoes under the sea, the Gryphon went on in a deep
voice, are done with a whiting.  Now you know.

  And what are they made of? Alice asked in a tone of great
curiosity.

  Soles and eels, of course, the Gryphon replied rather
impatiently:  any shrimp could have told you that.

  If Id been the whiting, said Alice, whose thoughts were
still running on the song, Id have said to the porpoise, "Keep
back, please:  we dont want YOU with us!"

  They were obliged to have him with them, the Mock Turtle
said:  no wise fish would go anywhere without a porpoise.

  Wouldnt it really? said Alice in a tone of great surprise.

  Of course not, said the Mock Turtle:  why, if a fish came
to ME, and told me he was going a journey, I should say "With
what porpoise?"

  Dont you mean "purpose"? said Alice.

  I mean what I say, the Mock Turtle replied in an offended
tone.  And the Gryphon added Come, lets hear some of YOUR
adventures.

  I could tell you my adventuresbeginning from this morning,
said Alice a little timidly:  but its no use going back to
yesterday, because I was a different person then.

  Explain all that, said the Mock Turtle.

  No, no!  The adventures first, said the Gryphon in an
impatient tone:  explanations take such a dreadful time.

  So Alice began telling them her adventures from the time when
she first saw the White Rabbit.  She was a little nervous about
it just at first, the two creatures got so close to her, one on
each side, and opened their eyes and mouths so VERY wide, but she
gained courage as she went on.  Her listeners were perfectly
quiet till she got to the part about her repeating YOU ARE OLD,
FATHER WILLIAM, to the Caterpillar, and the words all coming
different, and then the Mock Turtle drew a long breath, and said
Thats very curious.

  Its all about as curious as it can be, said the Gryphon.

  It all came different! the Mock Turtle repeated
thoughtfully.  I should like to hear her try and repeat
something now.  Tell her to begin.  He looked at the Gryphon as
if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.

  Stand up and repeat "TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD," said
the Gryphon.

  How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat
lessons! thought Alice I might as well be at school at once.
However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so
full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was
saying, and the words came very queer indeed:

    Tis the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare,
    "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
    As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.

              later editions continued as follows
    When the sands are all dry, he is gay as a lark,
    And will talk in contemptuous tones of the Shark,
    But, when the tide rises and sharks are around,
    His voice has a timid and tremulous sound.

  Thats different from what I used to say when I was a child,
said the Gryphon.

  Well, I never heard it before, said the Mock Turtle but it
sounds uncommon nonsense.

  Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her
hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way
again.

  I should like to have it explained, said the Mock Turtle.

  She cant explain it, said the Gryphon hastily.  Go on with
the next verse.

  But about his toes? the Mock Turtle persisted.  How COULD
he turn them out with his nose, you know?

  Its the first position in dancing. Alice said but was
dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the
subject.

  Go on with the next verse, the Gryphon repeated impatiently:
it begins "I passed by his garden."

  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would
all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:

    I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
    How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie

        later editions continued as follows
    The Panther took piecrust, and gravy, and meat,
    While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
    When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
    While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
    And concluded the banquet

  What IS the use of repeating all that stuff, the Mock Turtle
interrupted, if you dont explain it as you go on?  Its by far
the most confusing thing I ever heard!

  Yes, I think youd better leave off, said the Gryphon:  and
Alice was only too glad to do so.
