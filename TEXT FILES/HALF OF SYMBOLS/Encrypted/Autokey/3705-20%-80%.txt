And now without redemption all mankind
Must have been lost, adjudgd to Death and Hell
By doom severe, had not the Son of God,
In whom the fulness dwells of love divine,
His dearest mediation thus renewd.
Father, thy word is past, Man shall find grace
And shall grace not find means, that finds her way,
The speediest of thy winged messengers,
To visit all thy creatures, and to all
Comes unprevented, unimplord, unsought?
Happy for Man, so coming he her aid
Can never seek, once dead in sins, and lost
Atonement for himself, or offering meet,
Indebted and undone, hath none to bring
Behold me then:  me for him, life for life
I offer: on me let thine anger fall
Account me Man I for his sake will leave
 Thy bosom, and this glory next to thee
 Freely put off, and for him lastly die
 Well pleased on me let Death wreak all his rage.
 Under his gloomy power I shall not long
 Lie vanquished. Thou hast given me to possess
 Life in myself for ever by thee I live
 Though now to Death I yield, and am his due,
 All that of me can die, yet, that debt paid,
  thou wilt not leave me in the loathsome grave
 His prey, nor suffer mD ZRJBMNGWS GHNP
