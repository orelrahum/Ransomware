Wild work in Heaven, and dangerous to the main.
Two days are therefore past, the third is thine
For thee I have ordained it and thus far
Have suffered, that the glory may be thine
Of ending this great war, since none but Thou
Can end it.  Into thee such virtue and grace
Immense I have transfused, that all may know
In Heaven and Hell thy power above compare
And, this perverse commotion governed thus,
To manifest thee worthiest to be Heir
Of all things to be Heir, and to be King
By sacred unction, thy deserved right.
Go then, Thou Mightiest, in thy Fathers might
