TOUCHSTONE	When a mans verses cannot be understood, nor a
	mans good wit seconded with the forward child
	Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
	great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
	the gods had made thee poetical.

AUDREY	I do not know what poetical is: is it honest in
	deed and word? is it a true thing?

TOUCHSTONE	No, truly for the truest poetry is the most
	feigning and lovers are given to poetry, and what
	they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.

AUDREY	Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?

TOUCHSTONE	I do, truly for thou swearest to me thou art
	honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
	hope thou didst feign.

AUDREY	Would you not have me honest?

TOUCHSTONE	No, truly, unless thou wert hardfavoured for
	honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.

JAQUES	Aside  A material fool!

AUDREY	 Well, I am not fair and therefore I pray the gods
	make me honest.

TOUCHSTONE	Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
	were to put good meat into an unclean dish.

AUDREY	I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.

TOUCHSTONE	Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
	sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
	be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
	with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
	village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
	of the forest and to couple us.

JAQUES	Aside  I would fain see this meeting.

AUDREY	Well, thI RZWZ KOJH MY RJC!
