In bower and field he sought, where any tuft
Of grove or gardenplot more pleasant lay,
Their tendance, or plantation for delight
By fountain or by shady rivulet
He sought them both, but wished his hap might find
Eve separate he wished, but not with hope
Of what so seldom chanced when to his wish,
Beyond his hope, Eve separate he spies,
Veiled in a cloud of fragrance, where she stood,
Half spied, so thick the roses blushing round
About her glowed, oft stooping to support
Each flower of slender stalk, whose head, though gay
Carnation, purple, azure, or specked with gold,
Hung drooping unsustained them she upstays
Gently with myrtle band, mindless the while
Herself, though fairest unsupported flower,
From her best prop so far, and storm so nigh.
Nearer he drew, and many a walk traversed
