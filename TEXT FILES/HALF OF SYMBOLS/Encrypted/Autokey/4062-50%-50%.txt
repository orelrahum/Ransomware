An oliveleaf he brings, pacifick sign:
Anon dry ground appears, and from his ark
The ancient sire descends, with all his train
Then with uplifted hands, and eyes devout,
Grateful to Heaven, over his head beholds
A dewy cloud, and in the cloud a bow
Conspicuous with three lifted colours gay,
Betokening peace from God, and covenant new.
Whereat the heart of Adam, erst so sad,
Greatly rejoiced and thus his joy broke forth.
O thou, who future things canst represent
As preseCK, LWEIXUPY DRFEPCPLXI!  C TXZZDV
