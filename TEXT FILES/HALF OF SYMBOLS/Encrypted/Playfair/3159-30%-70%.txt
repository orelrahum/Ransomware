JAQUES	Nay, I care not for their names they owe me
	nothing. Will you sing?

AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself.

JAQUES	Well then, if ever I thank any man, Ill thank you
	but that they call compliment is like the encounter
	of two dogapes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
	the beggarly thanks. Come, sing and you that will
	not, hold your tongues.

AMIENS	Well, Ill end the song. Sirs, cover the while the
	duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
	this day to look KIO.
