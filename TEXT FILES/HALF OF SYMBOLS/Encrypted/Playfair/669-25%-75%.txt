Itself instinct with Spirit, but convoyed
By four Cherubick shapes four faces each
Had wonderous as with stars, their bodies all
And wings were set with eyes with eyes the wheels
Of beryl, and careering fires between
Over their heads a crystal firmament,
Whereon a sapphire throne, inlaid with pure
Amber, and colours of the showery arch.
He, in celestial panoply all armed
Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,
Ascended at his right hand Victory
Sat eaglewinged beside him hung his bow
And quiver with threebolted thunder stored
And from about him fierce effusion rolled
Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,
He onward came far off his coming shone
And twenty thousand I their number heard
Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen
He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,
Illustrious far and wide but by his own
First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised,
When the great ensign of Messiah blazed
Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven
Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced
His army, circumfused on either wing,
Under their Head imbodied all in one.
Before him Power Divine his way prepared
At his command the uprooted hills retired
Each to his place they heard his voice, and went
Obsequious Heaven his wonted face renewed,
And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.
This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,
And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
But to convince the proud what signs avail,
Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?
They, hardened more by what might most reclaim,
Grieving to see his glory, at the sight
Took envy and, aspiring to his highth,
Stood reembattled fierce, by force or fraud
Weening to prosper, and at length prevail
Against God and Messiah, or to fall
In universal ruin last and now
To final battle drew, disdaining flight,
Or faint retreat when the great Son of God
To all his host on either hand thus spake.
Stand still in bright array, ye Saints here stand,
Ye Angels armed this day from battle rest:
Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God
Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause
And as ye have received, so have ye done,
Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew
The punishment to other hand belongs
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:
Number to this days work is not ordained,
Nor multitude stand only, and behold
Gods indignation on these godless poured
By me not you, but me, they have despised,
Yet envied against me is all their rage,
Because the Father, to whom in Heaven spreme
Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains,
Hath honoured me, according to his will.
Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned
That they may have their wish, to try with me
In battle which the stronger proves they all,
Or I alone against them since by strength
They measure all, of other excellence
Not emulous, nor care who them excels
Nor other strife with them do I vouchsafe.
So spake the Son, and into terrour changed
His countenance too severe to be beheld,
And full of wrath bent on his enemies.
At once the Four spread out their starry wings
With dreadful shade contiguous, and the orbs
Of his fierce chariot rolled, as with the sound
Of torrent floods, or of a numerous host.
He on his impious foes right onward drove,
Gloomy as night under his burning wheels
The stedfast empyrean shook throughout,
All but the throne itself of God.  Full soon
Among them he arrived in his right hand
Grasping ten thousand thunders, which he sent
Before him, such as in their souls infixed
Plagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost,
All courage down their idle weapons dropt:
Oer shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,
That wished the mountains now might be again
Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
His arrows, from the fourfoldvisaged Four
Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes
One Spirit in them ruled and every eye
Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire
Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,
And of their wonted vigour left them drained,
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked
His thunder in mid volley for he meant
Not to destroy, but root them out of Heaven:
The overthrown he raised, and as a herd
Of goats or timorous flock together thronged
Drove them before him thunderstruck, pursued
With terrours, and with furies, to the bounds
And crystal wall of Heaven which, opening wide,
Rolled inward, and a spacious gap disclosed
Into the wasteful deep:  The monstrous sight
Struck them with horrour backward, but far worse
Urged them bSRUDR:  IQYNVUWP FRSHBASSKB PRSQ ZREYR
