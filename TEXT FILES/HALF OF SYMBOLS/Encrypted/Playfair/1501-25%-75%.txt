:Tunisia Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends primarily on petroleum, phosphates, tourism, and exports
    of light manufactures. Following two years of droughtinduced economic
    decline, the economy made a strong recovery in 1990 as a result of a
    bountiful harvest, continued export growth, and higher domestic investment.
    Continued high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular support for
    the government, however, and forced Tunis to slow the pace of economic
    reform. Nonetheless, the government appears committed to implementing its
    IMFsupported structural adjustment program and to servicing its foreign
    debt.
