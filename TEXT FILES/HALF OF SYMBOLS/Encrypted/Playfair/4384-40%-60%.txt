Overview:
    The economy, one of the worlds least developed, is based on agriculture and
    forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90 of the population and
    account for about 50 of GDP. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make
    the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The
    economy is closely aligned with that of India through strong trade and
    monetary links. Low wages in industry lead most Bhutanese to stay in
    agriculture. Most CKSASHZHQCF HEIHQRPB, LHRM EL WHKN WMRLPCMNGMUW, ESXA UW
