knee, and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some
meaning in them, after all.  "SAID I COULD NOT SWIM" you
cant swim, can you? he added, turning to the Knave.

  The Knave shook his head sadly.  Do I look like it? he said.
Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.

  All right, so far, said the King, and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself:  "WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE" thats
the jury, of course "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO" why,
that must be what he did with the tarts, you know

  But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU," said
Alice.

  Why, there they are! said the King triumphantly, pointing to
the tarts on the table.  Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
Then again"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT"  you never had fits, my
dear, I think? he said to the Queen.

  Never! said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke.  The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
mark but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.

  Then the words dont FIT you, said the King, looking round
the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.

  Its a pun! the King added in an offended tone, and
everybody laughed, Let the jury consider their verdict, the
King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

  No, no! said the Queen.  Sentence firstverdict afterwards.

  Stuff and nonsense! said Alice loudly.  The idea of having
the sentence first!

  Hold your tongue! said the Queen, turning purple.

  I wont! said Alice.
