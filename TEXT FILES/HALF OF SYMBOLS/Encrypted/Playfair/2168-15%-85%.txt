:El Salvador Economy

Overview:
    The agricultural sector accounts for 25 of GDP, employs about 40 of the
    labor force, and contributes about 66 to total exports. Coffee is the major
    commercial crop, accounting for 45 of export earnings. The manufacturing
    sector, based largely on food and beverage processing, accounts for 18 of
    GDP and 15 of employment. Economic losses because of guerrilla sabotage
    total more than 2 billion since 1979. The costs of maintaining a large
    military seriously constrain the governments efforts to provide essential
    social services. Nevertheless, growth in national output during the period
    199091 exceeded growth in population for the first time since 1987.
