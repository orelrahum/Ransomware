:GuineaBissau Economy

Overview:
    GuineaBissau ranks among the poorest countries in the world, with a per
    capita GDP below 200. Agriculture and fishing are the main economic
    activities. Cashew nuts, peanuts, and palm kernels are the primary exports.
    Exploitation of known mineral deposits is unlikely at present because of a
    weak infrastructure and the high cost of development. The governments
