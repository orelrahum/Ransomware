:Zaire Economy

Overview:
    In 1990, in spite of large mineral resources Zaire had a GDP per capita of
    only about 260, putting it among the desperately poor African nations. The
    countrys chronic economic problems worsened in 1991, with copper and cobalt
    production down 2030, inflation near 8,000 in 1991 as compared with 100
    in 198789, and IMF and most World Bank support suspended until the
    institution of agreedon changes. Agriculture, a key sector of the economy,
    employs 75 of the population but generates under 25 of GDP. The main
    potential for economic development has been the extractive industries.
    Mining and mineral processing account for about onethird of GDP and
    threequarters of total export earnings. Zaire is the worlds largest
    producer of diamonds and cobalt.
