Wrinkled the face of deluge, as decayed
And the clear sun on his wide watery glass
Gazed hot, and of the fresh wave largely drew,
As after thirst which made their flowing shrink
From standing lake to tripping ebb, that stole
With soft foot towards the deep who now had stopt
His sluces, as the Heaven his windows shut.

Fast on the top of some high mountain fixed.
And now the tops of hills, as rocks, appear
