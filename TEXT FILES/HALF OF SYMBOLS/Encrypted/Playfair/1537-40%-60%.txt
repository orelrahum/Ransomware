  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began
wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, I really must be

footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping
that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to

swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and
the little door, had vanished completely.
