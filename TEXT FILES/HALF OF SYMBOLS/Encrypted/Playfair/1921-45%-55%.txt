Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,
For death, like that which the Redeemer died.
All nations they shall teach for, from that day,
Not only to the sons of Abrahams loins
Salvation shall be preached, but to the sons
Of Abrahams faith wherever through the world
So in his seed all nations shall be blest.
Then to the Heaven of Heavens he shall ascend
With victory, triumphing through the air
Over his foes and thine there shall surprise
The Serpent, prince of air, and drag in chains
Through all his realm, and there confounded leave
Then enter into glory, and resume
His seat at Gods right hand, exalted high
Above all names in Heaven and thence shall come,
When this worlds dissolution shall be ripe,
With glory and power to judge both quick and dead
To judge the unfaithful dead, but to reward
His faithful, and receive them into bliss,
Whether in Heaven or Earth for then the Earth
Shall all be Paradise, far happier place
Than this of Eden, and far happier days.
So spake the ArchAngel Michael then paused,
As at the worlds great period and our sire,
Replete with joy and wonder, thus replied.
O Goodness infinite, Goodness immense!
That all this good of evil shall produce,
And evil turn to good more wonderful
Than that which by creation first brought forth
Light out of darkness!  Full of doubt I stand,
Whether I should repent me now of sin
By me done, and occasioned or rejoice
Much more, that much more good thereof shall spring
To God more glory, more goodwill to Men
From God, and over wrath grace shall abound.
