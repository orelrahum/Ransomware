    numbered about 900,000 in 1990. The small manufacturing sector includes
    textiles and clothing, beverage, food, and watch production. About 60 of
    the labor force works for the private sector and the rest for government.
    Most food and industrial goods are imported, with about 75 from the US. In
    1991 the unemployment rate was about 4.1.
