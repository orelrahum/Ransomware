    Since 1983 the economy has shown an impressive average annual growth rate of
    almost 5 because of strong agricultural and tourist sectors. Saint Lucia
    also possesses an expanding industrial base supported by foreign investment
    in manufacturing and other activities, such as in data processing. The
    economy, however, remains vulnerable because the important agricultural
    sector is dominated by banana production. Saint Lucia is subject to periodic
    droughts andor tropical storms, and its protected market agreement with the
    UK for bananas may end in 1992.
