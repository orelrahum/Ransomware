OLIVER	What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?

CHARLES	Marry, do I, sir and I came to acquaint you with a
	matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
	to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
	Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit and he that
	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
	well. Your brother is but young and tender and,
	for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
	must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
	out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
	withal, that either you might stay him from his
	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
	run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
	and altogether against my will.

OLIVER	Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
	thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
	myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and
	have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
	it, but he is resolutK. HXV PQXV PMYS, RMENSAB:
