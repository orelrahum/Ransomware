Surveyed, and sometimes went, and sometimes ran
With supple joints, as lively vigour led:
But who I was, or where, or from what cause,

Whateer I saw.  Thou Sun, said I, fair light,
And thou enlightened Earth, so fresh and gay,

And ye that live and move, fair Creatures, tell,

In goodness and in power preeminent:
Tell me, how may I know him, how adore,
From whom I have that thus I move and live,
And feel that I am happier than I know.
While thus I called, and strayed I knew not whither,
From where I first drew air, and first beheld
