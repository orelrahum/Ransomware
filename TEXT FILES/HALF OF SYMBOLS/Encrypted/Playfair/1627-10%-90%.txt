ROSALIND	Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
	wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a womans
	wit and it will out at the casement shut that and
	twill out at the keyhole stop that, twill fly
	with the smoke out at the chimney.

ORLANDO	A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
	Wit, whither wilt?

ROSALIND	Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
	your wifes wit going to your neighbours bed.

ORLANDO	And what wit could wit have to excuse that?

ROSALIND	Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
	never take her without her answer, unless you take
	her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
	make her fault her husbands occasion, let her
	never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
	it like a fool!

ORLANDO	For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.

ROSALIND	Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.

ORLANDO	I must attend the duke at dinner: by two oclock I
	will be with thee again.

ROSALIND	Ay, go your ways, go your ways I knew what you
	would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
	thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
	won me: tis but one cast away, and so, come,
	death! Two oclock is your hour?

ORLANDO	Ay, sweet Rosalind.

ROSALIND	By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
	me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
	if you break one jot of your promise or come one
	minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
	pathetical breakpromise and the most hollow lover
	and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
	may be chosen out of the gross band of the
	unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
	your promise.

ORLANDO	With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
	Rosalind: so adieu.

ROSALIND	Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
	offenders, and let Time try: KNHKO.
