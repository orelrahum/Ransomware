The Project Gutenberg Edition of THE WORLD FACTBOOK 1992:    January 1, 1993

This edition, as are all Project Gutenberg Editions, is Plain Vanilla ASCII,
meaning there are no characters other than what you would see on paper, thus
no page returns, no markup, nothing but the characters you would type if you
were to copy this from a book on a typewriter.  Repetitive paged headers and
trailing spaces are not present.  Leading spaces have been preserved in fact
sections for readability.

Mail subject headers can be searched with leading :s. . .such as:

:LUPILAHVFQD FYHPDEFOE
:LUPILAHVFQR FYHFSY
:LUPILAHVFQD FIXSECUARZ
:LUPILAHVFQD FIXSECUARZ
:LUPILAHVFQR AWMWUOQ
