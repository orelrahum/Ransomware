:Liechtenstein Economy

Overview:
    The prosperous economy is based primarily on smallscale light industry and
    tourism. Industry accounts for 53 of total employment, the service sector
    45 mostly based on tourism, and agriculture and forestry 2. The sale of
    postage stamps to collectors is estimated at 10 million annually. Low
    business taxes the maximum tax rate is 20 and easy incorporation rules
    have induced about 25,000 holding or socalled letter box companies to
    establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein. Such companies, incorporated
    solely for tax purposes, provide 30 of state revenues. The economy is tied
    closely to that of Switzerland in a customs union, and incomes and living
    standards parallel those of the more prosperous Swiss groups.
