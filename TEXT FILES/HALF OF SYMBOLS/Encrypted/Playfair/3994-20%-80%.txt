To me, who with eternal famine pine,
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven
There best, where most with ravine I may meet
Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems
To stuff this maw, this vast unhidebound corps.

Feed first on each beast next, and fish, and fowl
No homely morsels! and, whaFKSSE PMUDZ
