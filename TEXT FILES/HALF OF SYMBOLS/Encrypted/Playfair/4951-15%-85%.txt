:Georgia Economy

Overview:
    Among the former Soviet republics, Georgia is noted for its Black Sea
    tourist industry, its large output of citrus fruits and tea, and the amazing
    diversity of an industrial sector that accounted, however, for less than 2
    of the USSRs output. Another salient characteristic of the economy has been
    a flourishing private sector compared with the other republics. Almost 30
    of the labor force is employed in agriculture and 18 in industry. Mineral
    resources consist of manganese and copper, and, to a lesser extent,
    molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury. Except for very small quantities
    of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must be imported from neighboring
    republics. Oil and its products are delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to
    the port of Batumi for export and local refining. Gas is supplied in
    pipelines from Krasnodar and Stavropol. Georgia is nearly selfsufficient
    in electric power, thanks to abMWRLAP MKWWHZHRYE PFQGMUWL EX RASF LB VIUY
