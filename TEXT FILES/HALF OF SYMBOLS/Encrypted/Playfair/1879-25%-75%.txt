Had it been only coveting to eye
That sacred fruit, sacred to abstinence,
Much more to taste it under ban to touch.
But past who can recall, or done undo?
Not God Omnipotent, nor Fate yet so
Perhaps thou shalt not die, perhaps the fact
Is not so heinous now, foretasted fruit,
Profaned first by the serpent, by him first
Made common, and unhallowed, ere our taste
Nor yet on him found deadly yet he lives
Lives, as thou saidst, and gains to live, as Man,
Higher degree of life inducement strong
To us, as likely tasting to attain
Proportional ascent which cannot be
But to be Gods, or Angels, demiGods.
Nor can I think that God, Creator wise,
Though threatening, will in earnest so destroy
Us his prime creatures, dignified so high,
Set over all his works which in our fall,
For us created, needs with us must fail,
Dependant made so God shall uncreate,
Be frustrate, do, undo, and labour lose
Not well conceived of God, who, though his power
Creation could repeat, yet would be loth
Us to abolish, lest the Adversary
Triumph, and say "Fickle their state whom God
"Most favours who can please him long? Me first
"He ruined, now Mankind whom will he next?"
Matter of scorn, not to be given the Foe.
However I with thee have fixed my lot,
Certain to undergo like doom:  If death
Consort with thee, death is to me as life
So forcible within my heart I feel
The bond of Nature draw me to my own
My own in thee, for what thou art is mine
Our state cannot be severed we are one,
One flesh to lose thee were to lose myself.
So Adam and thus Eve to him replied.
O glorious trial of exceeding love,
Illustrious evidence, example high!
Engaging me to emulate but, short
Of thy perfection, how shall I attain,
Adam, from whose dear side I boast me sprung,
And gladly of our union hear thee speak,
One heart, one soul in both whereof good proof
This day affords, declaring thee resolved,
Rather than death, or aught than death more dread,
