  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the
first really clever thing the King had said that day.

  That PROVES his guilt, said the Queen.

  It proves nothing of the sort! said Alice.  Why, you dont
even know what theyre about!

  Read them, said the King.

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  Where shall I begin,
