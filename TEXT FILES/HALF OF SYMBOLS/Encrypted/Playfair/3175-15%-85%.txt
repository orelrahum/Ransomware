SCENE II	The forest.


	Enter ORLANDO, with a paper

ORLANDO	Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
	And thou, thricecrowned queen of night, survey
	With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
	Thy huntress name that my full life doth sway.
	O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
	And in their barks my thoughts Ill character
	That every eye which in this forest looks
	Shall see thy virtue witnessd every where.
	Run, run, Orlando carve on every tree
	The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.

	Exit

	Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

	it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
	like it very well but in respect that it is
	private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
	is in the fields, it pleaseth me well but in
	respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
	is it a spare life, look you, it fits my hOUIOC DASX
