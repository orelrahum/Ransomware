From penalty, because from death released
Some days: how long, and what till then our life,
Who knows? or more than this, that we are dust,
And thither must return, and be no more?
Why else this double object in our sight
Of flight pursued in the air, and oer the ground,
One way the selfsame hour? why in the east
Darkness ere days midcourse, and morninglight
More orient in yon western cloud, that draws
Oer the blue firmament a radiant white,
And slow descends with something heavenly fraught?
He erred not for by this the heavenly bands
Down from a sky of jasper lighted now
In Paradise, and on a hill made halt
A glorious apparition, had not doubt
And carnal fear that day dimmed Adams eye.
