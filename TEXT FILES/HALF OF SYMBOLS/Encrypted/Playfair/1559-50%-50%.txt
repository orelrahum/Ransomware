was evidently meant for her.

  Yes! shouted Alice.

  Come on, then! roared the Queen, and Alice joined the
procession, wondering very much what would happen next.

  Itsits a very fine day! said a timid voice at her side.
She was walking by the White Rabbit, who was peeping anxiously
into her face.

  Very, said Alice:  wheres the Duchess?

  Hush!  Hush! said the Rabbit in a low, hurried tone.  He
looked anxiously over his shoulder as he spoke, and then raised
himself upon tiptoe, put his mouth close to her ear, and
whispered Shes under sentence of execution.

  What for? said Alice.

  Did you say "What a pity!"? the Rabbit asked.

  No, I didnt, said Alice:  I dont think its at all a pity.
I said "What for?"

  She boxed the Queens ears the Rabbit began.  Alice gave a
little scream of laughter.  Oh, hush! the Rabbit whispered in a
frightened tone.  The Queen will hear you!  You see, she came
rather late, and the Queen said

  Get to your places! shouted the Queen in a voice of thunder,
and people began running about in all directions, tumbling up
against each other however, they got settled down in a minute or
two, and the game began.  Alice thought she had never seen such a
curious croquetground in her life it was all ridges and
furrows the balls were live hedgehogs, the mallets live
flamingoes, and the soldiers had to double themselves up and to
stand on their hands and feet, to make the archSB.
