Common revenge, and interrupt his joy
In our confusion, and our joy upraise
In his disturbance when his darling sons,
Hurled headlong to partake with us, shall curse
Their frail original, and faded bliss
Faded so soon! Advise if this be worth
Attempting, or to sit in darkness here
Hatching vain empires." Thus beelzebub
Pleaded his devilish counselfirst devised
By Satan, and in part proposed: for whence,
But from the author of all ill, could spring
So deep a malice, to confound the race
Of mankind in one root, and Earth with Hell
To mingle and involve, done all to spite
The great Creator? But their spite still serves
His glory to augment. The bold design
Pleased highly those infernal States, and joy
