Under their Godlike leaders, in the cause
Of God and his Messiah.  On they move
Indissolubly firm nor obvious hill,
Nor straitening vale, nor wood, nor stream, divides
Their perfect ranks for high above the ground
Their march was, and the passive air upbore
Their nimble tread as when the total kind
Of birds, in orderly array on wing,
Came summoned over Eden to receive
Their names of thee so over many a tract
Of Heaven they marched, and many a province wide,
Tenfold the length of this terrene:  At last,
Far in the horizon to the north appeared
From skirt to skirt a fiery region, stretched
In battailous aspect, and nearer view
Bristled with upright beams innumerable
Of rigid spears, and helmets thronged, and shields
Various, with boastful argument portrayed,
The banded Powers of Satan hasting on
With furious expedition for they weened
That selfsame day, by fight or by surprise,
To win the mount MZ PIW, LAW IR UHV PMWHRA
