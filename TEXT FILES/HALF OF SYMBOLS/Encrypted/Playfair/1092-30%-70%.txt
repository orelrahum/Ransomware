:Norfolk Island Economy

Overview:
    The primary economic activity is tourism, which has brought a level of
    prosperity unusual among inhabitants of the Pacific Islands. The number of
    visitors has increased steadily over the years and reached 29,000 in FY89.
    Revenues from tourism have given the island a favorable balance of trade and
    helped the agricultural sector to become selfsufficient in the production
    of beef, poultry, and eggs.
