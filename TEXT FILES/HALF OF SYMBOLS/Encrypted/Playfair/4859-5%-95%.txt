    the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the
    allimportant fishing industry and with an external debt twice the size of
    annual income. When the nations of the world extended their fishing zones to
    200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no longer could continue
    their traditional longdistance fishing and subsequently depleted their own
    nearby fishing areas. The governments tight controls on fish stocks and its
    austerity measures have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will force
    further reductions in the fishing industry, which has already been plagued
    with bankrupcies. An annual Danish subsidy of 140 million continues to
    provide roughly onethird of the islands budget revenues.
