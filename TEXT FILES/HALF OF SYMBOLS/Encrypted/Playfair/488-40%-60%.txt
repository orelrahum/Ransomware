            "Up above the world you fly,
            Like a teatray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle"

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle and went on so long that
they had to pinch it to make it stop.

  Well, Id hardly finished the first verse, said the Hatter,
when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "Hes murdering the
time!  Off with his head!"

  How dreadfully savage! exclaimed Alice.

  And ever since that, the Hatter went on in a mournful tone,
he wont do a thing I ask!  Its always six oclock now.

  A bright idea came into Alices head.  Is that the reason so
many teathings are put out here? she asked.

  Yes, thats it, said the Hatter with a sigh:  its always
teatime, and weve no time to wash the things between whiles.

  Then you keep moving round, I suppose? said Alice.

  Exactly so, said the Hatter:  as the things get used up.

  But what happens when you come to the beginning again? Alice
ventured to ask.

  Suppose we change the subject, the March Hare interrupted,
yawning.  Im getting tired of this.  I vote the young lady
tells us a story.

  Im afraid I dont know one, said Alice, rather alarmed at
the proposal.

  Then the Dormouse shall! they both cried.  Wake up,
Dormouse!  And they pinched it on both sides at once.

  The Dormouse slowly opened his eyes.  I wasnt asleep, he
said in a hoarse, feeble voice:  I heard every word you fellows
were saying.

  Tell us a story! said the March Hare.

  Yes, please do! pleaded Alice.

  And be quick about it, added the Hatter, or youll be asleep
again before its done.

  Once upon a time there were three little sisters, the
Dormouse began in a great hurry and their names were Elsie,
Lacie, and Tillie and they lived at the bottom of a well

  What did they live on? said Alice, who always took a great
interest in questions of eating and drinking.

  They lived on treacle, said the Dormouse, after thinking a
minute or two.

  They couldnt have done that, you know, Alice gently
remarked theyd have been ill.

  So they were, said the Dormouse VERY ill.

  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways
of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went
on:  But why did they live at the bottom of a well?

  Take some more tea, the March Hare said to Alice, very
earnestly.

  Ive had nothing yet, Alice replied in an offended tone, so
I cant take more.

  You mean you cant take LESS, said the Hatter:  its very
easy to take MORE than nothing.

  Nobody asked YOUR opinion, said Alice.

  Whos making personal remarks now? the Hatter asked
triumphantly.

  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped
herself to some tea and breadandbutter, and then turned to the
Dormouse, and repeated her question.  Why did they live at the
bottom of a well?

  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and
then said, It was a treaclewell.

  Theres no such thing!  Alice was beginning very angrily, but
the Hatter and the March Hare went Sh! sh! and the Dormouse
sulkily remarked, If you cant be civil, youd better finish the
story for yourself.

  No, please go on! Alice said very humbly I wont interrupt
again.  I dare say there may be ONE.

  One, indeed! said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he
consented to go on.  And so these three little sistersthey
were learning to draw, you know

  What did they draw? said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

  Treacle, said the Dormouse, without considering at all this
time.

  I want a clean cup, interrupted the Hatter:  lets all move
one place on.

  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the
March Hare moved into the Dormouses place, and Alice rather
unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the
only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a
good deal worPY HZL PMLA SQZUES, EL PMQ HENRM UEES UEK DHLF MHPQP
