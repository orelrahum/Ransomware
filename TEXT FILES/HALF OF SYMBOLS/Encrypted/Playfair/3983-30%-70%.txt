By Eve, though all unweeting, seconded
Upon her husband saw their shame that sought
Vain covertures but when he saw descend
The Son of God to judge them, terrified
He fled not hoping to escape, but shun
The present fearing, guilty, what his wrath
Might suddenly inflict that past, returned
By night, and listening where the hapless pair
Sat in their sad discourse, and various plaint,
Thence gathered his own doom which understood
Not instant, but of future time, with joy
And tidings fraught, to Hell he now returned
And at the brink of Chaos, near the foot
Of this new wonderous pontifice, unhoped
Met, who to meet him came, his offspring KQYW.
