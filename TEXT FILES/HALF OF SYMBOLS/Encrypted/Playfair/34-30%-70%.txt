:Andorra Economy

Overview:
    The mainstay of Andorras economy is tourism. An estimated 13 million
    tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorras dutyfree status and by its
    summer and winter resorts. Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity
    of arable land, and most food has to be imported. The principal livestock
    activity is sheep raising. Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes,
    cigars, and furniture. The rapid pace of European economic integration is a
    potential threat to Andorras advantages from its dutyfree status.

:Angola Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 8090 of the
    population, but accounts for less than 15 of GDP. Oil production is vital
    to the economy, contributing about 60 to GDP. In recent years, a bitter
    internal war has severely affected the nonoil economy, and food has to be
    imported. For the long run, Angola has the advantage of rich natural
    resources in addition to oil, notably gold, diamonds, and arable land. To
    realize its economic potential Angola not only must secure domestic peace
    but also must reform government policies that have led to distortions and
    imbalances throughout the economy.
