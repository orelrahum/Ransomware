:Solomon Islands Economy

Overview:
    About 90 of the population depend on subsistence agriculture, fishing, and
    forestry for at least part of their livelihood. Agriculture, fishing, and
    forestry contribute about 70 to GDP, with the fishing and forestry sectors
    being important export earners. The service sector contributes about 25 to
    GDP. Most manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. The
    islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, zinc,
    nickel, and gold. The economy suffered from a severe cyclone in mid1986
    that caused widespread damage to the infrastructure.
