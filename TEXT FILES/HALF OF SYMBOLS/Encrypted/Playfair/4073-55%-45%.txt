Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea
Swallows him with his host but them lets pass,
As on dry land, between two crystal walls
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand
Divided, till his rescued gain their shore:
Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend,
Though present in his Angel who shall go
Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire
