Such were these giants, men of high renown
For in those days might only shall be admired,
And valour and heroick virtue called
To overcome in battle, and subdue
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
Manslaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
Of human glory and for glory done
Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours
Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods
Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.
Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth
And what most merits fame, in silence hid.
But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
The only righteous in a world preverse,
And therefore hated, therefore so beset
With foes, for daring single to be just,
And utter odious truth, that God would come
To judge them with his Saints him the Most High
Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds
Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God
High in salvation and the climes of bliss,
Exempt from death to show thee what reward
Awaits the good the rest what punishment
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.
He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed
