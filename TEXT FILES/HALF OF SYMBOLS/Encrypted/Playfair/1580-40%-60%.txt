little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:

  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her
voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyesand
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
sisters dream.

  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
bythe frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their neverending meal,
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the
Duchesss knee, while plates and dishes crashed around itonce
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizards
slatepencil, and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle.

  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only
rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep
bells, and the Queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boyand the sneeze of the baby, PMS PREHKY IZ FRS PDEZMIA, LWR
