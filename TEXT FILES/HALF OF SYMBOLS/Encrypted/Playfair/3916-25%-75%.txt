Beyond the Earths green Cape and verdant Isles
Hesperian sets, my signal to depart.
Be strong, live happy, and love!  But, first of all,

Would not admit: thine, and of all thy sons,
The weal or woe in thee is placed beware!

Free in thine own arbitrement it lies.
Perfect within, no outward aid require
And all temptation to transgress repel.

Followed with benediction.  Since to part,
