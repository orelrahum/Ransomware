    billion external debt is owed to the United States, which is its major
    source of economic and military aid. To earn needed foreign exchange, Israel
    has been targeting hightechnology niches in international markets, such as
    medical scanning equipment. Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 dealt a
    blow to Israels economy. Higher world oil prices added an estimated 300
    million to the oil import bill that year and helped keep annual inflation at
    18. Regional tension and the continuing Palestinian uprising intifadah
    have contributed to a sharp drop in tourism  a key foreign exchange earner
     to the lowest level since the 1973 ArabIsraeli war. The influx of Jewish
    immigrants from the former USSR, which topped 330,000 during the period
    199091, will increase unemployment, intensify housing problems, widen the
    government budget deficit, and fuel inflation.
