And send thee from the garden forth to till
The ground whence thou wast taken, fitter soil.
He added not for Adam at the news
Heartstruck with chilling gripe of sorrow stood,
That all his senses bound Eve, who unseen
Yet all had heard, with audible lament
Discovered soon the place of her retire.
O unexpected stroke, worse than of Death!
Must I thus leave thee Paradise? thus leave
Thee, native soil! these happy walks and shades,
Fit haunt of Gods? where I had hope to spend,
Quiet though sad, the respite of that day
That must be mortal to us both.  O flowers,
That never will in other climate grow,
My early visitation, and my last
 t even, which I bred up with tender hand
From the first opening bud, and gave ye names!
