    force. Once a mainly agricultural area, it now supplies important producer
    and consumer goods  sometimes as the sole producer  to the other states.
    The soil in Belarus is not as fertile as the black earth of Ukraine, but by
    emphasizing favorable crops and livestock especially pigs and chickens,
    Belarus has become a net exporter to the other republics of meat, milk,
    eggs, flour, and potatoes. Belarus produces only small amounts of oil and
    gas and receives most of its fuel from Russia through the Druzhba oil
    pipeline and the Northern Lights gas pipeline. These pipelines transit
    Belarus enroute to Eastern Europe. Belarus produces petrochemicals,
    plastics, synthetic fibers nearly 30 of former Soviet output, and
    fertilizer 20 of former Soviet output. Raw material resources are limited
    to potash and peat deposits. The peat more than onethird of the total for
    the former Soviet Union is used in domestic heating as boiler fuel for
