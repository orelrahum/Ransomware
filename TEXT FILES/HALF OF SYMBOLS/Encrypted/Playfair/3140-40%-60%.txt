ACT II



SCENE I	The Forest of Arden.


	Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,
	like foresters

DUKE SENIOR	Now, my comates and brothers in exile,
	Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
	Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
	More free from peril than the envious court?
	Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
	The seasons difference, as the icy fang
	And churlish chiding of the winters wind,
	Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
	Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
