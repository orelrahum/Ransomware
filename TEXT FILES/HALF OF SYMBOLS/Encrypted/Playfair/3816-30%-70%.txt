Book VI


All night the dreadless Angel, unpursued,
Through Heavens wide champain held his way till Morn,
Waked by the circling Hours, with rosy hand
Unbarred the gates of light.  There is a cave
Within the mount of God, fast by his throne,
Where light and darkness in perpetual round
Lodge and dislodge by turns, which makes through Heaven
Grateful vicissitude, like day and night
Light issues forth, and at the other door
Obsequious darkness enters, till her hour
To veil the Heaven, though darkness there UHPIZ CASX
