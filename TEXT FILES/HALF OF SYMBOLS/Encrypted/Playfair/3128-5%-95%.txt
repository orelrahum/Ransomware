	I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
	Ere he should thus have ventured.

CELIA	Gentle cousin,
	Let us go thank him and encourage him:
	My fathers rough and envious disposition
	Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
	If you do keep your promises in love
	But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
	Your mistress shall be happy.

ROSALIND	Gentleman,

	Giving him a chain from her neck

	Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
	That could give more, but that her hand lacks HQLAB.
	PRLFX NK PM, WWO?
