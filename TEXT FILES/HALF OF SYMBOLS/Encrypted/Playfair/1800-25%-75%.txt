Swift to their several quarters hasted then
The cumbrous elements, earth, flood, air, fire
And this ethereal quintessence of Heaven
Flew upward, spirited with various forms,
That rolled orbicular, and turned to stars
Numberless, as thou seest, and how they move
Each had his place appointed, each his course
The rest in circuit walls this universe.
Look downward on that globe, whose hither side
With light from hence, though but reflected, shines
That place is Earth, the seat of Man that light
His day, which else, as the other hemisphere,
Night would invade but there the neighbouring moon
So call that opposite fair star her aid
Timely interposes, and her monthly round
Still ending, still renewing, through mid Heaven,
With borrowed light her countenance triform
Hence fills and empties to enlighten the Earth,
And in her pale dominion checks the night.
That spot, to which I point, is Paradise,
Adams abode those lofty shades, his bower.
Thy way thou canst not miss, me mine requires.
Thus said, he turned and Satan, bowing low,
As to superiour Spirits is wont in Heaven,
Where honour due and reverence none neglects,
Took leave, and toward the coast of earth beneath,
Down from the ecliptick, sped with hoped success,
Throws his steep flight in many an aery wheel
Nor staid, till on Niphates top he lights.

The Apocalypse, heard cry in Heaven aloud,
Then when the Dragon, put to second rout,
Came furious down to be revenged on men,
Woe to the inhabitants on earth! that now,
While time was, our first parents had been warned
The coming of their secret foe, and scaped,
Haply so scaped his mortal snare:  For now
Satan, now first inflamed with rage, came down,
The tempter ere the accuser of mankind,
To wreak on innocent frail Man his loss
Of that first battle, and his flight to Hell:
Yet, not rejoicing in his speed, thougM SUXW
