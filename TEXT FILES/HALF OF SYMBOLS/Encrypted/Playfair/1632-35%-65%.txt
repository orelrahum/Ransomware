	But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
	And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
	Made him give battle to the lioness,
	Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
	From miserable slumber I awaked.

CELIA	Are you his brother?

ROSALIND	Wast you he rescued?

CELIA	Wast you that did so oft contrive to kill him?

OLIVER	Twas I but tis not I	I do not shame
	To tell you what I was, since my conversion
	So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.

ROSALIND	But, for the bloody napkin?

OLIVER	By and by.
	When from the first to last betwixt us two
	Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
	As how I came into that desert place:
	In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
	Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
	Committing me unto my brothers love
	Who led me instantly unto his cave,
	There strippd himself, and here upon his arm
	The lioness had torn some flesh away,
	Which all this while had bled and now he fainted
	And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
	Brief, I recoverd him, bound up his wound
	And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
	He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
	To tell this story, that you might excuse
	His broken promise, and to give this napkin
	Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
	That he in sport doth call his RosaVUWR.
