and agonizing policy question for LC  Re the issue of electronic
deposit, LC urged to initiate a catalytic process in terms of distributed
responsibility  Suggestions for cooperative ventures  Commercial
publishers fears  Strategic questions for getting the image and text
people to think through longterm cooperation  Clarification of the
driving force behind both the Perseus and the Cornell Xerox projects 


In his role as moderator of the concluding session, GIFFORD raised two
questions he believed would benefit from discussion:  1 Are there enough
commonalities among those of us that have been here for two days so that
we can see courses of action that should be taken in the future?  And, if
so, what are they and who might take them?  2 Partly derivative from
that, but obviously very dangerous to LC as host, do you see a role for
the Library of Congress in all this?  Of course, the Library of Congress
holds a rather special status in a number of these matters, because it is
not perceived as a player with an economic stake in them, but are there
roles that LC can play that can help advance us toward where we are heading?

Describing himself as an uninformed observer of the technicalities of the
last two days, GIFFORD detected three different emphases in the Workshop:
