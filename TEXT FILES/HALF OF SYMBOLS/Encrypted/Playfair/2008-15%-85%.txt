:Belgium Economy

Overview:
    This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its central
    geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified
    industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in the
    populous Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging
    reinvestment in the southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources
    Belgium must import essential raw materials, making its economy closely
    dependent on the state of world markets. HSKW 70 HZ FNERK HV DOPM MZRSE SW
