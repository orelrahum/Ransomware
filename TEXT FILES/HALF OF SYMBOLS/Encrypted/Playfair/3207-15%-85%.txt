CELIA	An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.

ROSALIND	And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
	of holy bread.

CELIA	He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
	of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiously
	the very ice of chastity is in them.

ROSALIND	But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
	comes not?

CELIA	Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.

ROSALIND	Do you think so?

CELIA	Yes I think he is not a pickpurse nor a
	horsestealer, but for his verity in love, I do
	think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
	wormeaten nut.

ROSALIND	Not true in love?

CELIA	Yes, when he is in but I think he is not in.

ROSALIND	You have heard him sRYEN WIDWDHPIP MY REL.
