:Switzerland Economy

Overview:
    Switzerlands economic success is matched in few other nations. Per capita
    output, general living standards, education and science, health care, and
    diet are unsurpassed in Europe. Economic stability helps promote the
    important banking and tourist sectors. Since World War II, Switzerlands
    economy has adjusted smoothly to the great changes in output and trade
    patterns in Europe and presumably can adjust to the challenges of the 1990s,
    particularly to the further economic integration of Western Europe and the
    amazingly rapid changes in East European political and economic prospects.
    After 8 years of growth, the economy experienced a mild recession in 1991
    because monetary policy was tightened to combat inflation and because of the
    weak international economy. In the second half of 1992, however, Switzerland
    is expected to resume growth, despite inflation and unemployment problems.
    GDP growth for 1992 may be just under 1, inflation should drop from 5.9 to
    3.5, and the trade deficit will continue to decline after dropping by over
    15 to 5 billion, due to increased exports to Germany. Unemployment,
    however, is forecast to rise to 1.6 in 1992, up from 1.3 in 1991 and 0.5
    in 1990.
