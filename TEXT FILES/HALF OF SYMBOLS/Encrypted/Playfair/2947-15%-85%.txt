  Either the well was very deep, or she fell very slowly, for she
had plenty of time as she went down to look about her and to
wonder what was going to happen next.  First, she tried to look
down and make out what she was coming to, but it was too dark to
see anything then she looked at the sides of the well, and
noticed that they were filled with cupboards and bookshelves
here and there she saw maps and pictures hung upon pegs.  She
took down a jar from one of the shelves as she passed it was
labelled ORANGE MARMALADE, but to her great disappointment it
was empty:  she did not like to drop the jar for fear of killing
somebody, so managed to put it into one of the cupboards as she
fell past it.

  Well! thought Alice to herself, after such a fall as this, I
shall think nothing of tumbling down stairs!  How brave theyll
all think me at home!  Why, I wouldnt say anything about it,
even if I fell off the top of the house! Which was very likely
true.

  Down, down, down.  Would the fall NEVER come to an end!  I
wonder how many miles Ive fallen by this time? she said aloud.
I must be getting somewhere near the centre of the earth.  Let
me see:  that would be four thousand miles down, I think for,
you see, Alice had learnt several things of this sort in her
lessons in the schoolrooU, LAC GMIIFM PMHX REL WUF Q SKWE ZIIW
