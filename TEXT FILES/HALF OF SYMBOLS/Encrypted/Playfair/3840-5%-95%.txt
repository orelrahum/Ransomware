Up rose the victorAngels, and to arms
The matin trumpet sung:  In arms they stood
Of golden panoply, refulgent host,

Look round, and scouts each coast lightarmed scour,
Each quarter to descry the distant foe,
Where lodged, or whither fled, or if for fight,
In motion or in halt:  Him soon they met
Under spread ensigns moving nigh, in slow
But firm battalion bQDQ DOPM PHYSKDSPP BKUX
