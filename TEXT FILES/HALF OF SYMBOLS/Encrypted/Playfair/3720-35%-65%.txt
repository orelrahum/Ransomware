To darkness, such as bound the ocean wave.
Satan from hence, now on the lower stair,
That scaled by steps of gold to Heavengate,
Looks down with wonder at the sudden view
Of all this world at once.  As when a scout,
Through dark?nd desart ways with?oeril gone
All?might,?t?kast by break of cheerful dawn
Obtains the brow of some highclimbing hill,
Which to his eye discovers unaware
The goodly prospect of some foreign land
First seen, or some renowned metropolis
With glistering spires and pinnacles adorned,
Which now the rising sun gilds with his beams:
Such wonder seised, though after Heaven seen,
The Spirit malign, but much more envy seised,
At sight of all this world beheld so fair.
Round he surveys and well might, where he stood
So high above the circling canopy
Of nights extended shade, from eastern point
Of Libra to the fleecy star that bears
Andromeda far off Atlantick seas
Beyond the horizon then from pole ZM ZHSA
