Overview:
    In 1991 the economy grew at an estimated 2.5, down somewhat from the 3.6
    gain of 1990 and below the strong 5.5 gain of 1989. Increases in
    agricultural production on the strength of good coffee and banana crops
    and in construction have been offset by lower rates of growth for industry.
    In 1991 consumer prices rose by 27, about the same as in 1990. The trade
    deficit of 270 million was substantially below the 1990 dKGUDMZ MZ 677
