volumes eventually will be added to the CDROM edition, pending
negotiations with the publishers of the papers.  At the moment, the
Founding Fathers CDROM is accessible only on the IBYCUS, a computer
developed out of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae project and designed for
the use of classical scholars.  There are perhaps 400 IBYCUS computers in
the country, most of which are in university classics departments.
Ultimately, it is anticipated that the CDROM edition of the Founding
Fathers documents will run on any IBMcompatible or Macintosh computer
with a CDROM drive.  Numerous changes in the software will also occur
before the project is completed.  Editors note: an IBYCUS was
unavailable to demonstrate the CDROM.
