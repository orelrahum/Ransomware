:Central African Republic Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture, including forestry, is the backbone of the CAR
    economy, with more than 70 of the population living in the countryside. In
    1988 the agricultural sector generated about 40 of GDP. Agricultural
    products accounted for about 60 of export earnings and the diamond industry
    for 30. The countrys 1991 budget deficit was US 70 million and in 1992 is
    expected to be about the same. Important constraints to economic development
    include the CARs landlocked position, a poor transportation system, and a
    weak human resource base. Multilateral and bilateral development assistance,
    particularly from France, plays a major role in providing capital for new
    investment.
