:Somalia Economy

Overview:
    One of the worlds poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has few
    resources. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, with the
    livestock sector accounting for about 40 of GDP and about 65 of export
    earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for their
    livelihoods make up more than half of the population. Crop production
    generates only 10 of GDP and employs about 20 of the work force. The main
    export crop is bananas sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic
    market. The small industrial sector is based on the processing of
    agricultural products and accounts for less than 10 of GDP. Greatly
    increased political turmoil in 199192 has resulted in a substantial drop in
    output, with widespread famine a grim fact of life.
