And, to the faithful, death the gate of life
Taught this by his example, whom I now
Acknowledge my Redeemer ever blest.
To whom thus also the Angel last replied.
This having learned, thou hast attained the sum
Of wisdom hope no higher, though all the stars
Thou knewest by name, and all the ethereal powers,
All secrets of the deep, all Natures works,
Or works of God in Heaven, air, earth, or sea,
And all the riches of this world enjoyedst,
And all the rule, one empire only add

Add virtue, patience, temperance add love,
By name to come called charity, the soul
Of all the rest: then wilt thou WUM TA SMZO
