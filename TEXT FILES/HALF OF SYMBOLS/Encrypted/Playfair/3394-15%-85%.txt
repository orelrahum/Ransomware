Howard BESSER, School of Library and Information Science, University of
Pittsburgh, spoke primarily about multimedia, focusing on images and the
broad implications of disseminating them on the network.  He argued that
planning the distribution of multimedia documents posed two critical
implementation problems, which he framed in the form of two questions:
1 What platform will one use and what hardware and software will users
have for viewing of the material?  and 2 How can one deliver a
sufficiently robust set of information in an accessible format in a
reasonable amount of time?  Depending on whether network or CDROM is the
medium used, this question raises different issues of storage,
compression, and transmission.

Concerning the design of platforms e.g., sound, gray scale, simple
color, etc. and the various capabilities users may have, BESSER
maintained that a layered approach was the way to deal with userP
