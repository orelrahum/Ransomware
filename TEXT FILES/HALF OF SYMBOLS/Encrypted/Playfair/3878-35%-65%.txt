His vastness:  Fleeced the flocks and bleating rose,
As plants:  Ambiguous between sea and land
The riverhorse, and scaly crocodile.
At once came forth whatever creeps the ground,
Insect or worm: those waved their limber fans
For wings, and smallest lineaments exact
In all the liveries decked of summers pride
