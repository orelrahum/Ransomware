The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man
Just for unjust that, in such righteousness
To them by faith imputed, they may find
Justification towards God, and peace
Of conscience which the law by ceremonies
Cannot appease nor Man the mortal part
Perform and, not performing, DLAWUF BDGY.
