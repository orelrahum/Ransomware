:Dominica Economy

Overview:
    The economy is dependent on agriculture and thus is highly vulnerable to
    climatic conditions. Agriculture accounts for about 30 of GDP and employs
    40 of the labor force. Principal products include bananas, citrus, mangoes,
    root crops, and coconuts. In 1990, GDP grew by 7, bouncing back from the
    1.6 decline of 1989. The tourist industry remains undeveloped because of a
    rugged coastline and the lack of an international airport.
