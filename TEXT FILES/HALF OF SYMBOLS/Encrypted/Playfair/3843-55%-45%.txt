From those deepthroated engines belched, whose roar
Embowelled with outrageous noise the air,
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul
Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail
Of iron globes which, on the victor host
Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,
That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,
Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell
By thousands, Angel on ArchAngel rolled
The sooner for their arms unarmed, they might
Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift
By quick contraction or remove but now
Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout
Nor served it to relax their serried files.
