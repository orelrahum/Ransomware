Or happiness in this or the other life
All who have their reward on earth, the fruits
Of painful superstition and blind zeal,
Nought seeking but the praise of men, here find
Fit retribution, empty as their deeds
All the unaccomplished works of Natures hand,
Abortive, monstrous, or unkindly mixed,
Dissolved on earth, fleeP MMGRSN, EWR UD LKUD,
