:Cook Islands Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are fruit,
    copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a
    fruitprocessing plant and several clothing factories. Economic development
    is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack
    of natural resources and good transportation links. A large trade deficit is
    annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid.
    Current economic development plans call for exploiting the tourism potential
    and expanding the fishing industry.

Overview:
    In 1991 the economy grew at an estimated 2.5, down somewhat from the 3.6
    gain of 1990 and below the strong 5.5 gain of 1989. Increases in
    agricultural production on the strength of good coffee and banana crops
    and in construction have been offset by lower rates of growth for industry.
    In 1991 consumer prices rose by 27, about the same as in 1990. The trade
    deficit of 270 million was substantially below the 1990 deficit of 677

:Croatia Economy

Overview:
    Before the political disintegration of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia
    stood next to Slovenia as the most prosperous and industrialized area, with
    a per capita output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps
    onethird above the Yugoslav average. Serbia and the Serbdominated army of
    the old Yugoslavia, however, have seized Croatian territory, and the
    overriding determinant of Croatias longterm economic prospects will be the
    final border settlement. Under the most favorable circumstances, Croatia
    will retain the Dalmatian coast with its major tourist attractions and
    Slavonia with its oilfields and rich agricultural land. Even so, Croatia
    would face monumental problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime
    Communist mismanagement of the economy large foreign debt damage during
    the fighting to bridges, factories, powerlines, buildings, and houses and
    the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav
    republics. At the minimum, extensive Western aid and investment, especially
    in the tourist and oil industries, would seem necessary to salvage a
    desperate economic situation. However, peace and political stability must
    come first.

:Cuba Economy

Overview:
    The economy, centrally planned and largely state owned, is highly dependent
    on the agricultural sector and foreign trade. Sugar provided about
    twothirds of export revenues in 1991, and over half was exported to the
    former Soviet republics. The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies
    that have deemphasized material incentives in the workplace, abolished
    farmers informal produce markets, and raised prices of governmentsupplied
    goods and services. In 1990 the economy probably fell 5 largely as a result
    of declining trade with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Recently
    the government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and
    China. Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982. The
    government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist facilities
    and in industrial plants idled by falling imports from the former Soviet
    Union. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic foods, and nickel.
    The annual Soviet subsidy dropped from 4 billion in 1990 to about 1
    billion in 1991 because of a lower price paid for Cuban sugar and a sharp
    decline in Soviet exports to Cuba. The former Soviet republics have
    indicated they will no longer extend aid to Cuba beginning in 1992. Instead
    of highly subsidized trade, Cuba has been shifting to trade at market prices
    in convertible currencies. Because of increasingly severe shortages of
    fuels, industrial raw materials, and spare parts, aggregate output dropped
    by onefifth in 1991.

:Cyprus Economy

Overview:
    The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous. Industry
    contributes 24 to GDP and employs 35 of the labor force, while the service
    sector contributes 44 to GDP and employs 45 of the labor force. Rapid
    growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in tourism
    have played important roles in the average 6.4 rise in GDP between 1985 and
    1990. In mid1991, the World Bank "graduated" Cyprus off its list of
    developing countries. In contrast to the bright picture in the south, the
    Turkish Cypriot economy has less than half the per capita GDP and suffered a
    series of reverses in 1991. Crippled by the effects of the Gulf war, the
    collapse of the fruittoelectronics conglomerate, Polly Peck, Ltd., and a
    drought, the Turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibilliondollar grant
    from Turkey to help ease the burden of the economic crisis. Turkey normally
    underwrites a substantial portion of the TRNC economy.

:Czechoslovakia Economy

Overview:
    Czechoslovakia is highly industrialized by East European standards and has a
    welleducated and skilled labor force. GDP per capita has been the highest
    in Eastern Europe. Annual GDP growth slowed to less than 1 percent during
    the 198590 period. The country is deficient in energy and in many raw
    materials. Moreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European
    standards. In January 1991, Prague launched a sweeping program to convert
    its almost entirely stateowned and controlled economy to a market system.
    The koruna now enjoys almost full internal convertibility and over 90 of
    prices are set by the market. The government is planning to privatize all
    small businesses and roughly twothirds of large enterprises by the end of
    1993. New privatesector activity is also expanding. Agriculture  95
    socialized  is to be privatized by the end of 1992. Reform has taken its
    toll on the economy: inflation was roughly 50 in 1991, unemployment was
    nearly 70, and GDP dropped an estimated 15. In 1992 the government is
    anticipating inflation of 1015, unemployment of 1112, and a drop in GDP
    of up to 8. As of mid1992, the nation appears to be splitting in two 
    into the industrial Czech area and the more agarian Slovak area.

:Denmark Economy

Overview:
    This modern economy features hightech agriculture, uptodate smallscale
    and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable
    living standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark probably
    will continue its successful economic recovery in 1992 with tight fiscal and
    monetary policies and export oriented growth. Prime Minister Schluters
    main priorities are to maintain a current account surplus in order to pay
    off extensive external debt and to continue to freeze publicsector
    expenditures in order to reduce the budget deficit. The rate of growth by
    1993  boosted by increased investment and domestic demand  may be
    sufficient to start to cut Denmarks high unemployment rate, which is
    expected to remain at about 11 in 1992. Low inflation, low wage increases,
    and the current account surplus put Denmark in a good competitive position
    for the ECs anticipated single market, although Denmark must cut its VAT
    and income taxes.

:Djibouti Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on service activities connected with the countrys
    strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa.
    Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
    international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural
    resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent
    on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
    development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30 continues to be a
    major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35 over the last
    five years because of recession and a high population growth rate including
    immigrants and refugees.

:Dominican Republic Economy

Overview:
    The economy is largely dependent on trade imported components average 60
    of the value of goods consumed in the domestic market. Rapid growth of free
    trade zones has established a significant expansion of manufacturing for
    export, especially wearing apparel. Over the past decade, tourism has also
    increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign exchange and a
    source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. The
    principal commercial crop is sugarcane, followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa,
    and tobacco. Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural
    products, durable consumer goods, minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is
    officially reported at about 30, but there is considerable underemployment.
    A fiscal austerity program has brought inflation under control, but in 1991
    the economy contracted for a second straight year.

:Ecuador Economy

Overview:
    Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas. Growth
    has been uneven because of natural disasters for example, a major
    earthquake in 1987, fluctuations in global oil prices, and government
    policies designed to curb inflation. The government has not taken a
    supportive attitude toward either domestic or foreign investment, although
    its agreement to enter the Andean free trade zone is an encouraging move. As
    1991 ended, Ecuador received a standby IMF loan of 105 million, which will
    permit the country to proceed with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt.

:Egypt Economy

Overview:
    Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
    economies, most industrial plants being owned by the government.
    Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment.
    Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but
    in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
    debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
    balanceofpayments support. As part of the 1987 agreement with the IMF, the
    government agreed to institute a reform program to reduce inflation, promote
    economic growth, and improve its external position. The reforms have been
    slow in coming, however, and the economy has been largely stagnant for the
    past four years. The addition of 1 million people every seven months to
    Egypts population exerts enormous pressure on the 5 of the total land area
    available for agriculture.

:El Salvador Economy

Overview:
    The agricultural sector accounts for 25 of GDP, employs about 40 of the
    labor force, and contributes about 66 to total exports. Coffee is the major
    commercial crop, accounting for 45 of export earnings. The manufacturing
    sector, based largely on food and beverage processing, accounts for 18 of
    GDP and 15 of employment. Economic losses because of guerrilla sabotage
    total more than 2 billion since 1979. The costs of maintaining a large
    military seriously constrain the governments efforts to provide essential
    social services. Nevertheless, growth in national output during the period
    199091 exceeded growth in population for the first time since 1987.

:Equatorial Guinea Economy

Overview:
    The economy, destroyed during the regime of former President Macias NGUEMA,
    is now based on agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which account for about
    half of GDP and nearly all exports. Subsistence agriculture predominates,
    with cocoa, coffee, and wood products providing income, foreign exchange,
    and government revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts for
    about 8 of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for
    about 38. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore,
    manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place under
    concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately
    successful.

:Estonia Economy

Overview:
    Starting in July 1991, under a new law on private ownership, small
    enterprises, such as retail shops and restaurants, were sold to private
    owners. The auctioning of largescale enterprises is now in progress with
    the proceeds being held in escrow until the prior ownership that is,
    Estonian or the Commonwealth of Independent States can be established.
    Estonia ranks first in per capita consumption among the former Soviet
    republics. Agriculture is well developed, especially meat production, and
    provides a surplus for export. Only about onefifth of the work force is in
    agriculture. The major share of the work force engages in manufacturing both
    capital and consumer goods based on raw materials and intermediate products
    from the other former Soviet republics. These manufactures are of high
    quality by exSoviet standards and are exported to the other republics.
    Estonias mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil 60
    of old Soviet total and phosphorites 400 million tons. Estonia has a
    large, relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy
    needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants. Like the other 14
    successor republics, Estonia is suffering through a difficult transitional
    period  between a collapsed command economic structure and a
    stilltobebuilt market structure. It has advantages in the transition, not
    having suffered so long under the Soviet yoke and having better chances of
    developing profitable ties to the Nordic and West European countries.

:Ethiopia Economy

Overview:
    Ethiopia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in Africa. Its
    economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which accounts for about 45 of
    GDP, 90 of exports, and 80 of total employment coffee generates 60 of
    export earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
    from the agricultural sector. Over 90 of largescale industry, but less
    than 10 of agriculture, is state run the government is considering selling
    off a portion of stateowned plants. Favorable agricultural weather largely
    explains the 4.5 growth in output in FY89, whereas drought and
    deteriorating internal security conditions prevented growth in FY90. In 1991
    the lack of law and order, particularly in the south, interfered with
    economic development and growth.

:Falkland Islands Islas Malvinas Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on sheep farming, which directly or indirectly employs
    most of the work force. A few dairy herds are kept to meet domestic
    consumption of milk and milk products, and crops grown are primarily those
    for providing winter fodder. Exports feature shipments of highgrade wool to
    the UK and the sale of postage stamps and coins. Rich stocks of fish in the
    surrounding waters are not presently exploited by the islanders. So far,
    efforts to establish a domestic fishing industry have been unsuccessful. In
    1987 the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers
    operating within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees
    amount to more than 40 million per year and are a primary source of income
    for the government. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development
    Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant
    wildlife and trout fishing.

:Faroe Islands Economy

Overview:
    The Faroese, who have long been enjoying the affluent living standards of
    the Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the
    allimportant fishing industry and with an external debt twice the size of
    annual income. When the nations of the world extended their fishing zones to
    200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no longer could continue
    their traditional longdistance fishing and subsequently depleted their own
    nearby fishing areas. The governments tight controls on fish stocks and its
    austerity measures have caused a recession, and subsidy cuts will force
    further reductions in the fishing industry, which has already been plagued
    with bankrupcies. An annual Danish subsidy of 140 million continues to
    provide roughly onethird of the islands budget revenues.

:Fiji Economy

Overview:
    Fijis economy is primarily agricultural, with a large subsistence sector.
    Sugar exports are a major source of foreign exchange, and sugar processing
    accounts for onethird of industrial output. Industry, including sugar
    milling, contributes 13 to GDP. Fiji traditionally had earned considerable
    sums of hard currency from the 250,000 tourists who visited each year. In
    1987, however, after two military coups, the economy went into decline. GDP
    dropped by 7.8 in 1987 and by another 2.5 in 1988 political uncertainty
    created a drop in tourism, and the worst drought of the century caused sugar
    production to fall sharply. In contrast, sugar and tourism turned in strong
    performances in 1989, and the economy rebounded vigorously. In 1990 the
    economy received a setback from cyclone Sina, which cut sugar output by an
    estimated 21.

:Finland Economy

Overview:
    Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market economy, with per
    capita output nearly threefourths the US figure. Its main economic force is
    the manufacturing sector  principally the wood, metals, and engineering
    industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods representing about
    30 of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on
    imported raw materials, energy, and some components of manufactured goods.
    Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining
    selfsufficiency in basic commodities. The economy, which experienced an
    average of 4.9 annual growth between 1987 and 1989, sank into a deep
    recession in 1991 as growth contracted by 6.2. The recession  which is
    expected to bottom out in late 1992  has been caused by economic
    overheating, depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter
    system between Finland and the former Soviet Union in which Soviet oil and
    gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish
    Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and
    efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public
    expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and foreign
    investment and exchange liberalization. Helsinki tied the markkaa to the
    ECs European Currency Unit to promote stability but was forced to devalue
    the markkaa by about 12 in November 1991. The devaluation should improve
    industrial competitiveness and business confidence in 1992. Finland, as a
    member of EFTA, negotiated a European Economic Area arrangement with the EC
    that allows for free movement of capital, goods, services, and labor within
    the organization as of January 1993. Finland applied for full EC membership
    in March 1992.

:France Economy

Overview:
    One of the worlds most developed economies, France has substantial
    agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector.
    Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and
    subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in
    Western Europe. France is largely selfsufficient in agricultural products
    and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector
    generates about onequarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has
    become crucial to the economy. After expanding at a rapid 3.8 pace during
    the period 198889, the economy slowed down in 1990, with growth of 1.5 in
    1990 and 1.4 in 1991 growth in 1992 is expected to be about 2. The
    economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the
    labor force, resulting in a high unemployment rate, which rose to almost 10
    in 1991. The steadily advancing economic integration within the European
    Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic
    sectors.
