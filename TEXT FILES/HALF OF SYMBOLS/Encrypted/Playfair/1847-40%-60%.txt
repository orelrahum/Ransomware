Not here till, by degrees of merit raised,
They open to themselves at length the way
Up hither, under long obedience tried
And Earth be changed to Heaven, and Heaven to Earth,
One kingdom, joy and union without end.
Mean while inhabit lax, ye Powers of Heaven
And thou my Word, begotten Son, by thee
This I perform speak thou, and be it done!
My overshadowing Spirit and Might with thee
I send along ride forth, and bid the Deep
Within appointed bounds be Heaven and Earth
Boundless the Deep, because I Am who fill
Infinitude, nor vacuous the space.
Though I, uncircumscribed myself, retire,
And put not forth my goodness, which is free
To act or not, Necessity and Chance
Approach not me, and what I will is Fate.
So spake the Almighty, and to what he spake
His Word, the Filial Godhead, gave effect.
Immediate are the acts of God, more swift
Than time or motion, but to human ears
Cannot without process of speech be told,
So told as earthly notion can receive.
Great triumph and rejoicing was in Heaven,
When such was heard declared the Almightys will
Glory they sung to the Most High, good will
To future men, and in their dwellings peace
Glory to Him, whose just avenging ire
Had driven out the ungodly from his sight
And the habitations of the just to Him
Glory and praise, whose wisdom had ordained
Good out of evil to create instead
Of Spirits malign, a better race to bring
Into their vacant room, and thence diffuse
His good to worlds and ages infinite.
So sang the Hierarchies:  Mean while the Son
On his great expedition now appeared,
Girt with Omnipotence, with radiance crowned
Of Majesty Divine sapience and love
Immense, and all his Father in him shone.
About his chariot numberless were poured
