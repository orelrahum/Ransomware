thinking over all the children she knew that were of the same age
as herself, to see if she could have been changed for any of
them.

  Im sure Im not Ada, she said, for her hair goes in such
long ringlets, and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and Im
sure I cant be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,
oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHES she, and Im I,
andoh dear, how puzzling it all is!  Ill try if I know all the
things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,
and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven isoh dear!
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the
Multiplication Table doesnt signify:  lets try Geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,
and Romeno, THATS all wrong, Im certain!  I must have been
changed for Mabel!  Ill try and say "How doth the little"
and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,
and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and
strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:

            How doth the little crocodile
              Improve his shining tail,
            And pour the waters of the Nile
              On every golden scale!

            How cheerfully he seems to grin,
              How neatly spread his claws,
            And welcome little fishes in
              With gently smiling jaws!

  Im sure those are not the right words, said poor Alice, and
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, I must be Mabel
after all, and I shall have to go and live in that poky little
house, and have next to no toys to play with, and oh! ever so
many lessons to learn!  No, Ive made up my mind about it if Im
Mabel, Ill stay down here!  Itll be no use their putting their
heads down and saying "Come up again, dear!"  I shall only look
up and say "Who am I then?  Tell me that first, and then, if I
like being that person, Ill come up:  if not, Ill stay down
here till Im somebody else"but, oh dear! cried Alice, with a
sudden burst of tears, I do wish they WOULD put their heads
down!  I am so VERY tired of being all alone here!

  As she said this she looked down at her hands, and was
surprised to see that she had put on one of the Rabbits little
white kid gloves while she was talking.  How CAN I have done
that? she thought.  I must be growing small again.  She got up
and went to the table to measure herself by it, and found that,
as nearly as she could guess, she was now about two feet high,
and was going on shrinking rapidly:  she soon found out that the
cause of this was the fan she was holding, and she dropped it
hastily, just in time to avoid shrinking away altogether.

That WAS a narrow escape! said Alice, a good deal frightened at
the sudden change, but very glad to find herself still in
existence and now for the garden! and she ran with all speed
back to the little door:  but, alas! the little door was shut
again, and the little golden key was lying on the glass table as
before, and things are worse than ever, thought the poor child,
for I never was so small as this before, never!  And I declare
its too bad, that it is!

  As she said these words her foot slipped, and in another
moment, splash! she was up to her chin in salt water.  He first
idea was that she had somehow fallen into the sea, and in that
case I can go back by railway, she said to herself.  Alice had
been to the seaside once in her life, and had come to the general
conclusion, that wherever you go to on the English coast you find
a number of bathing machines in the sea, some children digging in
the sand with wooden spades, then a row of lodging houses, and
behind them a railway station.  However, she soon made out that
she was in the pool of tears which she had wept when she was nine
feet high.

  I wish I hadnt cried so much! said Alice, as she swam about,
trying to find her way out.  I shall be punished for it now, I
suppose, by being drowned in my own tears!  That WILL be a queer
thing, to be sure!  However, everything is queer today.

  Just then she heard something splashing about in the pool a
little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at
first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then
she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

  Would it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this
mouse?  Everything is so outoftheway down here, that I should
think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, theres no harm in
trying.  So she began:  O Mouse, do you know the way out of
this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!
Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:
she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having
seen in her brothers Latin Grammar, A mouseof a mouseto a
mousea mouseO mouse!  The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
eyes, but it said nothing.

  Perhaps it doesnt understand English, thought Alice I
daresay its a French mouse, come over with WilliaC MRS
