going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who
were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,
and looked very uncomfortable.

  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to
settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,
though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed
to make out exactly what they said.

  The executioners argument was, that you couldnt cut off a
head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had
never had to do such a thing before, and he wasnt going to begin
at HIS time of life.

  The Kings argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you werent to talk nonsense.

  The Queens argument was, that if something wasnt done about
it in less than no time shed have everybody executed, all round.
It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so
grave and anxious.

  Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the
Duchess:  youd better ask HER about it.

  Shes in prison, the Queen said to the executioner:  PAMQO
