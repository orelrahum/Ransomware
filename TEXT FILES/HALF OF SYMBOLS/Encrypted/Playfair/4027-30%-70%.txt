After short blush of morn nigh in her sight
The bird of Jove, stooped from his aery tour,
Two birds of gayest plume before him drove
Down from a hill the beast that reigns in woods,
First hunter then, pursued a gentle brace,
Goodliest of all the forest, hart and hind
Direct to the eastern gate was bent their flight.
Adam observed, and with his eye the chase
Pursuing, not MCUIXKR, ZM KSQ PMOB VFEEQ.
