:Denmark Economy

Overview:
    This modern economy features hightech agriculture, uptodate smallscale
    and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures, comfortable
    living standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark probably
    will continue its successful economic recovery in 1992 with tight fiscal and
    monetary policies and export oriented growth. Prime Minister Schluters
    main priorities are to maintain a current account surplus in order to pay
    off extensive external debt and to continue to freeze publicsector
    expenditures in order to reduce the budget deficit. The rate of growth by
    1993  boosted by increased investment and domestic demand  may be
    sufficient to start to cut Denmarks high unemployment rate, which is
    expected to remain at about 11 in 1992. Low inflation, low wage increases,
    and the current account surplus put Denmark in a good competitive position
    for the ECs anticipated single market, although Denmark must cut its VAT
    and income taxes.
