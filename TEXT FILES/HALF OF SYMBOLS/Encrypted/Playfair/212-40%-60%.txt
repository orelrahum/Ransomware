Swallows him with his host but them lets pass,
As on dry land, between two crystal walls
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand
Divided, till his rescued gain their shore:
Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend,
Though present in his Angel who shall go
Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire
By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire
To guide them in their journey, and remove
Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues:
All night he will pursue but his approach
Darkness defends between till morning watch
Then through the fiery pillar, and the cloud,
God looking forth will trouble all his host,
And craze their chariotwheels: when by command
Moses once more his potent rod extends
Over the sea the sea his rod obeys
On their embattled ranks the waves return,
And overwhelm their war:  The race elect
Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance
Through the wild Desart, not the readiest way
Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed,
War terrify them inexpert, and fear
Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather
Inglorious life with servitude for life
To noble and ignoble is more sweet
Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.
This also shall they gain by their delay
In the wide wilderness there they shall found
Their government, and their great senate choose
Through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained:
God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself
In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets sound,
Ordain them laws part, such as appertain
To civil justice part, religious rites
Of sacrifice informing them, by types
And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise
The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve
Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God
To mortal ear is dreadful:  They beseech
That Moses might report to them his will,
And terrour cease he grants what they besought,
Instructed that to God is no access
Without Mediator, whose high office now
Moses in figure bears to introduce
One greater, of whose day he shall foretel,
And all the Prophets in their age the times
Of great Messiah shall sing.  Thus, laws and rites
Established, such delight hath God in Men
Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes
Among them to set up his tabernacle
The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed
Of cedar, overlaid with gold therein
An ark, and in the ark his testimony,
The records of his covenant over these
A mercyseat of gold, between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim before him burn
Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing
The heavenly fires over the tent a cloud
Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night
Save when they journey, and at length they come,
Conducted by his Angel, to the land
Promised to Abraham and his seed:The rest
Were long to tell how many battles fought
How many kings destroyed and kingdoms won
Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still
A day entire, and nights due course adjourn,
Mans voice commanding, Sun, in Gibeon stand,
And thou moon in the vale of Aialon,
Till Israel overcome! so call the third
From Abraham, son of Isaac and from him
His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.
Here Adam interposed.  O sent from Heaven,
Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things
Thou hast revealed those chiefly, which concern
Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find
Mine eyes trueopening, and my heart much eased
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become
Of me and all mankind:  But now I see
His day, in whom all nations shall be blest
Favour unmerited by me, who sought
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.
This yet I apprehend not, why to those
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth
So many and so various laws are given
So many laws argue so many sins
Among them how can God with such reside?
To whom thus Michael.  Doubt not but that sin
Will reign among them, as of thee begot
And therefore was law given them, to evince
Their natural pravity, by stirring up
Sin against law to fight: that when they see
Law can discover sin, but not remove,
Save by those shadowy expiations weak,
The blood of bulls and goats, they may conclude
Some blood more precious must be paid for Man
Just for unjust that, in such righteousness
To them by faith imputed, they may find
Justification towards God, and peace
Of conscience which the law by ceremonies
Cannot appease nor Man the mortal part
Perform and, not performing, cannot live.
So law appears imperfect and but given
With purpose to resign them, in full time,
Up to a better covenant disciplined
From shadowy types to truth from flesh to spirit
From imposition of strict laws to free
Acceptance of large grace from servile fear
To filial works of law to works of faith.
And therefore shall not Moses, though of God
Highly beloved, being but the minister
Of law, his people into Canaan lead
But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call,
His name and office bearing, who shall quell
The adversarySerpent, and bring back
Through the worlds wilderness longwandered Man
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
Mean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed,
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins
National interrupt their publick peace,
Provoking God to raise them enemies
From whom as oft he saves them penitent
By Judges first, then under Kings of whom
The second, both for piety renowned
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive
Irrevocable, that his regal throne
For ever shall endure the like shall sing
All Prophecy, that of the royal stock
Of David so I name this king shall rise
A Son, the Womans seed to thee foretold,
Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust
All nations and to kings foretold, of kings
The last for of his reign shall be no end.
But first, a long succession must ensue
And his next son, for wealth and wisdom famed,
The clouded ark of God, till then in tents
Wandering, shall in a glorious temple enshrine.
Such follow him, as shall be registered
Part good, part bad of bad the longer scroll
Whose foul idolatries, EWR MZRSN PLNBFB
