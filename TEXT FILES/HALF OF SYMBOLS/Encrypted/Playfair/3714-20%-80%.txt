To gorge the flesh of lambs or yeanling kids,
On hills where flocks are fed, flies toward the springs
Of Ganges or Hydaspes, Indian streams
But in his way lights on the barren plains
Of Sericana, where Chineses drive
With sails and wind their cany waggons light:
So, on this windy sea of land, the Fiend
Walked up and down alone, bent on his prey
Alone, for other creature in this place,
Living or lifeless, to be found was none
None yet, but store hereafter from the earth
Up hither like aereal vapours flew
