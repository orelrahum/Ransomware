:Benin Economy

Overview:
    Benin is one of the least developed countries in the world because of
    limited natural resources and a poorly developed infrastructure. Agriculture
    accounts for about 35 of GDP, employs about 60 of the labor force, and
    generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings. The industrial sector
    contributes only about 15 to GDP and employs 2 of the work force. Low
    prices in recent years have kept down hard currency earnings from Benins
    major exports of agricultural products and crude oil.
