Manslaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
Of human glory and for glory done
Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours
Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods
Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.
Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth
And what most merits fame, in silence hid.
But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
The only righteous in a world preverse,
And therefore hated, therefore so beset
With foes, for daring single to be just,
And utter odious truth, that God would come
To judge them with his Saints him the Most High
Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds
Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God
High in salvation and the climes of bliss,
Exempt from death to show thee what reward
Awaits the good the rest what punishment
Which now direct thine eyes and soon behold.
He looked, and saw the face of things quite changed
The brazen throat of war had ceased to roar
All now was turned to jollity and game,
To luxury and riot, feast and dance
Marrying or prostituting, as befel,
Rape or adultery, where passing fair
Allured them thence from cups to civil broils.
At length a reverend sire among them came,
And of their doings great dislike declared,
And testified against their ways he oft
Frequented their assemblies, whereso met,
Triumphs or festivals and to them preached
Conversion and repentance, as to souls
In prison, under judgements imminent:
But all in vain: which when he saw, he ceased
Contending, and removed his tents far off
Then, from the mountain hewing timber tall,
Began to build a vessel of huge bulk
Measured by cubit, length, and breadth, and highth
Smeared round with pitch and in the side a door
Contrived and of provisions laid in large,
For man and beast: when lo, a wonder strange!
Of every beast, and bird, and insect small,
Came sevens, and pairs and entered in as taught
Their order: last the sire and his three sons,
With their four wives and God made fast the door.
Mean while the southwind rose, and, with black wings
Widehovering, all the clouds together drove
From under Heaven the hills to their supply
Vapour, and exhalation dusE YWR UIHVZ,
