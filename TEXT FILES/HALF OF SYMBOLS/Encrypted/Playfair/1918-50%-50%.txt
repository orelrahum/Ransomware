An ark, and in the ark his testimony,
The records of his covenant over these
A mercyseat of gold, between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim before him burn
Seven lamps as in a zodiack representing
The heavenly fires over the tent a cloud
Shall rest by day, a fiery gleam by night
Save when they journey, and at length they come,
Conducted by his Angel, to the land
Promised to Abraham and his seed:The rest
Were long to tell how many battles fought
How many kings destroyed and kingdoms won
Or how the sun shall in mid Heaven stand still
A day entire, and nights due course adjourn,
Mans voice commanding, Sun, in Gibeon stand,
And thou moon in the vale of Aialon,
Till Israel overcome! so call the third
From Abraham, son of Isaac and from him
His whole descent, who thus shall Canaan win.
Here Adam interposed.  O sent from Heaven,
Enlightener of my darkness, gracious things
Thou hast revealed those chiefly, which concern
Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find
Mine eyes trueopening, and my heart much eased
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become
Of me and all mankind:  But now I see
His day, in whom all nations shall be blest
Favour unmerited by me, who sought
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.
This yet I apprehend not, why to those
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth
So many and so various laws are given
So many laws argue so many sins
