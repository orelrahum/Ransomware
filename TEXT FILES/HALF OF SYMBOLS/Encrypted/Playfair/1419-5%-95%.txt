:Cyprus Economy

Overview:
    The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous. Industry
    contributes 24 to GDP and employs 35 of the labor force, while the service
    sector contributes 44 to GDP and employs 45 of the labor force. Rapid
    growth in exports of agricultural and manufactured products and in tourism
    have played important roles in the average 6.4 rise in GDP between 1985 and
    1990. In mid1991, the World Bank "graduated" Cyprus off its list of
    developing countries. In contrast to the bright picture in the south, the
    Turkish Cypriot economy has less than half the per capita GDP and suffered a
    series of reverses in 1991. Crippled by the effects of the Gulf war, the
    collapse of the fruittoelectronics conglomerate, Polly Peck, Ltd., and a
    drought, the Turkish area in late 1991 asked for a multibilliondollar grant
    from Turkey to help ease the burden of the economic crisis. Turkey normally
    underwrites a substantial portion of the TRNC economy.

:Czechoslovakia Economy

Overview:
    Czechoslovakia is highly industrialized by East European standards and has a
    welleducated and skilled labor force. GDP per capita has been the highest
    in Eastern Europe. Annual GDP growth slowed to less than 1 percent during
    the 198590 period. The country is deficient in energy and in many raw
    materials. Moreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European
    standards. In January 1991, Prague launched a sweeping program to convert
    its almost entirely stateowned and controlled economy to a market system.
    The koruna now enjoys almost full internal convertibility and over 90 of
    prices are set by the market. The government is planning to privatize all
    small businesses and roughly twothirds of large enterprises by the end of
    1993. New privatesector activity is also expanding. Agriculture  95
    socialized  is to be privatized by the end of 1992. Reform has taken its
    toll on the economy: inflation was roughly 50 in 1991, unemployment was
    nearly 70, and GDP dropped an estimated 15. In 1992 the government is
    anticipating inflation of 1015, unemployment of 1112, and a drop in GDP
    of up to 8. As of mid1992, the nation appears to be splitting in two 
    into the industrial Czech area and the more agarian Slovak area.
