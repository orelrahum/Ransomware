This universe, and all created things:
One foot he centered, and the other turned
Round through the vast profundity obscure
And said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,
This be thy just circumference, O World!
Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,
Matter unformed and void:  Darkness profound
Covered the abyss: but on the watery calm
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,
And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth
Throughout the fluid mass but downward purged
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs,
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed
Like things to like the rest to several place
Disparted, and between spun out the air
And Earth selfbalanced on her center hung.
Let there be light, said God and forthwith Light
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,
Sprung from the deep and from her native east
To journey through the aery gloom began,
Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun
Was not she in a cloudy tabernacle
Sojourned the while.  God saw the light was good
And light from darkness by the hemisphere
Divided: light the Day, and darkness Night,
He named.  Thus was the first day even and morn:
Nor past uncelebrated, nor unsung
By the celestial quires, when orient light
Exhaling first from darkness they beheld
Birthday of Heaven and Earth with joy and shout
The hollow universal orb they filled,
And touched their golden harps, and hymning praised
God and his works Creator him they sung,
Both when first evening was, and when first morn.
Again, God said,  Let there be firmament
Amid the waters, and let it divide
The waters from the waters and God made
The firmament, expanse of liquid, pure,
Transparent, elemental air, diffused
In circuit to the uttermost convex
Of this great round partition firm and sure,
The waters underneath from those above
Dividing: for as earth, so he the world
Built on circumfluous waters calm, in wide
Crystalline ocean, and the loud misrule
Of Chaos far removed lest fierce extremes
Contiguous might distemper the whole frame:
And Heaven he named the Firmament:  So even
And morning chorus sHDF PMS PQRUWW VYK.
