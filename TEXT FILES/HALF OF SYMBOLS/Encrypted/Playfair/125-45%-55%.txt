	mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
	against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
	treacherous device and never leave thee till he
	hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other
	for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
	it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
	day living. I speak but brotherly of him but
	should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
	blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.

CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
	tomorrow, Ill give him his payment: if ever he go
	alone again, Ill never wrestle for prize more: and
	so God keep your worship!

OLIVER	Farewell, good Charles.

	Exit CHARLES

	Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
	an end of him for my soul, yet I know not why,
	hates nothing more than he. Yet hes gentle, never
	schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
	all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
	in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
	people, who best know him, that I am altogether
	misprised: but it shall not be so long this
	wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
	I kindle the boy thither which now Ill go about.

	Exit




	AS YOU LIKE IT


ACT I



SCENE II	Lawn before the Dukes palace.


	Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

CELIA	I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

ROSALIND	Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of
	and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
	teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
	learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.

CELIA	Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
	that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
	had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
	hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
	love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
	if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
	tempered as mine is to thee.

ROSALIND	Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
	rejoice in yours.

CELIA	You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
	like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
	be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
	father perforce, I will render thee again in
	affection by mine honour, I will and when I break
	that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
	sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.

ROSALIND	From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
	me see what think you of falling in love?

CELIA	Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
	love no man in good earnest nor no further in sport
	neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
	in honour come off again.

ROSALIND	What shall be our sport, then?

CELIA	Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
	her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.

ROSALIND	I would we could do so, for her benefits are
	mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
	doth most mistake in her gifts to women.

CELIA	Tis true for those that she makes fair she scarce
	makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
	makes very illfavouredly.

ROSALIND	Nay, now thou goest from Fortunes office to
	Natures: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
	not in the lineaments of Nature.

	Enter TOUCHSTONE

CELIA	No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
	not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
	hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
	Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?

ROSALIND	Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
	Fortune makes Natures natural the cutteroff of
	Natures wit.

CELIA	Peradventure this is not Fortunes work neither, but
	Natures who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
	to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
	natural for our whetstone for always the dulness of
	the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
	wit! whither wander you?

TOUCHSTONE	Mistress, you must come away to your father.
