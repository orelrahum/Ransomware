                      Who Stole the Tarts?


  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts
of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:
the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on
each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit,
with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the
other.  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large
dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice
quite hungry to look at themI wish theyd get the trial done,
she thought, and hand round the refreshments!  But there seemed
to be no chance of this, so she began looking at everything about
her, to pass away the time.

  Alice had never been in a court of justice before, but she had
read about them in books, and she was quite pleased to find that
she knew the name of nearly everything there.  Thats the
judge, she said to herself, because of his great wig.

  The judge, by the way, was the King and as he wore his crown
over the wig, look at the frontispiece if you want to see how he
did it, he did not look at all comfortable, and it was certainly
not becoming.

  And thats the jurybox, thought Alice, and those twelve
creatures, she was obliged to say creatures, you see, because
some of them were animals, and some were birds, I suppose they
are the jurors.  She said this last word two or three times over
to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and
rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the
meaning of it aF QXV.  MIRYSKD, HHNQOAR YWNFR IKLK RUWK HHLZ
