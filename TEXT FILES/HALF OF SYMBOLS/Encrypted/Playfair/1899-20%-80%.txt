Reluctance against God and his just yoke
Laid on our necks.  Remember with what mild
And gracious temper he both heard, and judged,
Without wrath or reviling we expected
Immediate dissolution, which we thought
Was meant by death that day when lo!to thee
Pains only in childbearing were foretold,
And bringing forth soon recompensed with joy,
Fruit of thy womb:  On me the curse aslope
Glanced on the ground with labour I must earn
My bread what harm? Idleness had been worse
My labour will sustain me and, lest cold
Or heat should injure us, his timely care
Hath, unbesought, provided and his hands
Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear
Be open, and his heart to pity incline,
And teach us further by what means to shun
The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!
Which now the sky, with various face, begins
To show us in this mountain while the winds
Blow moist and keen, shattering the graceful locks
Of these fair spreading trees which bids us seek
Some better shroud, some better warmth to cherish
Our limbs benummed, ere this diurnal star
Leave cold the night, how we his gathered beams
Reflected may with matter sere foment
Or, by collision of two bodies, grind
The air attrite to fire as late the clouds
Justling, or pushed with winds, rude in their shock,
Tine the slant lightning whose thwart flame, driven down
Kindles the gummy bark of fir or pine
And sends a comfortable heat from far,
Which might supply the sun:  Such fire to use,
And what may else be remedy or cure
To evils which our own misdeeds have wrought,
He will instruct us praying, and of grace
Beseeching him so as we need not fear
To pass commodiously this life, sustained
By him with many comforts, till we end
In dust, our final rest and native home.
What better can we do, than, to the place
Repairing where he judged us, prostrate fall
Before him reverent and there confess
Humbly our faultL, EWR FECRUW SQZ DMGM PQYEP
