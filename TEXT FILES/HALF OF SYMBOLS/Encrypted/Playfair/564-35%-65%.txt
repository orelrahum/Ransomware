clinical trials:  It is 1 a highly statistical discipline that 2 does
not require halftones but can satisfy the needs of its audience with line
illustrations and graphic material, and 3 there is a need for the speedy
dissemination of highquality research results.  Clinical trials are
research activities that involve the administration of a test treatment
to some experimental unit in order to test its usefulness before it is
made available to the general population.  LEBRON proceeded to give
additional information on OJCCT concerning its editorinchief, editorial
board, editorial content, and the types of articles it publishes
including peerreviewed research reports and reviews, as well as
features shared by other traditional hardcopy journals.

Among the advantages of the electronic format are faster dissemination of
information, including raw data, and the absence of space constraints
because pages do not exist.  This latter fact creates an interesting
situation when it comes to citations.  Nor are there any issues.  AAASs
capacity to download materials directly from the journal to a
subscribers printer, hard drive, or floppy disk helps ensure highly
accurate transcription.  Other features of OJCCT include onscreen alerts
that allow linkage of subsequently published documents to the original
documents online searching by subject, author, title, etc. indexing of
every single word that appears in an article viewing access to an
article by component abstract, full text, or graphs numbered
