:Micronesia, Federated States of Economy

Overview:
    Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing. The
    islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for highgrade
    phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness
    of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development.
    Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the
    US pledged to spend 1 billion in the islands in the l990s. Geographical
    isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to
    longterm growth.

:Moldova Economy

Overview:
    Moldova, the nexttosmallest of the former Soviet republics in area, is the
    most densely inhabited. Moldova has a little more than 1 of the population,
    labor force, capital stock, and output of the former Soviet Union. Living
    standards have been below average for the European USSR. The country enjoys
    a favorable climate, and economic development has been primarily based on
    agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Industry
    accounts for 20 of the labor force, whereas agriculture employs more than
    onethird. Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on the
    former Soviet republics for coal, oil, gas, steel, most electronic
    equipment, machine tools, and major consumer durables such as automobiles.
    Its industrial and agricultural products, in turn, have been exported to the
    other former Soviet republics. Moldova has freed prices on most goods and
    has legalized private ownership of property, including agricultural land.
    Moldovas economic prospects are dimmed by the difficulties of moving toward
    a market economy and the political problems of redefining ties to the other
    former Soviet republics and Romania.
