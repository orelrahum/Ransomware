	SONG.
	Who doth ambition shun

	All together here

	And loves to live i the sun,
	Seeking the food he eats
	And pleased with what he gets,
	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES	Ill give you a verse to this note that I made
	yesterday in despite of my invention.

AMIENS	And Ill sing it.

JAQUES	Thus it goes:

	If it do come to pass
	That any man turn ass,
	Leaving his wealth and ease,
	A stubborn will to please,
	Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
	Here shall he see
	Gross fools as he,
	An if he will come to me.

AMIENS	Whats that ducdame?

JAQUES	Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
	circle. Ill go sleep, if I can if I cannot, Ill
	rail against all the firstborn of Egypt.

AMIENS	And Ill go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.

	Exeunt severally
