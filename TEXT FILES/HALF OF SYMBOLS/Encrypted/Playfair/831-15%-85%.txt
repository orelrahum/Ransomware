:China Economy

Overview:
    Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to move the
    economy from the sluggish Sovietstyle centrally planned economy to a more
    productive and flexible economy with market elements, but still within the
    framework of monolithic Communist control. To this end the authorities have
    switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of
    the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and
    plant managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of smallscale
    enterprise in services and light manufacturing, and opened the foreign
    economic sector to increased trade and joint ventures. The most gratifying
    result has been a strong spurt in production, particularly in agriculture in
    the early 1980s. Industry also has posted major gains, especially in coastal
    areas near Hong Kong and opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and
    modern production methods have helped spur production of both domestic and
    export goods. Aggregate output has more than doubled since 1978. On the
    darker side, the leadership has often experienced in its hybrid system the
    worst results of socialism bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption and of
    capitalism windfall gains and steppedup inflation. Beijing thus has
    periodically backtracked, retightening central controls at intervals and
    thereby lessening the credibility of the reform process. In 1991 output rose
    substantially, particularly in the favored coastal areas. Popular
    resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cKNESB
