JAQUES	A fool, a fool! I met a fool i the forest,
	A motley fool a miserable world!
	As I do live by food, I met a fool
	Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun,
	And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms,
	In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
	Good morrow, fool, quoth I. No, sir, quoth he,
	Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:
	And then he drew a dial from his poke,
	And, looking on it with lacklustre eye,
	Says very wisely, It is ten oclock:
	Thus we may see, quoth he, how the world wags:
	Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
	And after one hour more twill be eleven
	And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
	And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot
	And thereby hangs a tale. When I did hear
	The motley fool thus moral on the time,
	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
	That fools should be so deepcontemplative,
	And I did laugh sans intermission
	An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
	A worthy fool! Motleys the only wear.

DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?

JAQUES	O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
	And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
	They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
	After a voyage, he hath strange places crammd
	With observation, the which he vents
	In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
	I am ambitious for a motley coat.

DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one.

JAQUES	It is my only suit
	Provided that you weed your better judgments
	Of all opinion that grows rank in them
	That I am wise. I must have liberty
	Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
	To blow on whom I please for so fools have
	And they that are mosP FKXVKR DOPM OQ ZUXVX,
