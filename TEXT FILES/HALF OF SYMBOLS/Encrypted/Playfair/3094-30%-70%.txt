  It proves nothing of the sort! said Alice.  Why, you dont
even know what theyre about!

  Read them, said the King.

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty? he asked.

  Begin at the beginning, the King said gravely, and go on
till you come to the end:  then stop.

  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:

        They told me you had been to her,
          And mentioned me to him:
        She gave me a good character,
          But said I could not swim.

        He sent them word I had not gone
          We know it to be true:
        If she should push the matter on,
          What would become of yoO?
