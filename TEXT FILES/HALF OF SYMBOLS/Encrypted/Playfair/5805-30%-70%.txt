:New Caledonia Economy

Overview:
    New Caledonia has more than 25 of the worlds known nickel resources. In
    recent years the economy has suffered because of depressed international
    demand for nickel, the principal source of export earnings. Only a
    negligible amount of the land is suitable for cultivation, and food accounts
    for about 25 of imports.
