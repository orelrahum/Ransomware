pepperbox in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before
she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began
sneezing all at once.

  Give your evidence, said the King.

  Shant, said the cook.

  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a
low voice, Your Majesty must crossexamine THIS witness.

  Well, if I must, I must, the King said, with a melancholy
air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till
his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, What
are tarts made of?

  Pepper, mostly, said the cook.

  Treacle, said a sleepy voice behind her.

  Collar that Dormouse, the Queen shrieked out.  Behead that
Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch
him!  Off with his whiskers!

  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the
Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down
again, the cook had disappeared.

  Never mind! said the King, with an air of great relief.
Call the next witness.  And he added in an undertone to the
Queen, Really, my dear, YOU must crossexamine the next witness.
It quite makes my forehead ache!

  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,
for they havent got much evidence YET, she said to herself.
Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top
of his shrill little voice, the name Alice!



                           CHAPTER XII

                        Alices Evidence


  Here! cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with
the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
the week before.

  Oh, I BEG your pardon! she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
and put back into the jurybox, or they would die.

  The trial cannot proceed, said the King in a very grave
voice, until all the jurymen are back in their proper places
ALL, he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as
he said do.

  Alice looked at the jurybox, and saw that, in her haste, she
had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable
to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right not that
it signifies much, she said to herself I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.

  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them, they set to work very diligently to write
out a history of the accident, all except the Lizard, who seemed
too much overcome to do anything but sit with its mouth open,
gazing up into the roof of the court.

  What do you know about this business? the King said to
Alice.

  Nothing, said Alice.

  Nothing WHATEVER? persisted the King.

  Nothing whatever, said Alice.

  Thats very important, the King said, turning to the jury.
They were just beginning to write this down on their slates, when
the White Rabbit interrupted:  UNimportant, your Majesty means,
of course, he said in a very respectful tone, but frowning and
making faces at him as he spoke.

  UNimportant, of course, I meant, the King hastily said, and
went on to himself in an undertone, importantunimportant
unimportantimportant as if he were trying which word
sounded best.

  Some of the jury wrote it down important, and some
unimportant.  Alice could see this, as she was near enough to
look over their slates but it doesnt matter a bit, she
thought to herself.

  At this moment the King, who had been for some time busily
writing in his notebook, cackled out Silence! and read out
from his book, Rule Fortytwo.  ALL PERSONS MORE THAN A MILE
HIGH TO LEAVE THE COURT.

  Everybody looked at Alice.

  IM not a mile high, said Alice.

  You are, said the King.

  Nearly two miles high, added the Queen.

  Well, I shant go, at any rate, said Alice:  besides,
thats not a regular rule:  you invented it just now.

  Its the oldest rule in the book, said the King.

  Then it ought to be Number One, said Alice.

  The King turned pale, and shut his notebook hastily.
Consider your verdict, he said to the jury, in a low, trembling
voice.

  Theres more evidence to come yet, please your Majesty, said
the White Rabbit, jumping up in a great hurry this paper has
just been picked up.

  Whats in it? said the Queen.

  I havent opened it yet, said the White Rabbit, but it seems
to be a letter, written by the prisoner toto somebody.

  It must have been that, said the King, unless it was
written to nobody, which isnt usual, you know.

  Who is it directed to? said one of the jurymen.

  It isnt directed at all, said the White Rabbit in fact,
theres nothing written on the OUTSIDE.  He unfolded the paper
as he spoke, and added It isnt a letter, after all:  its a set
of verses.

  Are they in the prisoners handwriting? asked another of
they jurymen.

  No, theyre not, said the White Rabbit, and thats the
queerest thing about it.  The jury all looked puzzled.

  He must have imitated somebody elses hand, said the King.
The jury all brightened up again.

  Please your Majesty, said the Knave, I didnt write it, and
they cant prove I did:  theres no name signed at the end.

  If you didnt sign it, said the King, that only makes the
matter worse.  You MUST have meant some mischief, or else youd
have signed your name like an honest man.

  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the
first really clever thing the King had said that day.

  That PROVES his guilt, said the Queen.

  It proves nothing of the sort! said Alice.  Why, you dont
even know what theyre about!

  Read them, said the King.

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty? he asked.

  Begin at the beginning, the King said gravely, and go on
till you come to the end:  then stop.

  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:

        They told me you had been to her,
          And mentioned me to him:
        She gave me a good character,
          But said I could not swim.

        He sent them word I had not gone
          We know it to be true:
        If she should push the matter on,
          What would become of you?

        I gave her one, they gave him two,
          You gave us three or more
        They all returned from him to you,
          Though they were mine before.

        If I or she should chance to be
          Involved in this affair,
        He trusts to you to set them free,
          Exactly as we were.

        My notion was that you had been
          Before she had this fit
        An obstacle that came between
          Him, and ourselves, and it.

        Dont let him know she liked them best,
          For this must ever be
        A secret, kept from all the rest,
          Between yourself and me.

  Thats the most important piece of evidence weve heard yet,
said the King, rubbing his hands so now let the jury

  If any one of them can explain it, said Alice, she had
grown so large in the last few minutes that she wasnt a bit
afraid of interrupting him, Ill give him sixpence.  I dont
believe theres an atom of meaning in it.

  The jury all wrote down on their slates, SHE doesnt believe
theres an atom of meaning in it, but none of them attempted to
explain the paper.

  If theres no meaning in it, said the King, that saves a
world of trouble, you know, as we neednt try to find any.  And
yet I dont know, he went on, spreading out the verses on his
knee, and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some
meaning in them, after all.  "SAID I COULD NOT SWIM" you
cant swim, can you? he added, turning to the Knave.

  The Knave shook his head sadly.  Do I look like it? he said.
Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.

  All right, so far, said the King, and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself:  "WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE" thats
the jury, of course "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO" why,
that must be what he did with the tarts, you know

  But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU," said
Alice.

  Why, there they are! said the King triumphantly, pointing to
the tarts on the table.  Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
Then again"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT"  you never had fits, my
dear, I think? he said to the Queen.

  Never! said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the
Lizard as she spoke.  The unfortunate little Bill had left off
writing on his slate with one finger, as he found it made no
mark but he now hastily began again, using the ink, that was
trickling down his face, as long as it lasted.

  Then the words dont FIT you, said the King, looking round
the court with a smile.  There was a dead silence.

  Its a pun! the King added in an offended tone, and
everybody laughed, Let the jury consider their verdict, the
King said, for about the twentieth time that day.

  No, no! said the Queen.  Sentence firstverdict afterwards.

  Stuff and nonsense! said Alice loudly.  The idea of having
the sentence first!

  Hold your tongue! said the Queen, turning purple.

  I wont! said Alice.

  Off with her head! the Queen shouted at the top of her voice.
Nobody moved.

  Who cares for you? said Alice, she had grown to her full
size by this time.  Youre nothing but a pack of cards!

  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying
down upon her:  she gave a little scream, half of fright and half
of anger, and tried to beat them off, and found herself lying on
the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face.

  Wake up, Alice dear! said her sister Why, what a long
sleep youve had!

  Oh, Ive had such a curious dream! said Alice, and she told
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and
when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, It WAS a
curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea its
getting late.  So Alice got up and ran off, thinking while she
ran, as well she might, what a wonderful dream it had been.

  But her sister sat still just as she left her, leaning her
head on her hand, watching the setting sun, and thinking of
little Alice and all her wonderful Adventures, till she too began
dreaming after a fashion, and this was her dream:

  First, she dreamed of little Alice herself, and once again the
tiny hands were clasped upon her knee, and the bright eager eyes
were looking up into hersshe could hear the very tones of her
voice, and see that queer little toss of her head to keep back
the wandering hair that WOULD always get into her eyesand
still as she listened, or seemed to listen, the whole place
around her became alive the strange creatures of her little
sisters dream.

  The long grass rustled at her feet as the White Rabbit hurried
bythe frightened Mouse splashed his way through the
neighbouring poolshe could hear the rattle of the teacups as
the March Hare and his friends shared their neverending meal,
and the shrill voice of the Queen ordering off her unfortunate
guests to executiononce more the pigbaby was sneezing on the
Duchesss knee, while plates and dishes crashed around itonce
more the shriek of the Gryphon, the squeaking of the Lizards
slatepencil, and the choking of the suppressed guineapigs,
filled the air, mixed up with the distant sobs of the miserable
Mock Turtle.

  So she sat on, with closed eyes, and half believed herself in
Wonderland, though she knew she had but to open them again, and
all would change to dull realitythe grass would be only
rustling in the wind, and the pool rippling to the waving of the
reedsthe rattling teacups would change to tinkling sheep
bells, and the Queens shrill cries to the voice of the shepherd
boyand the sneeze of the baby, the shriek of the Gryphon, and
all thy other queer noises, would change she knew to the
confused clamour of the busy farmyardwhile the lowing of the
cattle in the distance would take the place of the Mock Turtles
heavy sobs.

  Lastly, she pictured to herself how this same little sister of
hers would, in the aftertime, be herself a grown woman and how
she would keep, through all her riper years, the simple and
loving heart of her childhood:  and how she would gather about
her other little children, and make THEIR eyes bright and eager
with many a strange tale, perhaps even with the dream of
Wonderland of long ago:  and how she would feel with all their
simple sorrows, and find a pleasure in all their simple joys,
remembering her own childlife, and the happy summer days.

SCENE I	Orchard of Olivers house.


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

ORLANDO	As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
	bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
	and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
	blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
	sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
	report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
	he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
	properly, stays me here at home unkept for call you
	that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
	differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
	are bred better for, besides that they are fair
	with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
	and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
	brother, gain nothing under him but growth for the
	which his animals on his dunghills are as much
	bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
	plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
	me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
	me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
	brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
	gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
	grieves me and the spirit of my father, which I
	think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
	servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
	know no wise remedy how to avoid it.

ADAM	Yonder comes my master, your brother.

ORLANDO	Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
	shake me up.

	Enter OLIVER

OLIVER	Now, sir! what make you here?

ORLANDO	Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.

OLIVER	What mar you then, sir?

ORLANDO	Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
	made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.

OLIVER	Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.

ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
	What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
	come to such penury?

OLIVER	Know you where your are, sir?

ORLANDO	O, sir, very well here in your orchard.

OLIVER	Know you before whom, sir?

ORLANDO	Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
	you are my eldest brother and, in the gentle
	condition of blood, you should so know me. The
	courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
	you are the firstborn but the same tradition
	takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
	betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
	you albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
	nearer to his reverence.

OLIVER	What, boy!

ORLANDO	Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.

OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?

ORLANDO	I am no villain I am the youngest son of Sir
	Rowland de Boys he was my father, and he is thrice
	a villain that says such a father begot villains.
	Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
	from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
	tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.

ADAM	Sweet masters, be patient: for your fathers
	remembrance, be at accord.

OLIVER	Let me go, I say.

ORLANDO	I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
	father charged you in his will to give me good
	education: you have trained me like a peasant,
	obscuring and hiding from me all gentlemanlike
	qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
	me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
	me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
	give me the poor allottery my father left me by
	testament with that I will go buy my fortunes.

OLIVER	And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
	Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
	with you you shall have some part of your will: I
	pray you, leave me.

ORLANDO	I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.

OLIVER	Get you with him, you old dog.

ADAM	Is old dog my reward? Most true, I have lost my
	teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
	he would not have spoke such a word.

	Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM

OLIVER	Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
	physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
	crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!

	Enter DENNIS

DENNIS	Calls your worship?

OLIVER	Was not Charles, the dukes wrestler, here to speak with me?

DENNIS	So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
	access to you.

OLIVER	Call him in.

	Exit DENNIS

	Twill be a good way and tomorrow the wrestling is.

	Enter CHARLES

CHARLES	Good morrow to your worship.

OLIVER	Good Monsieur Charles, whats the new news at the
	new court?

CHARLES	Theres no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
	that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
	brother the new duke and three or four loving lords
	have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
	whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke
	therefore he gives them good leave to wander.

OLIVER	Can you tell if Rosalind, the dukes daughter, be
	banished with her father?

CHARLES	O, no for the dukes daughter, her cousin, so loves
	her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
	that she would have followed her exile, or have died
	to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
	less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter and
	never two ladies loved as they do.

OLIVER	Where will the old duke live?

CHARLES	They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
	a many merry men with him and there they live like
	the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
	gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
	carelessly, as they did in the golden world.

OLIVER	What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?

CHARLES	Marry, do I, sir and I came to acquaint you with a
	matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
	to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
	Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit and he that
	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
	well. Your brother is but young and tender and,
	for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
	must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
	out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
	withal, that either you might stay him from his
	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
	run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
	and altogether against my will.

OLIVER	Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
	thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
	myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and
	have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
	it, but he is resolute. Ill tell thee, Charles:
	it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
	of ambition, an envious emulator of every mans
	good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
	me his natural brother: therefore use thy
	discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck
	as his finger. And thou wert best look tot for if
	thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
	mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
	against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
	treacherous device and never leave thee till he
	hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other
	for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
	it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
	day living. I speak but brotherly of him but
	should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
	blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.

CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
	tomorrow, Ill give him his payment: if ever he go
	alone again, Ill never wrestle for prize more: and
	so God keep your worship!

OLIVER	Farewell, good Charles.

	Exit CHARLES

	Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
	an end of him for my soul, yet I know not why,
	hates nothing more than he. Yet hes gentle, never
	schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
	all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
	in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
	people, who best know him, that I am altogether
	misprised: but it shall not be so long this
	wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
	I kindle the boy thither which now Ill go about.

	Exit

	Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

CELIA	I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

ROSALIND	Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of
	and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
	teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
	learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.

CELIA	Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
	that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
	had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
	hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
	love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
	if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
	tempered as mine is to thee.

ROSALIND	Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
	rejoice in yours.

CELIA	You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
	like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
	be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
	father perforce, I will render thee again in
