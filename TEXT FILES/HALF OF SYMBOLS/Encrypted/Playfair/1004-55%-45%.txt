Note:
    Between early 1975 and late 1976 Lebanon was torn by civil war between its
    Christians  then aided by Syrian troops  and its Muslims and their
    Palestinian allies. The ceasefire established in October 1976 between the
    domestic political groups generally held for about six years, despite
    occasional fighting. Syrian troops constituted as the Arab Deterrent Force
    by the Arab League have remained in Lebanon. Syrias move toward supporting
    the Lebanese Muslims, and the Palestinians and Israels growing support for
    Lebanese Christians, brought the two sides into rough equilibrium, but no
    progress was made toward national reconciliation or political reforms  the
    original cause of the war. Continuing Israeli concern about the Palestinian
    presence in Lebanon led to the Israeli invasion of Lebanon in June 1982.
    Israeli forces occupied all of the southern portion of the country and
    mounted a summerlong siege of Beirut, which resulted in the evacuation of
    the PLO from Beirut in September under the supervision of a multinational
    force MNF made up of US, French, and Italian troops. Within days of the
    departure of the MNF, Lebanons newly elected president, Bashir Gemayel, was
    assassinated his elder brother Amin was elected to succeed him. In the
    immediate wake of Bashirs death, however, Christian militiamen massacred
    hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two Beirut camps. This prompted the
    return of the MNF to ease the security burden on Lebanons weak Army and
    security forces. In late March 1984 the last MNF units withdrew. In 1988,
    President Gemayel completed his term of office. Because parliamentarians
    failed to elect a presidential successor, Gemayel appointed then Lebanese
    Armed Forces LAF Commander Gen. Michel Awn acting president. Lebanese
    parliamentarians met in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in late 1989 and concluded a
    national reconciliation pact that codified a new powersharing formula,
    specifying reduced powers for the ChristiaA HESPDKARF QWR IDGDDF UOBXHUB
