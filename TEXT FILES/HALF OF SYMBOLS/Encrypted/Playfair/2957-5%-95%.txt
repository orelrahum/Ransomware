long ringlets, and mine doesnt go in ringlets at all and Im
sure I cant be Mabel, for I know all sorts of things, and she,
oh! she knows such a very little!  Besides, SHES she, and Im I,
andoh dear, how puzzling it all is!  Ill try if I know all the
things I used to know.  Let me see:  four times five is twelve,
and four times six is thirteen, and four times seven isoh dear!
I shall never get to twenty at that rate!  However, the
Multiplication Table doesnt signify:  lets try Geography.
London is the capital of Paris, and Paris is the capital of Rome,
and Romeno, THATS all wrong, Im certain!  I must have been
changed for Mabel!  Ill try and say "How doth the little"
and she crossed her hands on her lap as if she were saying lessons,
and began to repeat it, but her voice sounded hoarse and
strange, and the words did not come the same as they used to do:

            How doth the little crocodile
              Improve his shining tail,
            And pour the waters of the Nile
              On every golden scale!

            How cheerfully he seems to grin,
              How neatly spread his claws,
            And welcome little fishes in
              With gently smiling jaws!

  Im sure those are not the right words, said poor Alice, and
her eyes filled with tears again as she went on, I must be Mabel
after all, and I shall have to go and live in that pHEK VUZBSA
