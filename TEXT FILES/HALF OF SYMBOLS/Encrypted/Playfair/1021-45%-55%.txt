:Madagascar Economy

Overview:
    Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. Agriculture,
    including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting
    for over 40 of GDP, employing about 80 of the labor force, and
    contributing to more than 70 of total export earnings. Industry is largely
    confined to the processing of agricultural products and textile
    manufacturing in 1990 it accounted for only 16 of GDP and employed almost
    5 of the labor force. In 1986 the government introduced a fiveyear
    development plan that stressed selfsufficiency in food mainly rice by
    1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After
    mid1991, however, output dropped sharply because of protracted
    antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political reform.
