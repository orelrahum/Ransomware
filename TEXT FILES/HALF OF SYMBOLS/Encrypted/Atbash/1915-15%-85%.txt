To sow a jangling noise of words unknown:
Forthwith a hideous gabble rises loud,
Among the builders each to other calls
Not understood till hoarse, and all in rage,
As mocked they storm: great laughter was in Heaven,
And looking down, to see the hubbub strange,
And hear the din:  Thus was the building left
Ridiculous, and the work Confusion named.
Whereto thus Adam, fatherly displeased.
O execrable son! so to aspire
Above his brethren to himself assuming
Authority usurped, from God not given:
He gave us only over beast, fish, fowl,
Dominion absolute that right we hold
By his donation but man over men
He made not lord such title to himself
Reserving, human left from human free.
But this usurper his encroachment proud
Stays not on Man to God his tower intends
Siege and defiance:  Wretched man!what food
Will he convey up thither, to sustain
Himself and his rash army where thin air
Above the clouds will pine his entrails gross,
And famish him of breath, if not of bread?
To whom thus Michael.  Justly thou abhorrest
That son, who on the quiet state of men
Such trouble brought, affecting to subdue
Rational liberty yet know withal,
Since thy original lapse, true liberty
Is lost, which always with right reason dwells
Twinned, and from her hath no dividual being:
Reason in man obscured, or not obeyed,
Immediately inordinate desires,
And upstart passions, catch the government
From reason and to servitude reduce
Man, till then free.  Therefore, since he permits
Within himself unworthy powers to reign
Over free reason, God, in judgement just,
Subjects him from without to violent lords
Who oft as undeservedly enthrall
His outward freedom:  Tyranny must be
Though to the tyrant thereby no excuse.
Yet sometimes nations will decline so low
From virtue, which is reason, that no wrong,
But justice, and some fatal curse annexed,
Deprives them of their outward liberty
Their inward lost:  Witness the irreverent son
Of him who built the ark who, for the shame
Done to his father, heard this heavy curse,
Servant of servants, on his vicious race.
Thus will this latter, as the former world,
Still tend from bad to worse till God at last,
Wearied with their iniquities, withdraw
His presence from among them, and avert
His holy eyes resolvRMT UILN GSVMXVULIGS
