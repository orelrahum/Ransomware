  She had quite forgotten the Duchess by this time, and was a
little startled when she heard her voice close to her ear.
Youre thinking about something, my dear, and that makes you
forget to talk.  I cant tell you just now what the moral of that
is, but I shall remember it in a bit.

  Perhaps it hasnt one, Alice ventured to remark.

  Tut, tut, child! said the Duchess.  Everythings got a
moral, if only you can find it.  And she squeezed herself up
closer to Alices side as she spoke.

  Alice did not much like keeping so close to her:  first,
because the Duchess was VERY ugly and secondly, because she was
exactly the right height to rest her chin upon Alices shoulder,
and it was an uncomfortably sharp chin.  However, she did not
like to be rude, so she bore it as well as she could.

  The games going on rather better now, she said, by way of
keeping up the conversation a little.
