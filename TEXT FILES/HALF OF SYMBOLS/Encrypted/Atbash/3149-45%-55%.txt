	Which I did store to be my fosternurse
	When service should in my old limbs lie lame
	And unregarded age in corners thrown:
	Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
	Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
	Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold
	And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
	Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty
	For in my youth I never did apply
	Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
	Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
	The means of weakness and debility
	Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
	Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you
	Ill do the service of a younger man
	In all your business and necessities.
