	Unto the sweet birds throat,
	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES	More, more, I prithee, more.

AMIENS	It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.

JAQUES	I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
	melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
	More, I prithee, more.

AMIENS	My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.

JAQUES	I do not desire you to please me I do desire you to
	sing. Come, more another stanzo: call you em stanzos?

AMIENS	What you will, Monsieur Jaques.

JAQUES	Nay, I care not for their names they owe me
	nothing. Will you sing?

AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself.

JAQUES	Well then, if ever I thank any man, Ill thank you
	but that they call compliment is like the encounter
	of two dogapes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
	the beggarly thanks. Come, sing and you that will
	not, hold your tongues.

AMIENS	Well, Ill end the song. Sirs, cover the while the
	duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
	this day to look you.

JAQUES	And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
	too disputable for my company: I think of as many
	matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
	boast of them. Come, warble, come.

	SONG.
	Who doth ambition shun

	All together here

	And loves to live i the sun,
	Seeking the food he eats
	And pleased with what he gets,
	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES	Ill give you a verse to this note that I made
	yesterday in despite of my invention.

AMIENS	And Ill sing it.

JAQUES	Thus it goes:

	If it do come to pass
	That any man turn ass,
	Leaving his wealth and ease,
	A stubborn will to please,
	Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
	Here shall he see
	Gross fools as he,
	An if he will come to me.

AMIENS	Whats that ducdame?

JAQUES	Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
	circle. Ill go sleep, if I can if I cannot, Ill
	rail against all the firstborn of Egypt.

AMIENS	And Ill go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.

	Exeunt severally

SCENE VI	The forest.


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

ADAM	Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!
	Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
	kind master.

ORLANDO	Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live
	a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little.
	If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I
	will either be food for it or bring it for food to
	thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
	For my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at
	the arms end: I will here be with thee presently
	and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
	give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
	come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
	thou lookest cheerly, and Ill be with thee quickly.
	Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
	thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for
	lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this
	desert. Cheerly, good Adam!

ACT II



SCENE VII	The forest.


	A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and
	Lords like outlaws

DUKE SENIOR	I think he be transformd into a beast
	For I can no where find him like a man.

First Lord	My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
	Here was he merry, hearing of a song.

DUKE SENIOR	If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
	Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.

	Enter JAQUES

First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach.

DUKE SENIOR	Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
	That your poor friends must woo your company?
	What, you look merrily!

JAQUES	A fool, a fool! I met a fool i the forest,
	A motley fool a miserable world!
	As I do live by food, I met a fool
	Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun,
	And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms,
	In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
	Good morrow, fool, quoth I. No, sir, quoth he,
	Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:
	And then he drew a dial from his poke,
	And, looking on it with lacklustre eye,
	Says very wisely, It is ten oclock:
	Thus we may see, quoth he, how the world wags:
	Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
	And after one hour more twill be eleven
	And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
	And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot
	And thereby hangs a tale. When I did hear
	The motley fool thus moral on the time,
	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
	That fools should be so deepcontemplative,
	And I did laugh sans intermission
	An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
	A worthy fool! Motleys the only wear.

DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?

JAQUES	O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
	And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
	They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
	After a voyage, he hath strange places crammd
	With observation, the which he vents
	In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
	I am ambitious for a motley coat.

DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one.

JAQUES	It is my only suit
	Provided that you weed your better judgments
	Of all opinion that grows rank in them
	That I am wise. I must have liberty
	Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
	To blow on whom I please for so fools have
	And they that are most galled with my folly,
	They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
