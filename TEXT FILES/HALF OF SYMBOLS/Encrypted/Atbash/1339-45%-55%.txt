  What I was going to say, said the Dodo in an offended tone,
was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucusrace.

  What IS a Caucusrace? said Alice not that she wanted much
to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

  Why, said the Dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it.
And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter
day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.

  First it marked out a racecourse, in a sort of circle, the
exact shape doesnt matter, it said, and then all the party
were placed along the course, here and there.  There was no One,
two, three, and away, but they began running when they liked,
and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know
when the race was over.  However, when they had been running half
an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called
out The race is over! and they all crowded round it, panting,
and asking, But who has won?

  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,
in the pictures of him, while the rest waited in silence.  At
last the Dodo said, EVERYBODY has won, and all must have
prizes.

  But who is to give the prizes? quite a chorus of voices
asked.

  Why, SHE, of course, said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with
one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her,
calling out in a confused way, Prizes! Prizes!

  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand
in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, luckily the salt
water had not got into it, and handed them round as prizes.
There was exactly one apiece all round.

  But she must have a prize herself, you know, said the Mouse.

  Of course, the Dodo replied very gravely.  What else have
you got in your pocket? he went on, turning to Alice.

  Only a thimble, said Alice sadly.

  Hand it over here, said the Dodo.

  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo
solemnly presented the thimble, saying We beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble and, when it had finished this short
speech, they all cheered.

  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked
so grave that she did not dare to laugh and, as she could not
think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,
looking as solemn as she could.

  The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise
and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not
taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
the back.  However, it was over at last, and they sat down again
in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

  You promised to tell me your history, you know, said Alice,
and why it is you hateC and D, she added in a whisper, half
afraid that it would be offended again.

  Mine is a long and a sad tale! said the Mouse, turning to
Alice, and sighing.

  It IS a long tail, certainly, said Alice, looking down with
wonder at the Mouses tail but why do you call it sad?  And
she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so
that her idea of the tale was something like this:

                    Fury said to a
                   mouse, That he
                 met in the
               house,
            "Let us
              both go to
                law:  I will
                  prosecute
                    YOU.  Come,
                       Ill take no
                        denial We
                     must have a
                 trial:  For
              really this
           morning Ive
          nothing
         to do."
           Said the
             mouse to the
               cur, "Such
                 a trial,
                   dear Sir,
                         With
                     no jury
                  or judge,
                would be
              wasting
             our
              breath."
               "Ill be
                 judge, Ill
                   be jury,"
                         Said
                    cunning
                      old Fury:
                     "Ill
                      try the
                         whole
                          cause,
                             and
                        condemn
                       you
                      to
                       death."


  You are not attending! said the Mouse to Alice severely.
What are you thinking of?

  I beg your pardon, said Alice very humbly:  you had got to
the fifth bend, I think?

  I had NOT! cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

  A knot! said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and
looking anxiously about her.  Oh, do let me help to undo it!

  I shall do nothing of the sort, said the Mouse, getting up
and walking away.  You insult me by talking such nonsense!

  I didnt mean it! pleaded poor Alice.  But youre so easily
offended, you know!

  The Mouse only growled in reply.

  Please come back and finish your story! Alice called after
it and the others all joined in chorus, Yes, please do! but
the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little
quicker.

  What a pity it wouldnt stay! sighed the Lory, as soon as it
was quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of
saying to her daughter Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you
never to lose YOUR temper!  Hold your tongue, Ma! said the
young Crab, a little snappishly.  Youre enough to try the
patience of an oyster!

  I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do! said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular.  Shed soon fetch it back!

  And who is Dinah, if I might venture to ask the question?
said the Lory.

  Alice replied eagerly, for she was always ready to talk about
her pet:  Dinahs our cat.  And shes such a capital one for
catching mice you cant think!  And oh, I wish you could see her
after the birds!  Why, shell eat a little bird as soon as look
at it!

  This speech caused a remarkable sensation among the party.
Some of the birds hurried off at once:  one the old Magpie began
wrapping itself up very carefully, remarking, I really must be
getting home the nightair doesnt suit my throat! and a Canary
called out in a trembling voice to its children, Come away, my
dears!  Its high time you were all in bed!  On various pretexts
they all moved off, and Alice was soon left alone.

  I wish I hadnt mentioned Dinah! she said to herself in a
melancholy tone.  Nobody seems to like her, down here, and Im
sure shes the best cat in the world!  Oh, my dear Dinah!  I
wonder if I shall ever see you any more!  And here poor Alice
began to cry again, for she felt very lonely and lowspirited.
In a little while, however, she again heard a little pattering of
footsteps in the distance, and she looked up eagerly, half hoping
that the Mouse had changed his mind, and was coming back to
finish his story.



                           CHAPTER IV

                The Rabbit Sends in a Little Bill


  It was the White Rabbit, trotting slowly back again, and
looking anxiously about as it went, as if it had lost something
and she heard it muttering to itself The Duchess!  The Duchess!
Oh my dear paws!  Oh my fur and whiskers!  Shell get me
executed, as sure as ferrets are ferrets!  Where CAN I have
dropped them, I wonder?  Alice guessed in a moment that it was
looking for the fan and the pair of white kid gloves, and she
very goodnaturedly began hunting about for them, but they were
nowhere to be seeneverything seemed to have changed since her
swim in the pool, and the great hall, with the glass table and
the little door, had vanished completely.

  Very soon the Rabbit noticed Alice, as she went hunting about,
and called out to her in an angry tone, Why, Mary Ann, what ARE
you doing out here?  Run home this moment, and fetch me a pair of
gloves and a fan!  Quick, now!  And Alice was so much frightened
that she ran off at once in the direction it pointed to, without
trying to explain the mistake it had made.

  He took me for his housemaid, she said to herself as she ran.
How surprised hell be when he finds out who I am!  But Id
better take him his fan and glovesthat is, if I can find them.
As she said this, she came upon a neat little house, on the door
of which was a bright brass plate with the name W. RABBIT
engraved upon it.  She went in without knocking, and hurried
upstairs, in great fear lest she should meet the real Mary Ann,
and be turned out of the house before she had found the fan and
gloves.

  How queer it seems, Alice said to herself, to be going
messages for a rabbit!  I suppose Dinahll be sending me on
messages next!  And she began fancying the sort of thing that
would happen:  "Miss Alice!  Come here directly, and get ready
for your walk!" "Coming in a minute, nurse!  But Ive got to see
that the mouse doesnt get out."  Only I dont think, Alice went
on, that theyd let Dinah stop in the house if it began ordering
people about like that!

  By this time she had found her way into a tidy little room with
a table in the window, and on it as she had hoped a fan and two
or three pairs of tiny white kid gloves:  she took up the fan and
a pair of the gloves, and was just going to leave the room, when
her eye fell upon a little bottle that stood near the looking
glass.  There was no label this time with the words DRINK ME,
but nevertheless she uncorked it and put it to her lips.  I know
SOMETHING interesting is sure to happen, she said to herself,
whenever I eat or drink anything so Ill just see what this
bottle does.  I do hope itll make me grow large again, for
really Im quite tired of being such a tiny little thing!

  It did so indeed, and much sooner than she had expected:
before she had drunk half the bottle, she found her head pressing
against the ceiling, and had to stoop to save her neck from being
broken.  She hastily put down the bottle, saying to herself
Thats quite enoughI hope I shant grow any moreAs it is, I
cant get out at the doorI do wish I hadnt drunk quite so
much!

  Alas! it was too late to wish that!  She went on growing, and
growing, and very soon had to kneel down on the floor:  in
another minute there was not even room for this, and she tried
the effect of lying down with one elbow against the door, and the
other arm curled round her head.  Still she went on growing, and,
as a last resource, she put one arm out of the window, and one
foot up the chimney, and said to herself Now I can do no more,
whatever happens.  What WILL become of me?

  Luckily for Alice, the little magic bottle had now had its full
effect, and she grew no larger:  still it was very uncomfortable,
and, as there seemed to be no sort of chance of her ever getting
out of the room again, no wonder she felt unhappy.

  It was much pleasanter at home, thought poor Alice, when one
wasnt always growing larger and smaller, and being ordered about
by mice and rabbits.  I almost wish I hadnt gone down that
rabbitholeand yetand yetits rather curious, you know,
this sort of life!  I do wonder what CAN have happened to me!
When I used to read fairytales, I fancied that kind of thing
never happened, and now here I am in the middle of one!  There
ought to be a book written about me, that there ought!  And when
I grow up, Ill write onebut Im grown up now, she added in a
sorrowful tone at least theres no room to grow up any more
HERE.

  But then, thought Alice, shall I NEVER get any older than I
am now?  Thatll be a comfort, one waynever to be an old woman
but thenalways to have lessons to learn!  Oh, I shouldnt like
THAT!

  Oh, you foolish Alice! she answered herself.  How can you
learn lessons in here?  Why, theres hardly room for YOU, and no
room at all for any lessonbooks!

  And so she went on, taking first one side and then the other,
and making quite a conversation of it altogether but after a few
minutes she heard a voice outside, and stopped to listen.

  Mary Ann!  Mary Ann! said the voice.  Fetch me my gloves
this moment!  Then came a little pattering of feet on the
stairH.  ZORXV PMVD RG DZH GSV IZYYRG XLNRMT GL OLLP ULI SVI, ZMW
