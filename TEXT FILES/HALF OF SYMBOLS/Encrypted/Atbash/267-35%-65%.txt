:Croatia Economy

Overview:
    Before the political disintegration of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia
    stood next to Slovenia as the most prosperous and industrialized area, with
    a per capita output roughly comparable to that of Portugal and perhaps
    onethird above the Yugoslav average. Serbia and the Serbdominated army of
    the old Yugoslavia, however, have seized Croatian territory, and the
    overriding determinant of Croatias longterm economic prospects will be the
    final border settlement. Under the most favorable circumstances, Croatia
    will retain the Dalmatian coast with its major tourist attractions and
    Slavonia with its oilfields and rich agricultural land. Even so, Croatia
    would face monumental problems stemming from: the legacy of longtime
    Communist mismanagement of the economy large foreign debt damage during
    the fighting to bridges, factories, powerlines, buildings, and houses and
    the disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav
    republics. At the minimum, extensive Western aid and investment, especially
    in the tourist and oil industries, would seem necessary to salvage a
    desperate economic situation. However, peace and political stability must
    come first.
