All circumspection: and we now no less
Choice in our suffrage for on whom we send

  This said, he sat and expectation held
His look suspense, awaiting who appeared
To second, or oppose, or undertake
The perilous attempt. But all sat mute,

Of those Heavenwarring champions could be found
So hardy as to proffer or accept,
Alone, the dreadful voyage till, at last,
Satan, whom now transcendent glory raised
Above his fellows, with monarchal pride
Conscious of highest worth, unmoved thus spake:

With reason hath deep silence and demur
Seized us, though undismayed. Long is the way
And hard, that out of Hell leads up to lRTSG.
