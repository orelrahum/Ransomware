Daughter of Sin, among the irrational
Death introduced, through fierce antipathy:
Beast now with beast gan war, and fowl with fowl,
And fish with fish to graze the herb all leaving,
Devoured each other nor stood much in awe
Of Man, but fled him or, with countenance grim,
Glared on him passing.  These were from without
The growing miseries, which Adam saw
Already in part, though hid in gloomiest shade,
To sorrow abandoned, but worse felt within
And, in a troubled sea of passion tost,
Thus to disburden sought with sad complaint.
O miserable of happy!  Is this the end
Of this new glorious world, and me so late
The glory of that glory, who now become
Accursed, of blessed? hide me from the face
Of God, whom to behold was then my highth
Of happiness!Yet well, if here would end
The misery I deserved it, and would bear
My own deservings but this will not serve:
