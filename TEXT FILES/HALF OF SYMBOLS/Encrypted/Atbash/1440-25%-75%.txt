:Iceland Economy

Overview:
    Icelands prosperous Scandinaviantype economy is basically capitalistic,
    but with extensive welfare measures, low unemployment, and comparatively
    even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry, which provides nearly 75 of export earnings. In the absence of
    other natural resources, Icelands economy is vulnerable to changing world
    fish prices. The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
    in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
    plant. The conservative governments economic priorities include reducing
    the budget and current account deficits, containing inflation, revising
    agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and tying the
    krona to the ECs European currency unit in 1993. The fishing industries 
    notably the shrimp industry  are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
    mergers. Inflation has continued to drop sharply from 20 in 1989 to about
    7.5 in 1991 and possibly 3 in 1992, while unemployment is expected to
    increase to 2.5. GDP is expected to contract by nearly 4 in 1992.

:India Economy

Overview:
    Indias economy is a mixture of traditional village farming and handicrafts,
    modern agriculture, old and new branches of industry, and a multitude of
    support services. It presents both the entrepreneurial skills and drives of
    the capitalist system and widespread government intervention of the
    socialist mold. Growth of 45 annually in the 1980s has softened the impact
    of population growth on unemployment, social tranquility, and the
    environment. Agricultural output has continued to expand, reflecting the
    greater use of modern farming techniques and improved seed that have helped
    to make India selfsufficient in food grains and a net agricultural
    exporter. However, tens of millions of villagers, partRXFOZIOB RM GSV HLFGS,
