wouldnt talk about wasting IT.  Its HIM.

  I dont know what you mean, said Alice.

  Of course you dont! the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously.  I dare say you never even spoke to Time!

  Perhaps not, Alice cautiously replied:  but I know I have to
beat time when I learn music.

  Ah! that accounts for it, said the Hatter.  He wont stand
beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, hed do
almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose
it were nine oclock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:
youd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
clock in a twinkling!  Halfpast one, time for dinner!
