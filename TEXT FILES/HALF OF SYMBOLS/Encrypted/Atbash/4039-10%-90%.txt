To whom thus Adam gratefully replied.
Ascend, I follow thee, safe Guide, the path
Thou leadest me and to the hand of Heaven submit,
However chastening to the evil turn
My obvious breast arming to overcome
By suffering, and earn rest from labour won,
If so I may attain.  So both ascend
In the visions of God.  It was a hill,
