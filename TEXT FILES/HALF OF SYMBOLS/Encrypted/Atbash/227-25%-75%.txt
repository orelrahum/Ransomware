:Australia Economy

Overview:
    Australia has a prosperous Westernstyle capitalist economy, with a per

    primary products, so that, as happened during 198384, a downturn in world
    commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy. The government is
    pushing for increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
    international markets continues to be severe.
