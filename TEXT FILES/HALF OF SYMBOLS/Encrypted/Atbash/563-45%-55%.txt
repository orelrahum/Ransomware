developed out of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae project and designed for
the use of classical scholars.  There are perhaps 400 IBYCUS computers in
the country, most of which are in university classics departments.
Ultimately, it is anticipated that the CDROM edition of the Founding
Fathers documents will run on any IBMcompatible or Macintosh computer
with a CDROM drive.  Numerous changes in the software will also occur
before the project is completed.  Editors note: an IBYCUS was
unavailable to demonstrate the CDROM.

                                 


DISCUSSION  Several additional features of WPP clarified 


Discussion following TWOHIGs presentation served to clarify several
additional features, including 1 that the projects primary
intellectual product consists in the electronic transcription of the
material 2 that the text transmitted to the CDROM people is not
marked up 3 that cataloging and subjectindexing of the material
remain to be worked out though at this point material can be retrieved
by name and 4 that because all the searching is done in the hardware,
the IBYCUS is designed to read a CDROM which contains only sequential
text files.  Technically, it then becomes very easy to read the material
off and put it on another device.
