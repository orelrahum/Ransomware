                      Who Stole the Tarts?


  The King and Queen of Hearts were seated on their throne when
they arrived, with a great crowd assembled about themall sorts
of little birds and beasts, as well as the whole pack of cards:
the Knave was standing before them, in chains, with a soldier on
each side to guard him and near the King was the White Rabbit,
with a trumpet in one hand, and a scroll of parchment in the
other.  In the very middle of the court was a table, with a large
dish of tarts upon it:  they looked so good, that it made Alice

some of them were animals, and some were birds, I suppose they
are the jurors.  She said this last word two or three times over
to herself, being rather proud of it:  for she thought, and
rightly too, that very few little girls of her age knew the
meaning of it at all.  However, jurymen would have done just
as well.

  The twelve jurors were all writing very busily on slates.
What are they doing?  Alice whispered to the Gryphon.  They
cant have anything to put down yet, before the trials begun.
