With reverence I must meet, and thou retire.
He ended: and the ArchAngel soon drew nigh,
Not in his shape celestial, but as man
Clad to meet man over his lucid arms
A military vest of purple flowed,
Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain
Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old
In time of truce Iris had dipt the woof
His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime
In manhood where youth ended by his side,
As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword,
Satans dire dread and in his hand the spear.
Adam bowed low he, kingly, from his state
Inclined not, but his coming thus declared.
Adam, Heavens high behest no preface needs:
Sufficient that thy prayers are heard and Death,
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,
