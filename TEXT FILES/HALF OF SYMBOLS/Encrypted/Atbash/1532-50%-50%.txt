little way off, and she swam nearer to make out what it was:  at
first she thought it must be a walrus or hippopotamus, but then
she remembered how small she was now, and she soon made out that
it was only a mouse that had slipped in like herself.

  Would it be of any use, now, thought Alice, to speak to this
mouse?  Everything is so outoftheway down here, that I should
think very likely it can talk:  at any rate, theres no harm in
trying.  So she began:  O Mouse, do you know the way out of
this pool?  I am very tired of swimming about here, O Mouse!
Alice thought this must be the right way of speaking to a mouse:
she had never done such a thing before, but she remembered having
seen in her brothers Latin Grammar, A mouseof a mouseto a
mousea mouseO mouse!  The Mouse looked at her rather
inquisitively, and seemed to her to wink with one of its little
eyes, but it said nothing.

  Perhaps it doesnt understand English, thought Alice I
daresay its a French mouse, come over with William the
Conqueror.  For, with all her knowledge of history, Alice had
no very clear notion how long ago anything had happened.  So she
began again:  Ou est ma chatte? which was the first sentence in
her French lessonbook.  The Mouse gave a sudden leap out of the
water, and seemed to quiver all over with fright.  Oh, I beg
your pardon! cried Alice hastily, afraid that she had hurt the
poor animals feelings.  I quite forgot you didnt like cats.

  Not like cats! cried the Mouse, in a shrill, passionate
voice.  Would YOU like cats if you were me?
