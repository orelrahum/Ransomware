SCENE II	The forest.

ORLANDO	Ist possible that on so little acquaintance you
	should like her? that but seeing you should love
	her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should
	grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?

OLIVER	Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the
	poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden
	wooing, nor her sudden consenting but say with me,
	I love Aliena say with her that she loves me
	consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
	shall be to your good for my fathers house and all
	the revenue that was old Sir Rowlands will I
	estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.

ORLANDO	You have my consent. Let your wedding be tomorrow:
	thither will I invite the duke and alls contented
	followers. Go you and prepare Aliena for look
	you, here comes my Rosalind.

	Enter ROSALIND

ROSALIND	God save you, brother.

OLIVER	And you, fair sister.

	Exit

ROSALIND	O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee
	wear thy heart in a scarf!

ORLANDO	It is my arm.

ROSALIND	I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
	of a lion.

ORLANDO	Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.

ROSALIND	Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
	swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?

ORLANDO	Ay, and greater wonders than that.

ROSALIND	O, I know where you are: nay, tis true: there was
	never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
	and Caesars thrasonical brag of I came, saw, and
	overcame: for your brother and my sister no sooner
	met but they looked, no sooner looPVW YFG GSVB
