the Internet if just an ASCII file is desired, LEBRON illustrated the
speedy editorial process and the coding of the document using SGML tags
after it has been accepted for publication.  She also gave an illustrated
tour of the journal, its searchandretrieval capabilities in particular,
but also including problems associated with scanning in illustrations,
and the importance of onscreen alerts to the medical profession re
retractions or corrections, or more frequently, editorials, letters to
the editors, or followup reports.  She closed by inviting the audience
to join AAAS on 1 July, when OJCCT was scheduled to go online.
