      At NAL, the throughput rate of the scanning process for paper,
     page by page, performing OCR, ranges from 300 to 600 pages per day

     is not known.  This is for scanning from bound books, which is much
     slower.

     and bring them down to the workstation itself and the other was
     network usage.
