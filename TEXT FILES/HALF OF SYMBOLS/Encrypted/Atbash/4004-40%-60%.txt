That burden, heavier than the earth to bear
Than all the world much heavier, though divided
With that bad Woman?  Thus, what thou desirest,
And what thou fearest, alike destroys all hope
Of refuge, and concludes thee miserable
Beyond all past example and future
To Satan only like both crime and doom.
O Conscience! into what abyss of fears
And horrours hast thou driven me out of which
I find no way, from deep to deeper plunged!
Thus Adam to himself lamented loud,
Through the still night not now, as ere Man fell,
Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air
Accompanied with damps, and dreadful gloom
Which to his evil conscience represented
All things with double terrour:  LM GSV TILFMW
