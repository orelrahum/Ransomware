its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,
in the pictures of him, while the rest waited in silence.  At

prizes.

  But who is to give the prizes? quite a chorus of voices
asked.

  Why, SHE, of course, said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with
one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her,
calling out in a confused way, Prizes! Prizes!

  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand
in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, luckily the salt
water had not got into it, and handed them round as prizes.
There was exactly one apiece all round.

  But she must have a prize herself, you know, said the Mouse.

  Of course, the Dodo replied very gravely.  What else have
you got in your pocket? SV DVMG LM, GFIMRMT GL ZORXV.
