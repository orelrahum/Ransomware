    keep its economy afloat. Although one of the governments main priorities is
    to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve for years
    to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and
    diversify the economy through tax reform and an expansionary 1992 budget.
    Forecasters predict that economic growth will rise slightly in 1992 because
    of publicsector expansion and moderate improvements in private investment
    and demand. Inflation will remain about 3, while unemployment continues at
    record levels of over 5 because of the weakness of the economy outside the
    oil sector. Oslo, a member of the European Free Trade Area, is continuing to
    deregulate and harmonize with EC regulations to prepare for the European
    Economic Area EEA  which creates a ECEFTA market with free movement of
    capital, goods, services, and labor  which takes effect in 1993.
