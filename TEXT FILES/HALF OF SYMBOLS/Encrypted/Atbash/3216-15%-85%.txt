PHEBE	                  Why, that were covetousness.
	Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
	And yet it is not that I bear thee love
	But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
	Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
	I will endure, and Ill employ thee too:
	But do not look for further recompense
	Than thine own gladness that thou art employd.

SILVIUS	So holy and so perfect is my love,
	And I in such a poverty of grace,
	That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
	To glean the broken ears after the man
