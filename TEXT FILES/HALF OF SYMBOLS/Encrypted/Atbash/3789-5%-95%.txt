Or with repose and such discourse bring on,
As may advise him of his happy state,
Happiness in his power left free to will,
Left to his own free will, his will though free,
Yet mutable whence warn him to beware
He swerve not, too secure:  Tell him withal
His danger, and from whom what enemy,
Late fallen himself from Heaven, is plotting now
The fall of others from like state of bliss
By violence? no, for that shall be withstood
But by deceit and lies:  This let him know,
Lest, wilfully transgressing, he pretend
Surprisal, unadmonished, unforewarned.
So spake the Eternal Father, and fulfilled
All justice:  Nor delayed the winged Saint
After his charge received but from among
Thousand celestial Ardours, where he stood
Veiled with his gorgeous wings, up springing light,
Flew through the midst of Heaven the angelick quires,
On each hand parting, to his speed gave way
Through all the empyreal road till, at the gate
Of Heaven arrived, the gate selfopened wide
On golden hinges turning, as by work
Divine the sovran Architect had framed.
From hence no cloud, or, to obstruct his sight,
Star interposed, howevVI HNZOO SV HVVH,
