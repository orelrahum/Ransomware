Established, such delight hath God in Men
Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes
Among them to set up his tabernacle
The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed
Of cedar, overlaid with gold therein
An ark, and in the ark his testimony,
The records of his covenant over these
A mercyseat of gold, between the wings
Of two bright Cherubim before him burn
Seven lamps as in a zLWRZXP IVKIVHVMGRMT
