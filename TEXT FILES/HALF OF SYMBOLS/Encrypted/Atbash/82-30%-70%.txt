:Paraguay Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25 of GDP, employs
    about 45 of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has
    no known significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
    hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared
    with the boom period of 197681, when real GDP grew at an average annual
    rate of nearly 11. During the period 198286 real GDP fell in three of five
    years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32, and foreign debt rose.
    Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the
    completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak
    international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy
    experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and
    stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery
    continued through 1990, on the strength of bumper crops in 198889. In a
    major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in
    March 1991 joined the Southern Cone Common Market MERCOSUR, which includes
    Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. During 1991 the government began to more
    seriously address its arrearages with international creditors and its
    domestic fiscal problems. Inflation was cut in third, but the foreign trade
    deficit widened to more than 1 billion. For the long run, the government
    must press forward with general marketoriented economic reforms.

:Peru Economy

Overview:
    The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented, with a large
    dose of government ownership remaining in mining, energy, and banking. In
    the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita
    output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World
    Bank support in the mid1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity
    program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in
    July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
    activity, but the slide halted late in the year, and output rose 2.4 in
    1991. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
    government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the
    singledigit level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since
    mid1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
    in September 1991, and, although it faces 14 billion in arrears on its
    external debt, is working to pay some 1.8 billion of these to the IMF and
    World Bank by 1993.
