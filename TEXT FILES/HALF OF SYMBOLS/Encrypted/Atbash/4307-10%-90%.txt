:Bangladesh Economy

Overview:
    Bangladesh is one of the poorest nations in the world. The economy is based
    on the output of a narrow range of agricultural products, such as jute,
    which is the main cash crop and major source of export earnings, and rice.
    Bangladesh is hampered by a relative lack of natural resources, population
    growth of more than 2 a year, largescale unemployment, and a limited
    infrastructure furthermore, it is highly vulnerable to natural disasters.
    Despite these constraints, real GDP growth averaged about 3.5 annually
    during 198589. A strong agricultural performance in FY90 pushed the growth
    rate up to 6.2, and FY91 saw further, though smaller, increases in output.
    Alleviation of poverty remains the cornerstone of the governments
    development strategy.
