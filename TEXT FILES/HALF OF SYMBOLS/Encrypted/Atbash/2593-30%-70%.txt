:Portugal Economy

Overview:
    Although Portugal has experienced strong growth since joining the EC in 1986
     at least 4 each year through 1990  it remains one of the poorest

    restructuring and modernizing the economy and in 1989 embarked on a major
    privatization program. The global slowdown and tight monetary policies to
    counter inflation caused growth to slow in 1991, but it is likely to recover
    in 1992.
