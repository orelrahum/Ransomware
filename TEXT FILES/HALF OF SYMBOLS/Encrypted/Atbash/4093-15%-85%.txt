Gliding meteorous, as eveningmist
Risen from a river oer the marish glides,
And gathers ground fast at the labourers heel
Homeward returning.  High in front advanced,
The brandished sword of God before them blazed,
Fierce as a comet which with torrid heat,
And vapour as the Libyan air adust,
Began to parch that temperate clime whereat
In either hand the hastening Angel caught
Our lingering parents, and to the eastern gate
Led them direct, and down the cliff as fast
To the subjected plain then disappeared.
They, looking back, all the eastern side beheld
Of Paradise, so late their happy seat,
Waved over by that flaming brand the gate
With dreadful faces thronged, and fiery arms:
Some natural tears they dropt, but wiped them soon
The world was all before them, where to choose
Their place of rest, and Providence their guide:
They, hand in hand, with wandering steps and slow,
Through Eden took their solitary way.
