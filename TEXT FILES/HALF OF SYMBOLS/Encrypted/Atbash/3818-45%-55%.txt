Remains thee, aided by this host of friends,
Back on thy foes more glorious to return,
Than scorned thou didst depart and to subdue
By force, who reason for their law refuse,
Right reason for their law, and for their King
Messiah, who by right of merit reigns.
Go, Michael, of celestial armies prince,
And thou, in military prowess next,
Gabriel, lead forth to battle these my sons
Invincible lead forth my armed Saints,
By thousands and by millions, ranged for fight,
Equal in number to that Godless crew
Rebellious:  Them with fire and hostile arms
Fearless assault and, to the brow of Heaven
Pursuing, drive them out from God and bliss,
