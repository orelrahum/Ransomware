This annual humbling certain numbered days,
To dash their pride, and joy, for Man seduced.
However, some tradition they dispersed
Among the Heathen, of their purchase got,
And fabled how the Serpent, whom they called
Ophion, with Eurynome, the wide
Encroaching Eve perhaps, had first the rule
Of high Olympus thence by Saturn driven
And Ops, ere yet Dictaean Jove was born.
Mean while in Paradise the hellish pair
Too soon arrived Sin, there in power before,
Once actual now in body, and to dwell
Habitual habitant behind her Death,
Close following pace for pace, not mounted yet
On his pale horse: to whom Sin thus began.
Second of Satan sprung, allconquering Death!
What thinkest thou of our empire now, though earned
With travel difficult, not better far
Than still at Hells dark threshold to have sat watch,
Unnamed, undreaded, and thyself half starved?
Whom thus the Sinborn monster answered soon.
To me, who with eternal famine pine,
Alike is Hell, or Paradise, or Heaven
There best, where most with ravine I may meet
Which here, though plenteous, all too little seems
To stuff this maw, this vast unhidebound corps.
To whom the incestuous mother thus replied.
Thou therefore on these herbs, and fruits, and flowers,
Feed first on each beast next, and fish, and fowl
No homely morsels! and, whatever thing
The sithe of Time mows down, devour unspared
Till I, in Man residing, through the race,
His thoughts, his looks, words, actions, all infect
And season him thy last and sweetest prey.
This said, they both betook them several ways,
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make
All kinds, and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later which the Almighty seeing,
From his transcendent seat the Saints among,
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.
See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance
To waste and havock yonder world, which I
So fair and good created and had still
Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man
Let in these wasteful furies, who impute
Folly to me so doth the Prince of Hell
And his adherents, that with so much ease
I suffer them to enter and possess
A place so heavenly and, conniving, seem
To gratify my scornful enemies,
That laugh, as if, transported with some fit
Of passion, I tL GSVN SZW JFRGGVW ZOO,
