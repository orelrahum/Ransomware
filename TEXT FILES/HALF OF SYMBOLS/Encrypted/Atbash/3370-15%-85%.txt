organizations.  In short, OJCCT represents the process of scholarly
publishing on line.

LEBRON next discussed several practices the online environment shares
with traditional publishing on hard copyfor example, peer review of
manuscriptsthat are highly important in the academic world.  LEBRON
noted in particular the implications of citation counts for tenure
committees and grants committees.  In the traditional hardcopy
environment, citation counts are readily demonstrable, whereas the
online environment represents an ethereal medium to most academics.

LEBRON remarked several technical and behavioral barriers to electronic
publishing, for instance, the problems in transmission created by special
characters or by complex graphics and halftones.  In addition, she noted
economic limitations such as the storage costs of maintaining back issues
and market or audience education.

Manuscripts cannot be uploaded to OJCCT, LEBRON explained, because it is
not a bulletin board or Email, forms of electronic transmission of
information that have created an ambience clouding peoples understanding
of what the journal is attempting to do.  OJCCT, DSRXS KFYORHSVH
