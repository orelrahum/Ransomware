:New Zealand Economy

Overview:
    Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian economy dependent
    on a guaranteed British market to an open free market economy that can
    compete on the global scene. The government has hoped that dynamic growth
    would boost real incomes, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the
    expansion of welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: inflation is
    down from doubledigit levels, but growth has been sluggish and
    unemployment, always a highly sensitive issue, has exceeded 10 since May
    1991. In 1988, GDP fell by 1, in 1989 grew by a moderate 2.4, and was flat
    in 199091.
