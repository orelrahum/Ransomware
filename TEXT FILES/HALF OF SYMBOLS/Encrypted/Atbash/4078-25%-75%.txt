Thou hast revealed those chiefly, which concern
Just Abraham and his seed: now first I find
Mine eyes trueopening, and my heart much eased
Erewhile perplexed with thoughts, what would become
Of me and all mankind:  But now I see
His day, in whom all nations shall be blest
Favour unmerited by me, who sought
Forbidden knowledge by forbidden means.
This yet I apprehend not, why to those
Among whom God will deign to dwell on earth
So many and so various laws are given
So many laws argue so many sins
Among them how can God with such reside?
To whom thus Michael.  Doubt not but that sin
