From a fat meadow ground or fleecy flock,
Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain,
Their booty scarce with life the shepherds fly,
But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray
With cruel tournament the squadrons join
Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies
With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field,
Deserted:  Others to a city strong
Lay siege, encamped by battery, scale, and mine,
Assaulting others from the wall defend
With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire
On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds.
In other part the sceptered heralds call
To council, in the citygates anon
Grayheaded men and grave, with warriours mixed,
Assemble, and harangues are heard but soon,
In factious opposition till at last,
Of middle age one rising, eminent
In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong,
Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace,
And judgement from above: him old and young
Exploded, and had seized with violent hands,
Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
Unseen amid the throng: so violence
Proceeded, and oppression, and swordlaw,
Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.
Adam was all in tears, and to his guide
Lamenting turned full sad O!what are these,
Deaths ministers, not men? who thus deal death
Inhumanly to men, and multiply
Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
His brother: for of whom such massacre
Make they, but of their brethren men of men
