Amber, and colours of the showery arch.
He, in celestial panoply all armed
Of radiant Urim, work divinely wrought,
Ascended at his right hand Victory
Sat eaglewinged beside him hung his bow
And quiver with threebolted thunder stored
And from about him fierce effusion rolled
Of smoke, and bickering flame, and sparkles dire:
Attended with ten thousand thousand Saints,
He onward came far off his coming shone
And twenty thousand I their number heard
Chariots of God, half on each hand, were seen
He on the wings of Cherub rode sublime
On the crystalline sky, in sapphire throned,
Illustrious far and wide but by his own
First seen:  Them unexpected joy surprised,
When the great ensign of Messiah blazed
Aloft by Angels borne, his sign in Heaven
Under whose conduct Michael soon reduced
His army, circumfused on either wing,
Under their Head imbodied all in one.
Before him Power Divine his way prepared
At his command the uprooted hills retired
Each to his place they heard his voice, and went
Obsequious Heaven his wonted face renewed,
And with fresh flowerets hill and valley smiled.
This saw his hapless foes, but stood obdured,
And to rebellious fight rallied their Powers,
Insensate, hope conceiving from despair.
In heavenly Spirits could such perverseness dwell?
But to convince the proud what signs avail,
Or wonders move the obdurate to relent?
They, hardened more by what might most reclaim,
Grieving to see his glory, at the sight
Took envy and, aspiring to his highth,
Stood reembattled fierce, by force or fraud
Weening to prosper, and at length prevail
Against God and Messiah, or to fall
In universal ruin last and now
To final battle drew, disdaining flight,
Or faint retreat when the great Son of God
To all his host on either hand thus spake.
