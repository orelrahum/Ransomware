dodged behind a great thistle, to keep herself from being run
over and the moment she appeared on the other side, the puppy
made another rush at the stick, and tumbled head over heels in
its hurry to get hold of it then Alice, thinking it was very
like having a game of play with a carthorse, and expecting every
moment to be trampled under its feet, ran round the thistle
again then the puppy began a series of short charges at the
stick, running a very little way forwards each time and a long
way back, and barking hoarsely all the while, till at last it sat
down a good way off, panting, with its tongue hanging out of its
mouth, and its great eyes half shut.

  This seemed to Alice a good opportunity for making her escape
so she set off at once, and ran till she was quite tired and out

distance.

  And yet what a dear little puppy it was! said Alice, as she
leant against a buttercup to rest herself, and fanned herself
with one of the leaves:  I should have liked teaching it tricks
very much, ifif Id only been the right size to do it!  Oh

  The great question certainly was, what?  Alice looked all round
her at the flowers and the blades of grass, but she did not see

the circumstances.  There was a large mushroom growing near her,
about the same height as herself and when she had looked under
it, and on both sides of it, and behind it, it occurred to her
that she might as well look and see what was on the top of it.

  She stretched herself up on tiptoe, and peeped over the edge of
