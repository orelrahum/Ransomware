ACT IV



SCENE III	The forest.


	Enter ROSALIND and CELIA

ROSALIND	How say you now? Is it not past two oclock? and
	here much Orlando!

CELIA	I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
	hath taen his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
	sleep. Look, who comes here.

	Enter SILVIUS

SILVIUS	My errand is to you, fair youth
	My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
	I know not the contents but, as I guess
	By the stern brow and waspish action
	Which she did use as she was writing of it,
	It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
	I am but as a guiltless messenger.

ROSALIND	Patience herself would startle at this letter
	And play the swaggerer bear this, bear all:
	She says I am not fair, that I lack manners
	She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
	Were man as rare as phoenix. Ods my will!
	Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
	Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
	This is a letter of your own device.

SILVIUS	No, I protest, I know not the contents:
	Phebe did write it.

ROSALIND	Come, come, you are a fool
	And turnd into the extremity of love.
