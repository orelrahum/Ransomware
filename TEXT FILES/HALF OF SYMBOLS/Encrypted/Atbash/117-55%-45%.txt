  Alice tried to fancy to herself what such an extraordinary ways
of living would be like, but it puzzled her too much, so she went
on:  But why did they live at the bottom of a well?

  Take some more tea, the March Hare said to Alice, very
earnestly.

  Ive had nothing yet, Alice replied in an offended tone, so
I cant take more.

  You mean you cant take LESS, said the Hatter:  its very
easy to take MORE than nothing.

  Nobody asked YOUR opinion, said Alice.

  Whos making personal remarks now? the Hatter asked
triumphantly.

  Alice did not quite know what to say to this:  so she helped
herself to some tea and breadandbutter, and then turned to the
Dormouse, and repeated her question.  Why did they live at the
bottom of a well?

  The Dormouse again took a minute or two to think about it, and
then said, It was a treaclewell.

  Theres no such thing!  Alice was beginning very angrily, but
the Hatter and the March Hare went Sh! sh! and the Dormouse
sulkily remarked, If you cant be civil, youd better finish the
story for yourself.

  No, please go on! Alice said very humbly I wont interrupt
again.  I dare say there may be ONE.

  One, indeed! said the Dormouse indignantly.  However, he
consented to go on.  And so these three little sistersthey
were learning to draw, you know

  What did they draw? said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

  Treacle, said the Dormouse, without considering at all this
time.

  I want a clean cup, interrupted the Hatter:  lets all move
one place on.

  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the
March Hare moved into the Dormouses place, and Alice rather
unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the
only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a
good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset
the milkjug into his plate.

  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began
very cautiously:  But I dont understand.  Where did they draw
the treacle from?

  You can draw water out of a waterwell, said the Hatter so
I should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh,
stupid?

  But they were IN the well, Alice said to the Dormouse, not
choosing to notice this last remark.

  Of course they were, said the Dormouse well in.

  This answer so confused poor Alice, that she let the Dormouse
go on for some time without interrupting it.

  They were learning to draw, the Dormouse went on, yawning and
rubbing its eyes, for it was getting very sleepy and they drew
all manner of thingseverything that begins with an M

  Why with an M? said Alice.

  Why not? said the March Hare.

  Alice was silent.

  The Dormouse had closed its eyes by this time, and was going
off into a doze but, on being pinched by the Hatter, it woke up
again with a little shriek, and went on:  that begins with an
M, such as mousetraps, and the moon, and memory, and muchness
you know you say things are "much of a muchness"did you ever
see such a thing as a drawing of a muchness?

  Really, now you ask me, said Alice, very much confused, I
dont think

  Then you shouldnt talk, said the Hatter.

  This piece of rudeness was more than Alice could bear:  she got
up in great disgust, and walked off the Dormouse fell asleep
instantly, and neither of the others took the least notice of her
going, though she looked back once or twice, half hoping that
they would call after her:  the last time she saw them, they were
trying to put the Dormouse into the teapot.

  At any rate Ill never go THERE again! said Alice as she
picked her way through the wood.  Its the stupidest teaparty I
ever was at in all my life!

  Just as she said this, she noticed that one of the trees had a
door leading right into it.  Thats very curious! she thought.
But everythings curious today.  I think I may as well go in at
once.  And in she went.

  Once more she found herself in the long hall, and close to the
little glass table.  Now, Ill manage better this time, she
said to herself, and began by taking the little golden key, and
unlocking the door that led into the garden.  Then she went to
work nibbling at the mushroom she had kept a piece of it in her
pocked till she was about a foot high:  then she walked down the
little passage:  and THENshe found herself at last in the
beautiful garden, among the bright flowerbeds and the cool
fountains.
