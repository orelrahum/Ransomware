ROSALIND	So was I when your highness took his dukedom
	So was I when your highness banishd him:
	Treason is not inherited, my lord
	Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
	Whats that to me? my father was no traitor:
	Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
	To think my poverty is treacherous.

CELIA	Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

DUKE FREDERICK	Ay, Celia we stayd her for your sake,
	Else had she with her father ranged along.

CELIA	I did not then entreat to have her stay
	It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
	I was too young that time GL EZOFV SVI
