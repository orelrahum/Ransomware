ROSALIND	                  I do beseech your grace,
	Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
	If with myself I hold intelligence
	Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
	If that I do not dream or be not frantic,
	As I do trust I am notthen, dear uncle,
	Never so much as in a thought unborn
	Did I offend your highness.

DUKE FREDERICK	Thus do all traitors:
	If their purgation did consist in words,
	They are as innocent as grace itself:
	Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.

ROSALIND	Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
	Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.

DUKE FREDERICK	Thou art thy fathers daughter theres enough.

ROSALIND	So was I when your highness took his dukedom
	So was I when your highness banishd him:
	Treason is not inherited, my lord
	Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
	Whats that to me? my father was no traitor:
	Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
	To think my poverty is treacherous.

CELIA	Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

DUKE FREDERICK	Ay, Celia we stayd her for your sake,
	Else had she with her father ranged along.

CELIA	I did not then entreat to have her stay
	It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
	I was too young that time to value her
	But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
	Why so am I we still have slept together,
	Rose at an instant, learnd, playd, eat together,
	And wheresoever we went, like Junos swans,
	Still we went coupled and inseparable.

DUKE FREDERICK	She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness,
	Her very silence and her patience
	Speak to the people, and they pity her.
	Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name
	And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
	When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
	Firm and irrevocable is my doom
