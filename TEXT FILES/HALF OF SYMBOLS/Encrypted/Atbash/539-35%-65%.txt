	And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND	And I for no woman.

SILVIUS	It is to be all made of fantasy,
	All made of passion and all made of wishes,
	All adoration, duty, and observance,
	All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
	All purity, all trial, all observance
	And so am I for Phebe.

PHEBE	And so am I for Ganymede.

ORLANDO	And so am I for Rosalind.

ROSALIND	And so am I for no woman.

PHEBE	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

SILVIUS	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

ORLANDO	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?

ROSALIND	Who do you speak to, Why blame you me to love you?

ORLANDO	To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.

ROSALIND	Pray you, no more of this tis like the howling
	of Irish wolves against the moon.

	To SILVIUS

	I will help you, if I can:

	To PHEBE

	I would love you, if I could. Tomorrow meet me all together.

	To PHEBE

	I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and Ill be
	married tomorrow:

	To ORLANDO

	I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
	shall be married tomorrow:

	To SILVIUS

	I will content you, if what pleases you contents
	you, and you shall be married tomorrow.

	To ORLANDO
