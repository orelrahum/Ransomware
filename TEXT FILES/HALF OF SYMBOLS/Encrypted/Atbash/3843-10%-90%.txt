From those deepthroated engines belched, whose roar
Embowelled with outrageous noise the air,
And all her entrails tore, disgorging foul
Their devilish glut, chained thunderbolts and hail
Of iron globes which, on the victor host
Levelled, with such impetuous fury smote,
That, whom they hit, none on their feet might stand,
Though standing else as rocks, but down they fell
By thousands, Angel on ArchAngel rolled
The sooner for their arms unarmed, they might
Have easily, as Spirits, evaded swift
By quick contraction or remove but now
Foul dissipation followed, and forced rout
Nor served it to relax their serried files.
What should they do? if on they rushed, repulse
Repeated, and indecent overthrow
Doubled, would render them yet more despised,
And to their foes a laughter for in view
Stood ranked of Seraphim another row,
In posture to displode their second tire
Of thunder:  Back defeated to return
They worse abhorred.  Satan beheld their plight,
And to his mates thus in derision called.
O Friends! why come not on these victors proud
Ere while they fierce were coming and when we,
To entertain them fair with open front
And breast, what could we more? propounded terms
Of composition, straight they changed their minds,
Flew off, and into strange vagaries fell,
As they would dance yet ULI Z WZMXV GSVB HVVNVW
