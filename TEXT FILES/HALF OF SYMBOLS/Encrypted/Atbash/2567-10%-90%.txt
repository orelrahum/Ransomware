:Papua New Guinea Economy

    Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation
    has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of developing an
    infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85 of the
    population. Mining of numerous deposits, including copper and gold, accounts
    for about 60 of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and
    development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy.
    Robust growth in 1991 was led by the mining sector the opening of a large
    new gold mine featured in the advance.
