  What did they draw? said Alice, quite forgetting her promise.

  Treacle, said the Dormouse, without considering at all this
time.

  I want a clean cup, interrupted the Hatter:  lets all move
one place on.

  He moved on as he spoke, and the Dormouse followed him:  the
March Hare moved into the Dormouses place, and Alice rather
unwillingly took the place of the March Hare.  The Hatter was the
only one who got any advantage from the change:  and Alice was a
good deal worse off than before, as the March Hare had just upset
the milkjug into his plate.

  Alice did not wish to offend the Dormouse again, so she began
very cautiously:  But I dont understand.  Where did they draw
the treacle from?

  You can draw water out of a waterwell, said the Hatter so
I should think you could draw treacle out of a treaclewelleh,
stupid?
