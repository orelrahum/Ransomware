Plagues:  They, astonished, all resistance lost,
All courage down their idle weapons dropt:
Oer shields, and helms, and helmed heads he rode
Of Thrones and mighty Seraphim prostrate,
That wished the mountains now might be again
Thrown on them, as a shelter from his ire.
Nor less on either side tempestuous fell
His arrows, from the fourfoldvisaged Four
Distinct with eyes, and from the living wheels
Distinct alike with multitude of eyes
One Spirit in them ruled and every eye
Glared lightning, and shot forth pernicious fire
Among the accursed, that withered all their strength,
And of their wonted vigour left them drained,
Exhausted, spiritless, afflicted, fallen.
Yet half his strength he put not forth, but checked
His thunder in mid volley for he meant
Not to destroy, but root them oFG LU SVZEVM:
