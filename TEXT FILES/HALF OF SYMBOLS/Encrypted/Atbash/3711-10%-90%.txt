Immutable, Immortal, Infinite,
Eternal King the Author of all being,
Fonntain of light, thyself invisible
Amidst the glorious brightness where thou sitst
Throned inaccessible, but when thou shadest
The full blaze of thy beams, and, through a cloud
Drawn round about thee like a radiant shrine,
Dark with excessive bright thy skirts appear,
Yet dazzle Heaven, that brightest Seraphim
Approach not, but with both wings veil their eBVH.
