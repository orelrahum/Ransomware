ROSALIND	O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
	didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
	it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
	bottom, like the bay of Portugal.

CELIA	Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
	affection in, it runs out.

ROSALIND	No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
	of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
	that blind rascally boy that abuses every ones eyes
	because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
	am in love. Ill tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
	of the sight of Orlando: Ill go find a shadow and
	sigh till he come.

CELIA	And Ill sleep.

	Exeunt




	AS YOU LIKE IT

JAQUES	Which is he that killed the deer?

A Lord	Sir, it was I.

JAQUES	Lets present him to the duke, like a Roman
	conqueror and it would do well to set the deers
	horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
	you no song, forester, for this purpose?

Forester	Yes, sir.

JAQUES	Sing it: tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
	make noise enough.

	SONG.
Forester	What shall he have that killd the deer?
	His leather skin and horns to wear.
	Then sing him home
