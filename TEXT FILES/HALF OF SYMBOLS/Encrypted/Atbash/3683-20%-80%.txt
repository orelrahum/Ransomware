Forbore: then these to her Satan returned:
  "So strange thy outcry, and thy words so strange
Thou interposest, that my sudden hand,
Prevented, spares to tell thee yet by deeds
What it intends, till first I know of thee
What thing thou art, thus doubleformed, and why,
In this infernal vale first met, thou callst
Me father, and that phantasm callst my son.
I know thee not, nor ever saw till now
Sight more detestable than him and thee."
  T whom thus the Portress of Hellgate replied:
"Hast thou forgot me, then and do I seem
Now in thine eye so foul?once deemed so fair
In Heaven, when at th assembly, and in sight
Of all the Seraphim with thee combined
In bold conspiracy against Heavens King,
All on a sudden miserable pain
Surprised thee, dim thine eyes and dizzy swum
In darkness, while thy head flames thick and fast
Threw forth, till on the left side opening wide,
Likest to thee in shape and countenance bright,
Then shining heavenly fair, a goddess armed,
Out of thy head I sprung. Amazement seized
All th host of Heaven back they recoilVW ZUIZRW
