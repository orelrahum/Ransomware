  There was a general clapping of hands at this:  it was the
first really clever thing the King had said that day.

  That PROVES his guilt, said the Queen.

  It proves nothing of the sort! said Alice.  Why, you dont
even know what theyre about!

  Read them, said the King.

  The White Rabbit put on his spectacles.  Where shall I begin,
please your Majesty? he asked.

  Begin at the beginning, the King said gravely, and go on
till you come to the end:  then stop.

  These were the verses the White Rabbit read:

        They told me you had been to her,
          And mentioned me to him:
        She gave me a good character,
          But said I could not swim.

        He sent them word I had not gone
          We know it to be true:
        If she should push the matter on,
          What would become of you?

        I gave her one, they gave him two,
          You gave us three or more
        They all returned from him to you,
          Though they were mine before.

        If I or she should chance to be
          Involved in this affair,
        He trusts to you to set them free,
          Exactly as we were.

        My notion was that you had been
          Before she had this fit
        An obstacle that came between
          Him, and ourselves, and it.

        Dont let him know she liked them best,
          For this must ever be
        A secret, kept from all the rest,
          Between youIHVOU ZMW NV.
