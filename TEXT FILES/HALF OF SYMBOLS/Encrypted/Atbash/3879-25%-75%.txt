Their snaky folds, and added wings.  First crept
The parsimonious emmet, provident
Of future in small room large heart enclosed
Pattern of just equality perhaps
Hereafter, joined in her popular tribes
Of commonalty:  Swarming next appeared
The female bee, that feeds her husband drone
Deliciously, and builds her waxen cells
With honey stored:  The rest are numberless,
And thou their natures knowest, and gavest them names,
Needless to thee repeated nor unknown
The serpent, subtlest beast of all the field,
Of huge extent sometimes, with brazen eyes
And hairy mane terrifick, though to thee
Not noxious, but obedient at thy call.
Now Heaven in all her glory shone, and rolled
Her motions, as the great first Movers hand
First wheeled their course:  Earth in her rich attire
Consummate lovely smiled air, water, earth,
By fowl, fish, beast, was flown, was swum, was walked,
