After detailing the two primary ways to gain access to the journal,
through the OCLC network and Compuserv if one desires graphics or through
the Internet if just an ASCII file is desired, LEBRON illustrated the
speedy editorial process and the coding of the document using SGML tags
after it has been accepted for publication.  She also gave an illustrated
tour of the journal, its searchandretrieval capabilities in particular,
but also including problems associated with scanning in illustrations,
and the importance of onscreen alerts to the medical profession re
retractions or corrections, or more frequently, editorials, letters to
the editors, or followup reports.  She closed by inviting the audience
to join AAAS on 1 July, when OJCCT was scheduled to go online.

                                 


DISCUSSION  Additional features of OJCCT 


In the lengthy discussion that followed LEBRONs presentation, these
points emerged:

      The SGML text can be tailored as users wish.

      All these articles have a fairly simple document definition.

      Documenttype definitions DTDs were developed and given to OJCCT
     for coding.

      No articles will be removed from the journal.  Because there are
     no back issues, there are no lost issues either.  Once a subscriber
     logs onto the journal he or she has access not only to the currently
     published materials, but retrospectively to everything that has been
     published in it.  Thus the table of contents grows bigger.  The date
     of publication serves to distinguish between currently published
     materials and older materials.

      The pricing system for the journal resembles that for most medical
     journals:  for 1992, 95 for a year, plus telecommunications charges
     there are no connect time charges    for 1993, 110 for the
     entire year for single users, though the journal can be put on a
     local area network LAN.  However, only one person can access the
     journal at a time.  Site licenses may come in the future.

      AAAS is working closely with colleagues at OCLC to display
     mathematical equations on screen.

      Without compromising any steps in the editorial process, the
     technology has reduced the time lag between when a manuscript is
     originally submitted and the time it is accepted the review process
     does not differ greatly from the standard sixtoeight weeks
     employed by many of the hardcopy journals.  GSV KILXVHH HGROO
