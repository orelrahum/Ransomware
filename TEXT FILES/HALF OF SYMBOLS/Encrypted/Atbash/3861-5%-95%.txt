And longer will delay to hear thee tell
His generation, and the rising birth
Of Nature from the unapparent Deep:
Or if the star of evening and the moon
Haste to thy audience, Night with her will bring,
Silence and Sleep, listening to thee, will watch
Or we can bid his absence, till thy song
End, and dismiss thee ere the morning shine.
Thus Adam his illustrious guest besought:
And thus the Godlike Angel answered mild.
This also thy request, with caution asked,
Obtain though to recount almighty works
What words or tongue of Seraph can suffice,
Or heart of man suffice to comprehend?
Yet what thou canst attain, which best may serve
To glorify the Maker, and infer
Thee also happier, shall not be withheld
Thy hearing such commission from above
I have received, to answer thy desire
Of knowledge within bounds beyond, abstain
To ask nor let thine own inventions hope
Things not revealed, which the invisible King,
Only Omniscient, hath suppressed in night
To none communicable in Earth or Heaven:
Enough is left besides to search and know.
But knowledge is as food, ZMW MVVWH ML OVHH
