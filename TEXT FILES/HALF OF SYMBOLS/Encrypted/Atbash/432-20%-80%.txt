:Uganda Economy

Overview:
    Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular
    rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. The economy has
    been devastated by widespread political instability, mismanagement, and
    civil war since independence in 1962, keeping Uganda poor with a per capita
    income of about 300. GDP remains below the levels of the early 1970s, as
    does industriaO KILWFXGRLM. ZTIRXFOGFIV RH GSV NLHG RNKLIGZMG HVXGLI LU GSV
