          I beat him when he sneezes
        For he can thoroughly enjoy
          The pepper when he pleases!

                    CHORUS.

                Wow! wow! wow!

  Here! you may nurse it a bit, if you like! the Duchess said
to Alice, flinging the baby at her as she spoke.  I must go and
get ready to play croquet with the Queen, and she hurried out of
the room.  The cook threw a fryingpan after her as she went out,
but it just missed her.

  Alice caught the baby with some difficulty, as it was a queer
shaped little creature, and held out its arms and legs in all
directions, just like a starfish, thought Alice.  The poor
little thing was snorting like a steamengine when she caught it,
and kept doubling itself up and straightening itself out again,
so that altogether, for the first minute or two, it was as much
as she could do to hold it.

  As soon as she had made out the proper way of nursing it,
which was to twist it up into a sort of knot, and then keep
tight hold of its right ear and left foot, so as to prevent its
undoing itself, she carried it out into the open air.  IF I
dont take this child away with me, thought Alice, theyre sure
to kill it in a day or two:  wouldnt it be murder to leave it
behind?  She said the last words out loud, and the little thing
grunted in reply it had left off sneezing by this time.  Dont
grunt, said Alice thats not at all a proper way of expressing
yourself.

  The baby grunted again, and AORXV OLLPVW EVIB ZMCRLFHOB RMGL
