:Thailand Economy

Overview:
    Thailand, one of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, enjoyed a
    year of 8 growth in 1991, although down from an annual average of 11
    growth between 1987 and 1990. The increasingly sophisticated manufacturing
    sector benefited from exportoriented investment. The manufacturing and
    service sectors have accounted for the lions share of economic growth.
    Thailands traditional agricultural sector continued to become less
    important to the overall economy in 1991. The trade deficit continued to
    increase in 1991, to 11 billion earnings from tourism and remittances grew
    marginally as a result of the Gulf War and Thailands import bill grew,
    especially for manufactures and oil. The government has followed fairly
    sound fiscal and monetary policies. Aided by increased tax receipts from the
    fastmoving economy Bangkok recorded its fourth consecutive budget surplus
    in 1991. The government is moving ahead with new projects  especially for
    telecommunications, roads, and port facilities  needed to refurbish the
    countrys overtaxed infrastructure. Political unrest and the militarys
    shooting of antigovernment demonstrators in May 1992 have caused
    international businessmen to question Thailands political stability.
    Thailands general economic outlook remains good, however, assuming the
    continuation of the governments progrowth measures.
