:Antigua and Barbuda Economy

Overview:
    The economy is primarily service oriented, with tourism the most important
    determinant of economic performance. During the period 198790, real GDP
    expanded at an annual average rate of about 6. Tourism makes a direct
    contribution to GDP of about 13 and also affects growth in other sectors 
    particularly in construction, communications, and public utilities. Although
    Antigua and Barbuda is one of the few areas in the Caribbean experiencing a
    labor shortage in some sectors of the economy, it was hurt in 1991 by a
    downturn in tourism caused by the Persian Gulf war and the US recession.
