To supplication hear his sighs, though mute
Unskilful with what words to pray, let me
Interpret for him me, his advocate
And propitiation all his works on me,
Good, or not good, ingraft my merit those
Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.
Accept me and, in me, from these receive
The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live
Before thee reconciled, at least his days
Numbered, though sad till death, his doom, which I
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,
To better life shall yield him: where with me
All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss
Made one with me, as I with thee am one.
To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.
All thy request for Man, accepteW HLM,
