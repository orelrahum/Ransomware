TOUCHSTONE	Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
	swear by your beards that I am a knave.

CELIA	By our beards, if we had them, thou art.

TOUCHSTONE	By my knavery, if I had it, then I were but if you
	swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
	more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
	never had any or if he had, he had sworn it away
	before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
