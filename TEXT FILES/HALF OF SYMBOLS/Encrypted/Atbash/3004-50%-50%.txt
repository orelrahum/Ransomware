carefully, nibbling first at one and then at the other, and
growing sometimes taller and sometimes shorter, until she had
succeeded in bringing herself down to her usual height.

  It was so long since she had been anything near the right size,
that it felt quite strange at first but she got used to it in a
few minutes, and began talking to herself, as usual.  Come,
theres half my plan done now!  How puzzling all these changes
are!  Im never sure what Im going to be, from one minute to
another!  However, Ive got back to my right size:  the next
thing is, to get into that beautiful gardenhow IS that to be
done, I wonder?  As she said this, she came suddenly upon an
open place, with a little house in it about four feet high.
