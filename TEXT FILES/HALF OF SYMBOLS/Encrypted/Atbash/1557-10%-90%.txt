it, busily painting them red.  Alice thought this a very curious
thing, and she went nearer to watch them, and just as she came up
to them she heard one of them say, Look out now, Five!  Dont go
splashing paint over me like that!

  I couldnt help it, said Five, in a sulky tone Seven jogged
my elbow.

  On which Seven looked up and said, Thats right, Five!  Always
lay the blame on others!

  YOUD better not talk! said Five.  I heard the Queen say only
yesterday you deserved to be beheaded!

  What for? said the one who had spoken first.

  Thats none of YOUR business, Two! said Seven.

  Yes, it IS his business! said Five, and Ill tell himit
was for bringing the cook tuliproots instead of onions.

  Seven flung down his brush, and had just begun Well, of all
the unjust things when his eye chanced to fall upon Alice, as
she stood watching them, and he checked himself suddenly:  the
others looked round also, and all of them bowed low.

  Would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, why you are
painting those roses?

  Five and Seven said nothing, but looked at Two.  Two began in a
low voice, Why the fact is, you see, Miss, this here ought to

and the three gardeners instantly threw themselves flat upon
their faces.  There was a sound of many footsteps, and Alice
looked round, eager to see the Queen.

  First came ten soldiers carrying clubs these were all shaped
like the three gardeners, oblong and flat, with their hands and
feet at the corners:  next the ten courtiers these were
ornamented all over with diamonds, and walked two and two, as the
soldiers did.  After these came the royal children there were
ten of them, and the little dears came jumping merrily along hand
in hand, in couples:  they were all ornamented with hearts.  Next
came the guests, mostly Kings and Queens, and among them Alice
recognised the White Rabbit:  it was talking in a hurried nervous
manner, smiling at everything that was said, and went by without
noticing her.  Then followed the Knave of Hearts, carrying the
Kings crown on a crimson velvet cushion and, last of all this
grand procession, came THE KING AND QUEEN OF HEARTS.

her face like the three gardeners, but she could not remember
