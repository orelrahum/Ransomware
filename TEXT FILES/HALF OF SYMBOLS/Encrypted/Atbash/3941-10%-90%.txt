To such disport before her through the field,
From every beast more duteous at her call,
Than at Circean call the herd disguised.

But as in gaze admiring: oft he bowed
His turret crest, and sleek enamelled neck,
Fawning and licked the ground whereon she trod.

Thy awful brow, more awful thus retired.

By gift, and thy celestial beauty adore
With ravishment beheld! there best beheld,
