So since into his church lewd hirelings climb.
Thence up he flew, and on the tree of life,
The middle tree and highest there that grew,
Sat like a cormorant yet not true life
Thereby regained, but sat devising death
To them who lived nor on the virtue thought
Of that lifegiving plant, but only used
For prospect, what well used had been the pledge
Of immortality.  So little knows
Any, but God alone, to value right
The good before him, but perverts best things
To worst abuse, or to their meanest use.
Beneath him with new wonder now he views,
To all delight of human sense exposed,
In narrow room, Natures whole wealth, yea more,
A Heaven on Earth:  For blissful Paradise
Of God the garden was, by hiN RM GSV VZHG
