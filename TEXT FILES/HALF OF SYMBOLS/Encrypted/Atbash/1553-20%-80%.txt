you what year it is?

  Of course not, Alice replied very readily:  but thats
because it stays the same year for such a long time together.

  Which is just the case with MINE, said the Hatter.

  Alice felt dreadfully puzzled.  The Hatters remark seemed to
have no sort of meaning in it, and yet it was certainly English.
I dont quite understand you, she said, as politely as she
could.

  The Dormouse is asleep again, said the Hatter, and he poured
a little hot tea upon its nose.

  The Dormouse shook its head impatiently, and said, without
opening its eyes, Of course, of course just what I was going to
remark myself.

  Have you guessed the riddle yet? the Hatter said, turning to
Alice again.

  No, I give it up, Alice replied:  whats the answer?

  I havent the slightest idea, said the Hatter.

  Nor I, said the March Hare.

  Alice sighed wearily.  I think you might do something better
with the time, she said, than waste it in asking riddles that
have no answers.

  If you knew Time as well as I do, said the Hatter, you
wouldnt talk about wasting IT.  Its HIM.

  I dont know what you mean, said Alice.

  Of course you dont! the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously.  I dare say you never even spoke to Time!

  Perhaps not, Alice cautiously replied:  but I know I have to
beat time when I learn music.

  Ah! that accounts for it, said the Hatter.  He wont stand
beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, hed do
almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose
it were nine oclock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:
youd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
clock in a twinkling!  Halfpast one, time for dinner!

  I only wish it was, the March Hare said to itself in a
whisper.

  That would be grand, certainly, said AlicV GSLFTSGUFOOB:
