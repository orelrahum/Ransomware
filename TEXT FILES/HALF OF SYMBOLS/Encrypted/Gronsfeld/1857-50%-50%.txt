This earth? reciprocal, if land be there,
Fields and inhabitants:  Her spots thou seest
As clouds, and clouds may rain, and rain produce
Fruits in her softened soil for some to eat
Allotted there and other suns perhaps,
With their attendant moons, thou wilt descry,
Communicating male and female light
Which two great sexes animate the world,
Stored in each orb perhaps with some that live.
For such vast room in Nature unpossessed
By living soul, desart and desolate,
Only to shine, yet scarce to contribute
Each orb a glimpse of light, conveyed so far
Down to this habitable, which returns
Light back to them, is obvious to dispute.
But whether thus these things, or whether not
But whether the sun, predominant in Heaven,
Rise on the earth or earth rise on the sun
He from the east his flaming road begin
Or she from west her silent course advance,
With inoffensive pace that spinning sleeps
On her soft axle, while she paces even,
And bears thee soft with the smooth hair along
Sollicit not thy thoughts with matters hid
Leave them to God above him serve, and fear!
Of other creatures, as him pleases best,
Wherever placed, let him dispose joy thou
In what he gives to thee, this Paradise
And thy fair Eve Heaven is for thee too high
To know what passes there be lowly wise:
Think only what concerns thee, and thy being
Dream not of other worlds, what creatures tQMVH
