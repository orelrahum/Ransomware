suppressed by the officers of the court.  As that is rather a
hard word, I will just explain to you how it was done.  They had
a large canvas bag, which tied up at the mouth with strings:
into this they slipped the guineapig, head first, and then sat
upon it.

  Im glad Ive seen that done, thought Alice.  Ive so often
read in the newspapers, at the end of trials, "There was some
attempts at applause, which was immediately suppressed by the
officers of the court," and I never understood what it meant
till now.

  If thats all you know about it, you may stand down,
continued the King.

  I cant go no lower, said the Hatter:  Im on the floor, as
it is.

  Then you may SIT down, the King replied.

  Here the other guineapig cheered, and was suppressed.

  Come, that finished the guineapigs! thought Alice.  Now we
shall get on better.

  Id rather finish my tea, said the Hatter, with an anxious
look at the Queen, who was reading the list of singers.

  You may go, said the King, and the Hatter hurriedly left the
court, without even waiting to put his shoes on.

  and just take his head off outside, the Queen added to one
of the officers:  but the Hatter was out of sight before the
officer could get to the door.

  Call the next witness! said the King.

  The next witness was the Duchesss cook.  She carried the
pepperbox in her hand, and Alice guessed who it was, even before
she got into the court, by the way the people near the door began
sneezing all at once.

  Give your evidence, said the King.

  Shant, said the cook.

  The King looked anxiously at the White Rabbit, who said in a
low voice, Your Majesty must crossexamine THIS witness.

  Well, if I must, I must, the King said, with a melancholy
air, and, after folding his arms and frowning at the cook till
his eyes were nearly out of sight, he said in a deep voice, What
are tarts made of?

  Pepper, mostly, said the cook.

  Treacle, said a sleepy voice behind her.

  Collar that Dormouse, the Queen shrieked out.  Behead that
Dormouse!  Turn that Dormouse out of court!  Suppress him!  Pinch
him!  Off with his whiskers!

  For some minutes the whole court was in confusion, getting the
Dormouse turned out, and, by the time they had settled down
again, the cook had disappeared.

  Never mind! said the King, with an air of great relief.
Call the next witness.  And he added in an undertone to the
Queen, Really, my dear, YOU must crossexamine the next witness.
It quite makes my forehead ache!

  Alice watched the White Rabbit as he fumbled over the list,
feeling very curious to see what the next witness would be like,
for they havent got much evidence YET, she said to herself.
Imagine her surprise, when the White Rabbit read out, at the top
of his shrill little voice, the name Alice!



                           CHAPTER XII

                        Alices Evidence


  Here! cried Alice, quite forgetting in the flurry of the
moment how large she had grown in the last few minutes, and she
jumped up in such a hurry that she tipped over the jurybox with
the edge of her skirt, upsetting all the jurymen on to the heads
of the crowd below, and there they lay sprawling about, reminding
her very much of a globe of goldfish she had accidentally upset
the week before.

  Oh, I BEG your pardon! she exclaimed in a tone of great
dismay, and began picking them up again as quickly as she could,
for the accident of the goldfish kept running in her head, and
she had a vague sort of idea that they must be collected at once
and put back into the jurybox, or they would die.

  The trial cannot proceed, said the King in a very grave
voice, until all the jurymen are back in their proper places
ALL, he repeated with great emphasis, looking hard at Alice as
he said do.

  Alice looked at the jurybox, and saw that, in her haste, she
had put the Lizard in head downwards, and the poor little thing
was waving its tail about in a melancholy way, being quite unable
to move.  She soon got it out again, and put it right not that
it signifies much, she said to herself I should think it
would be QUITE as much use in the trial one way up as the other.

  As soon as the jury had a little recovered from the shock of
being upset, and their slates and pencils had been found and
handed back to them, theG UEC BS ZTVR EMWG FIUQKHSXSH BT ETICM
