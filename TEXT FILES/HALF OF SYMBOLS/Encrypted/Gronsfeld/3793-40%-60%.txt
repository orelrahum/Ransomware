What order, so contrived as not to mix
Tastes, not well joined, inelegant, but bring
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change
Bestirs her then, and from each tender stalk
Whatever Earth, allbearing mother, yields
In India East or West, or middle shore
In Pontus or the Punick coast, or where

She gathers, tribute large, and on the board
Heaps with unsparing hand for drink the grape

From many a berry, and from sweet kernels pressed
She tempers dulcet creams nor these to hold
Wants her fit vessels pure then strows the ground
With rose and odours from the shrub unfumed.

His Godlike guest, walks forth, without more train
Accompanied than with his own complete
Perfections in himself was alO MMZ BBFBG,
