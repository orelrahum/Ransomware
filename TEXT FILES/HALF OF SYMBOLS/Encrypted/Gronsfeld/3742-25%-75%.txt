A whole days journey high, but wide remote
From this Assyrian garden, where the Fiend
Saw, undelighted, all delight, all kind
Of living creatures, new to sight, and strange
Two of far nobler shape, erect and tall,
Godlike erect, with native honour clad
In naked majesty seemed lords of all:
And worthy seemed for in their looks divine
The image of their glorious Maker shone,
Truth, wisdom, sanctitude severe EUM XZZG,
