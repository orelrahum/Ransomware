wouldnt talk about wasting IT.  Its HIM.

  I dont know what you mean, said Alice.

  Of course you dont! the Hatter said, tossing his head
contemptuously.  I dare say you never even spoke to Time!

  Perhaps not, Alice cautiously replied:  but I know I have to
beat time when I learn music.

  Ah! that accounts for it, said the Hatter.  He wont stand
beating.  Now, if you only kept on good terms with him, hed do
almost anything you liked with the clock.  For instance, suppose
it were nine oclock in the morning, just time to begin lessons:
youd only have to whisper a hint to Time, and round goes the
clock in a twinkling!  Halfpast one, time for dinner!

  I only wish it was, the March Hare said to itself in a
whisper.

  That would be grand, certainly, said Alice thoughtfully:
but thenI shouldnt be hungry for it, you know.

  Not at first, perhaps, said the Hatter:  but you could keep
it to halfpast one as long as you liked.

  Is that the way YOU manage? Alice asked.

  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  Not I! he replied.
We quarrelled last Marchjust before HE went mad, you know
pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare, it was at the
great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing
