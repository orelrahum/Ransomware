And from about her shot darts of desire
Into all eyes, to wish her still in sight.
And Raphael now, to Adams doubt proposed,
Benevolent and facile thus replied.
To ask or search, I blame thee not for Heaven
Is as the book of God before thee set,
Wherein to read his wonderous works, and learn
His seasons, hours, or days, or months, or years:
This to attain, whether Heaven move or Earth,
Imports not, if thou reckon right the rest
From Man or Angel the great Architect
Did wisely to conceal, and not divulge
His secrets to be scanned by them who ought
Rather admire or, if they list to try
Conjecture, he his fabrick of the Heavens
Hath left to their disputes, perhaps to move
His laughter at their quaint opinions wide
Hereafter when they come to model Heaven
And calculate the stars, how they will wield
The mighty frame how build, unbuild, contrive
To save appearances how gird the sphere
With centrick and eccentrick scribbled oer,
Cycle and epicycle, orb in orb:
Already by thy reasoning this I guess,
Who art to lead thy offspring, and supposest
That bodies bright and greater should not serve
The less not bright, nor Heaven such journeys run,
Earth sitting still, when she alone receives
The benefit:  Consider first, that great
Or bright infers not excellence: the Earth
Though, in comparison of Heaven, so small,
Nor glistering, may of solid good contain
More plenty than the sun that barren shines
Whose virtue on itself works no effect,
But in the fruitful Earth there first received,
His beams, unactive else, their vigour find.
Yet not to Earth are those bright luminaries
Officious but to thee, Earths habitant.
And for the Heavens wide circuit, let it speak
The Makers high magnificence, who built
So spacious, and his line stretched out so far
That Man may know he dwells not in his own
An edifice too large for him to fill,
Lodged in a small partition and the rest
Ordained for uses to his Lord best known.
The swiftness of those circles attribute,
Though numberless, to his Omnipotence,
That to corporeal substances could add
Speed almost spiritual:  Me thou thinkest not slow,
Who since the morninghour set out from Heaven
Where God resides, and ere midday arrived
In Eden distance inexpressible
By numbers that have name.  But this I urge,
Admitting motion in the Heavens, to BPTE
