:Indian Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Indian Ocean provides a major highway for the movement of petroleum
    products from the Middle East to Europe and North and South American
    countries. Fish from the ocean are of growing economic importance to many of
    the bordering countries as a source of both food and exports. Fishing fleets
    from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly
    for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves of hydrocarbons are being tapped in the
    offshore areas of Saudi Arabia, Iran, India, and Western Australia. An
    estimated 40 of the worlds offshore oil production comes from the Indian
    Ocean. Beach sands rich in heavy minerals and offshore placer deposits are
    actively exploited by bordering countries, particularly India, South Africa,
    Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Industries:
    based on exploitation of natural resources, particularly marine life,
    minerals, oil and gas production, fishing, sand and gravel aggregates,
    placer deposits
