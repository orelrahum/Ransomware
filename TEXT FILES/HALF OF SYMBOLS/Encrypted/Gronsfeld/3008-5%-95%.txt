  Please would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, for
she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to
speak first, why your cat grins like that?

  Its a Cheshire cat, said the Duchess, and thats why.
Pig!

  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice
quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed
to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on
again:

  I didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact, I
didnt know that cats COULD grin.

  They all can, said the Duchess and most of em do.

  I dont know of any that do, Alice said very politely,
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.

  You dont know much, said the Duchess and thats a fact.

  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of
conversation.  WhiSN AMM YAB BVBNRN CW KQZ OW WRH, YLL LWTS VOXS
