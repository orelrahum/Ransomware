Thee also from obedience, that, with him
Bereaved of happiness, thou mayest partake
His punishment, eternal misery
Which would be all his solace and revenge,
As a despite done against the Most High,
Thee once to gain companion of his woe.
But listen not to his temptations, warn
Thy weaker let it profit thee to have heard,
By terrible example, the reward
Of disobedience firm they might have stood,
Yet fell remember, and fear to transgress.



Book VII


Descend from Heaven, Urania, by that name
If rightly thou art called, whose voice divine
Following, above the Olympian hill I soar,
Above the flight of Pegasean wing!
The meaning, not the name, I call: for thou
Nor of the Muses nine, nor on the top
Of old Olympus dwellest but, heavenlyborn,
Before the hills appeared, or fountain flowed,
Thou ENBJ ECMVQFP DRAIWO DRLWW HSUEMWAG,
