:Guadeloupe Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services.
    It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. Tourism is
    a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly
    large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important
    sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas
    which now supply about 50 of export earnings, eggplant, and flowers.
    Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption,
    although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly
    from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production.
    Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
    high among the young.
