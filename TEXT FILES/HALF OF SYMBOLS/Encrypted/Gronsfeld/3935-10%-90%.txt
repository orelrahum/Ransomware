Lest, by some fairappearing good surprised,
She dictate false and misinform the will
To do what God expressly hath forbid.
Not then mistrust, but tender love, enjoins,
That I should mind thee oft and mind thou me.
Firm we subsist, yet possible to swerve
Since Reason not impossibly may meet
Some specious object by the foe suborned,
And fall into deception unaware,
Not keeping strictest watch, as she was warned.
Seek not temptation then, which to avoid
Were better, and most likely if from me
Thou sever not: Trial will come unsought.
Wouldst thou approve thy constancy, approve
First thy obedience the other who can know,
Not seeing thee attempted, who attest?
But, if thou think, trial unsought may find
Us both securer than thus warned thou seemest,
Go for thy stay, not free, absents thee more
Go in thy native innocence, rely
On what thou hast of virtue summon all!
For God towards thee hath done his part, do thine.
So spake the patriarch of mJVOLSH IDB JDG
