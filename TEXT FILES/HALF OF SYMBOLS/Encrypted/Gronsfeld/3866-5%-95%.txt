He took the golden compasses, prepared
In Gods eternal store, to circumscribe
This universe, and all created things:
One foot he centered, and the other turned
Round through the vast profundity obscure
And said, Thus far extend, thus far thy bounds,
This be thy just circumference, O World!
Thus God the Heaven created, thus the Earth,
Matter unformed and void:  Darkness profound
Covered the abyss: but on the watery calm
His brooding wings the Spirit of God outspread,
And vital virtue infused, and vital warmth
Throughout the fluid mass but downward purged
The black tartareous cold infernal dregs,
Adverse to life: then founded, then conglobed
Like things to like the rest to several place
Disparted, and between spun out the air
And Earth selfbalanced on her center hung.
Let there be light, said God and forthwith Light
Ethereal, first of things, quintessence pure,
Sprung from the deep and from her native east
To journey through the aery gloom began,
Sphered in a radiant cloud, for yet the sun
Was not she in a cloudy tabernacle
Sojourned the while.  God saw the QMNQB BIU GXWH
