To mortal combat, or career with lance,
Thick swarmed, both on the ground and in the air,
Brushed with the hiss of rustling wings. As bees
In springtime, when the Sun with Taurus rides.
Pour forth their populous youth about the hive
In clusters they among fresh dews and flowers
Fly to and fro, or on the smoothed plank,
The suburb of their strawbuilt citadel,
New rubbed with balm, expatiate, and confer
Their stateaffairs: so thick the airy crowd
Swarmed and were straitened till, the signal given,
Behold a wonder! They but now who seemed
In bigness to surpass Earths giant sons,
Now less than smallest dwarfs, in narrow room
Throng numberlesslike that pygmean race
Beyond the Indian mount or faery elves,
Whose midnight revels, by a forestside
Or fountain, some belated peasant sees,
Or dreams he sees, while overhead the Moon
Sits arbitress, and nearer to the Earth
Wheels her pale course: they, on their mirth and dance
Intent, with jocund music charm his ear
At once with joy and fear his heart rebounds.
