Out of his grave, fresh as the dawning light,
Thy ransom paid, which Man from death redeems,
His death for Man, as many as offered life
Neglect not, and the benefit embrace
By faith not void of works:  This Godlike act
Annuls thy doom, the death thou shouldest have died,
In sin for ever lost from life this act
Shall bruise the head of Satan, crush his strength,
Defeating Sin and Death, his two main arms
And fix far deeper in his head their stings
Than temporal death shall bruise the victors heel,
Or theirs whom he redeems a death, like sleep,
A gentle wafting to immortal life.
