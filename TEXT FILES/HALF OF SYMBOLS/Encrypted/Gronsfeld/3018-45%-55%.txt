  There was a table set out under a tree in front of the house,
and the March Hare and the Hatter were having tea at it:  a
Dormouse was sitting between them, fast asleep, and the other two
were using it as a cushion, resting their elbows on it, and the
talking over its head.  Very uncomfortable for the Dormouse,
thought Alice only, as its asleep, I suppose it doesnt mind.

  The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded
together at one corner of it:  VS UTST!  WW WWQM! CPIB HVPNL
