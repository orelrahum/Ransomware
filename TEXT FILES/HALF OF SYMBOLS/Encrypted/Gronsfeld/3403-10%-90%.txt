transmission rates particularly, the time it takes to move various forms
of information, and what one could do with a network supporting
multigigabitpersecond transmission.  At the moment, the network
environment includes a composite of datatransmission requirements,
volumes and forms, going from steady to bursty highvolume and from
very slow to very fast.  This aggregate must be considered in the design,
construction, and operation of multigigabyte networks.

LARSENs objective is to use the networks and library systems now being
constructed to increase access to resources wherever they exist, JVI
