I have in view, calling to mind with heed
Part of our sentence, that thy seed shall bruise
The Serpents head piteous amends! unless
Be meant, whom I conjecture, our grand foe,
Satan who, in the serpent, hath contrived
Against us this deceit:  To crush his head
Would be revenge indeed! which will be lost
By death brought on ourselves, or childless days
Resolved, as thou proposest so our foe
Shal scape his punishment ordained, and we
Instead shall double ours upon our heads.
