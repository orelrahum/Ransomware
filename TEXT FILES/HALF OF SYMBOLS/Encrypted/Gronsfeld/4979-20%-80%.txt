:Ghana Economy

Overview:
    Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been
    implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including
    moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily
    dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not

    undercutting structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in
    1990. Much of the economiL QRXTOEMQHSX PW 1991 EFA EADAIG GC MJDTZCBUM
