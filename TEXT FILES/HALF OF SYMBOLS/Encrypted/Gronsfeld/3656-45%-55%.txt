On this side nothing and by proof we feel
Our power sufficient to disturb his Heaven,
And with perpetual inroads to alarm,
Though inaccessible, his fatal throne:
Which, if not victory, is yet revenge."
  He ended frowning, and his look denounced
Desperate revenge, and battle dangerous
To less than gods. On th other side up rose
Belial, in act more graceful and humane.
A fairer person lost not Heaven he seemed
For dignity composed, and high exploit.
But all was false and hollow though his tongue
Dropped manna, and could make the worse appear
