Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
Yielded them, sidelong as they sat recline
On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers:
The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind,
Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream

Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems

Dandled the kid bears, tigerA, SXSGLB, XFZFS,
