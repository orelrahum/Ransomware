"William the Conqueror, whose cause was favoured by the pope, was
soon submitted to by the English, who wanted leaders, and had been
of late much accustomed to usurpation and conquest.  Edwin and
Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria"

  Ugh! said the Lory, with a shiver.

  I beg your pardon! said the Mouse, frowning, but very
politely:  Did you speak?

  Not I! said the Lory hastily.

  I thought you did, said the Mouse.  I proceed.  "Edwin and
Morcar, the earls of Mercia and Northumbria, declared for him:
and even Stigand, the patriotic archbishop of Canterbury, found
it advisable"

  Found WHAT? said the Duck.

  Found IT, the Mouse replied rather crossly:  of course you
know what "it" means.

  I know what "it" means well enough, when I find a thing, said
the Duck:  its generally a frog or a worm.  The question is,
what did the archbishop find?

  The Mouse did not notice this question, but hurriedly went on,
"found it advisable to go with Edgar Atheling to meet William
and offer him the crown.  Williams conduct at first was
moderate.  But the insolence of his Normans"  How are you
getting on now, my dear? it continued, turning to Alice as it
spoke.

  As wet as ever, said Alice in a melancholy tone:  it doesnt
seem to dry me at all.

  In that case, said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, I
move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies

  Speak English! said the Eaglet.  I dont know the meaning of
half those long words, and, whats more, I dont believe you do
either!  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:
some of the other birds tittered audibly.

  What I was going to say, said the Dodo in an offended tone,
was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucusrace.

  What IS a Caucusrace? said Alice not that she wanted much
to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

  Why, said the Dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it.
And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter
day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.

  First it marked out a racecourse, in a sort of circle, the
exact shape doesnt matter, it said, and then all the party
were placed along the course, here and there.  There was no One,
two, three, and away, but they began running when they liked,
and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know
when the race was over.  However, when they had been running half
an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called
out The race is over! and they all crowded round it, panting,
and asking, But who has won?

  This question the Dodo could not answer without a great deal of
thought, and it sat for a long time with one finger pressed upon
its forehead the position in which you usually see Shakespeare,
in the pictures of him, while the rest waited in silence.  At
last the Dodo said, EVERYBODY has won, and all must have
prizes.

  But who is to give the prizes? quite a chorus of voices
asked.

  Why, SHE, of course, said the Dodo, pointing to Alice with
one finger and the whole party at once crowded round her,
calling out in a confused way, Prizes! Prizes!

  Alice had no idea what to do, and in despair she put her hand
in her pocket, and pulled out a box of comfits, luckily the salt
water had not got into it, and handed them round as prizes.
There was exactly one apiece all round.

  But she must have a prize herself, you know, said the Mouse.

  Of course, the Dodo replied very gravely.  What else have
you got in your pocket? he went on, turning to Alice.

  Only a thimble, said Alice sadly.

  Hand it over here, said the Dodo.

  Then they all crowded round her once more, while the Dodo
solemnly presented the thimble, saying We beg your acceptance of
this elegant thimble and, when it had finished this short
speech, they all cheered.

  Alice thought the whole thing very absurd, but they all looked
so grave that she did not dare to laugh and, as she could not
think of anything to say, she simply bowed, and took the thimble,
looking as solemn as she could.

  The next thing was to eat the comfits:  this caused some noise
and confusion, as the large birds complained that they could not
taste theirs, and the small ones choked and had to be patted on
the back.  However, it was over at last, and they sat down again
in a ring, and begged the Mouse to tell them something more.

  You promised to tell me your history, you know, said Alice,
and why it is you hateC and D, she added in a whisper, half
afraid that it would be offended again.

  Mine is a long and a sad tale! said the Mouse, turning to
Alice, and sighing.

  It IS a long tail, certainly, said Alice, looking down with
wonder at the Mouses tail but why do you call it sad?  And
she kept on puzzling about it while the Mouse was speaking, so
that her idea of the tale was something like this:

                    Fury said to a
                   mouse, That he
                 met in the
               house,
            "Let us
              both go to
                law:  I will
                  prosecute
                    YOU.  Come,
                       Ill take no
                        denial We
                     must have a
                 trial:  For
              really this
           morning Ive
          nothing
         to do."
           Said the
             mouse to the
               cur, "Such
                 a trial,
                   dear Sir,
                         With
                     no jury
                  or judge,
                would be
              wasting
             our
              breath."
               "Ill be
                 judge, Ill
                   be jury,"
                         Said
                    cunning
                      old Fury:
                     "Ill
                      try the
                         whole
                          cause,
                             and
                        condemn
                       you
                      to
                       death."


  You are not attending! said the Mouse to Alice severely.
What are you thinking of?

  I beg your pardon, said Alice very humbly:  you had got to
the fifth bend, I think?

  I had NOT! cried the Mouse, sharply and very angrily.

  A knot! said Alice, always ready to make herself useful, and
looking anxiously about her.  Oh, do let me help to undo it!

  I shall do nothing of the sort, said the Mouse, getting up
and walking away.  You insult me by talking such nonsense!

  I didnt mean it! pleaded poor Alice.  But youre so easily
offended, you know!

  The Mouse only growled in reply.

  Please come back and finish your story! Alice called after
it and the others all joined in chorus, Yes, please do! but
the Mouse only shook its head impatiently, and walked a little
quicker.

  What a pity it wouldnt stay! sighed the Lory, as soon as it
was quite out of sight and an old Crab took the opportunity of
saying to her daughter Ah, my dear!  Let this be a lesson to you
never to lose YOUR temper!  Hold your tongue, Ma! said the
young Crab, a little snappishly.  Youre enough to try the
patience of an oyster!

  I wish I had our Dinah here, I know I do! said Alice aloud,
addressing nobody in particular.  Shed soon fetch it back!
