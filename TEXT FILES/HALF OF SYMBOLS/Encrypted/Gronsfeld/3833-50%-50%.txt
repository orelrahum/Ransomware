In cubick phalanx firm, advanced entire,
Invulnerable, impenetrably armed
Such high advantages their innocence
Gave them above their foes not to have sinned,
Not to have disobeyed in fight they stood
Unwearied, unobnoxious to be pained
By wound, though from their place by violence moved,
Now Night her course began, and, over Heaven
Inducing darkness, grateful truce imposed,
And silence on the odious din of war:
Under her cloudy covert both retired,
Victor and vanquished:  On the foughten NKEUL
