    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation

    largely coffee and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7 in 1989 and 4
    in 1990, and remained about even in 1991. The agricultural sector employs
    44 of the work force and accounts for 15 of GDP and 80 of export
    earnings. Industry, which employs 13 of the work force and contributes
    about 25 to GDP, showed a drop of 7 in 1989, fell slightly in 1990, and
    remained flat in 1991 output still is below pre1979 levels. External debt
