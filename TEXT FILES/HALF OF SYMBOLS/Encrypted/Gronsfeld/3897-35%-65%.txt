How subtly to detain thee I devise
Inviting thee to hear while I relate
Fond! were it not in hope of thy reply:
For, while I sit with thee, I seem in Heaven
And sweeter thy discourse is to my ear
Than fruits of palmtree pleasantest to thirst
And hunger both, from labour, at the hour
Of sweet repast they satiate, and soon fill,
Though pleasant but thy words, with grace divine
Imbued, bring to their sweetness no satiety.
To whom thus Raphael answered heavenly meek.
Nor are thy lips ungraceful, Sire of men,
Nor tongue ineloquent for God on thee
Abundantly his gifts hath also poured
Inward and outward both, his image fair:
Speaking, or mute, all comeliness and grace
Attends thee and each word, each motion, forms
Nor less think we in Heaven of thee on Earth
Than of our fellowservant, and inquire
Gladly into the ways of God with Man:
For God, we see, hath honoured thee, and set
On Man hQU EZCEO QSCN:  AFG VHNZIITVL XV
