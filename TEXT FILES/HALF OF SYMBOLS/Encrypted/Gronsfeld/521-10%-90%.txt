DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowlands son,
	As you have whisperd faithfully you were,
	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
	Most truly limnd and living in your face,
	Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
	That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
	Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
	Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
	Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
	And let me all your fortunes understand.

ACT III



SCENE I	A room in the palace.


	Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER

DUKE FREDERICK	Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
	But were I not the better part made mercy,
	I should not seek an absent argument
	Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
	Find out thy brother, wheresoeer he is
	Seek him with candle bring him dead or living
	Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
	To seek a living in our territory.
	Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
	Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
	Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
	Of what we think against thee.

OLIVER	O that your highness knew my heart in this!
	I never loved my brother in my life.

DUKE FREDERICK	More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors
	And let my officers of such a nature
	Make an extent upon his house and lands:
	Do this expediently and turn him going.

	Exeunt

ACT III



SCENE II	The forest.


	Enter ORLANDO, with a paper

ORLANDO	Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
	And thou, thricecrowned queen of night, survey
	With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
	Thy huntress name that my full life doth sway.
	O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
	And in their barks my thoughts Ill character
	That every eye which in this forest looks
	Shall see thy virtue witnessd every where.
	Run, run, Orlando carve on every tree
	The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.

	Exit

	Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE

CORIN	And how like you this shepherds life, Master Touchstone?

TOUCHSTONE	Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
	life, but in respect that it is a shepherds life,
	it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
	like it very well but in respect that it is
	private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
	is in the fields, it pleaseth me well but in
	respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
	is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well
	but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
	against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?

CORIN	No more but that I know the more one sickens the
	worse at ease he is and that he that wants money,
	means and content is without three good friends
	that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
	burn that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
	great cause of the night is lack of the sun that
	he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
	complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.

TOUCHSTONE	Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
	court, shepherd?

CORIN	No, truly.

TOUCHSTONE	Then thou art damned.

CORIN	Nay, I hope.

TOUCHSTONE	Truly, thou art damned like an illroasted egg, all
	on one side.

CORIN	For not being at court? Your reason.

TOUCHSTONE	Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
	good manners if thou never sawest good manners,
	then thy manners must be wicked and wickedness is
	sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
	state, shepherd.

CORIN	Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
	at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
	behavior of the country is most mockable at the
	court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
	you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
	uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.

TOUCHSTONE	Instance, briefly come, instance.

CORIN	Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
	fells, you know, are greasy.

TOUCHSTONE	Why, do not your courtiers hands sweat? and is not
	the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
	a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say come.

CORIN	Besides, our hands are hard.

TOUCHSTONE	Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
	A more sounder instance, come.

CORIN	And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
	our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
	courtiers hands are perfumed with civet.

TOUCHSTONE	Most shallow man! thou wormsmeat, in respect of a
	good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, aRG
