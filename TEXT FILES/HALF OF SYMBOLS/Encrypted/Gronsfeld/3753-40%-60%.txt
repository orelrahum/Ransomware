Smiled with superiour love, as Jupiter
On Juno smiles, when he impregns the clouds
That shed Mayflowers and pressed her matron lip
With kisses pure:  Aside the Devil turned
For envy yet with jealous leer malign
Eyed them askance, and to himself thus plained.
Sight hateful, sight tormenting! thus these two,
Imparadised in one anothers arms,
The happier Eden, shall enjoy their fill
Of bliss on bliss while I to Hell am thrust,
Where neither joy nor love, but fierce desire,
Among our other torments not the least,
Still unfulfilled with pain of longing pines.
Yet let me not forget what I have gained
From their own mouths:  All is not theirs, it seems
One fatal tree there stands, of knowledge called,
Forbidden them to taste:  Knowledge forbidden
