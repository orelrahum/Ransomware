one for catching miceoh, I beg your pardon! cried Alice again,
for this time the Mouse was bristling all over, and she felt
certain it must be really offended.  We wont talk about her any
more if youd rather not.

  We indeed! cried the Mouse, who was trembling down to the end
of his tail.  As if I would talk on such a subject!  Our family
always HATED cats:  nasty, low, vulgar things!  Dont let me hear
the name again!

  I wont indeed! said Alice, in a great hurry to change the
subject of conversation.  Are youare you fondofof dogs?
The Mouse did not answer, so Alice went on eagerly:  There is
such a nice little dog near our house I should like to show you!
A little brighteyed terrier, you know, with oh, such long curly
brown hair!  And itll fetch things when you throw them, and
itll sit up and beg for its dinner, and all sorts of thingsI
cant remember half of themand it belongs to a farmer, you
know, and he says its so useful, its worth a hundred pounds!
He says it kills all the rats andoh dear! cried Alice in a
sorrowful tone, Im afraid Ive offended it again!  For the
Mouse was swimming away from her as hard as it could go, and
making quite a commotion in the pool as it went.

  So she called softly after it, Mouse dear!  Do come back
again, and we wont talk about cats or dogs either, if you dont
like them!  When thI TXCXM JEJZH WMMZ, RB YCTNNL VRZRK JVI AYAV
