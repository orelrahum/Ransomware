Overview:
    The economy is based on service activities connected with the countrys
    strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa.
    Djibouti provides services as both a transit port for the region and an
    international transshipment and refueling center. It has few natural
    resources and little industry. The nation is, therefore, heavily dependent
    on foreign assistance to help support its balance of payments and to finance
    development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30 continues to be a
    major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35 over the last
    five years because of recession and a high population growth rate including
    immigrants and refugees.
