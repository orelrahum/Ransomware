:Venezuela Economy

Overview:
    Petroleum is the cornerstone of the economy and accounted for 23 of GDP,
    80 of central government revenues, and 80 of export earnings in 1991.
    President PEREZ introduced an economic readjustment program when he assumed
    office in February 1989. Lower tariffs and price supports, a free market
    exchange rate, and marketlinked interest rates threw the economy into
    confusion, causing an 8 decline in GDP in 1989. However, the economy
    recovered part way in 1990, and grew by 9.2 in 1991, led by the petroleum
    sector.
