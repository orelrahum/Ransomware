Be fruitful, multiply, and fill the Earth
Subdue it, and throughout dominion hold
Over fish of the sea, and fowl of the air,
And every living thing that moves on the Earth.
Wherever thus created, for no place
Is yet distinct by name, thence, as thou knowest,
He brought thee into this delicious grove,
This garden, planted with the trees of God,
Delectable both to behold and taste
And freely all their pleasant fruit for food
Gave thee all sorts are here that all the Earth yields,
Variety without end but of the tree,
Which, tasted, works knowledge of good and evil,
Thou mayest not in the day thou eatest, thou diest
Death is the penalty imposed beware,
And govern well thy appetite lest Sin
