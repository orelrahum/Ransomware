War, therefore, open or concealed, alike
My voice dissuades for what can force or guile
With him, or who deceive his mind, whose eye
Views all things at one view? He from Heavens height
All these our motions vain sees and derides,
Not more almighty to resist our might
Than wise to frustrate all our plots and wiles.
Shall we, then, live thus vilethe race of Heaven
Thus trampled, thus expelled, to suffer here
Chains and these torments? Better these than worse,
By my advice since fate inevitable
Subdues us, and omnipotent decree,
The Victors will. To suffer, as to do,
Our strength is equal nor the law unjust
That so ordains. This was at first resolved,
If we were wise, against so great a foe
Contending, and so doubtful what might fall.
I laugh when those who at the spear are bold
And venturous, if that fail them, shrink, and fear
What yet they know must followto endure
Exile, or igominy, or bonds, or pain,
The sentence of their HWPQDMVRW. XORA NA POF
