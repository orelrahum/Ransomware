:Argentina Economy

Overview:
    Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate population,
    an exportoriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.
    Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist policies, the
    economy has encountered major problems in recent years, leading to
    escalating inflation and a recession during 198890. Since 1978, Argentinas
    external debt has nearly doubled to 58 billion, creating severe debt
    servicing difficulties and hurting the countrys creditworthiness with
    international lenders. Elected in 1989, President Menem has implemented a
    comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of reversing
    Argentinas economic decline and putting it on a path of stable, sustainable
    growth.
