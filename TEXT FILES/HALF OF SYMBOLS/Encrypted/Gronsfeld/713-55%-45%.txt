Not in his shape celestial, but as man
Clad to meet man over his lucid arms
A military vest of purple flowed,
Livelier than Meliboean, or the grain
Of Sarra, worn by kings and heroes old
In time of truce Iris had dipt the woof
His starry helm unbuckled showed him prime
In manhood where youth ended by his side,
As in a glistering zodiack, hung the sword,
Satans dire dread and in his hand the spear.
Adam bowed low he, kingly, from his state
Inclined not, but his coming thus declared.
Adam, Heavens high behest no preface needs:
Sufficient that thy prayers are heard and Death,
Then due by sentence when thou didst transgress,
Defeated of his seisure many days
Given thee of grace wherein thou mayest repent,
And one bad act with many deeds well done
Mayest cover:  Well may then thy Lord, appeased,
Redeem thee quite from Deaths rapacious claim
But longer in this Paradise to GBISU
