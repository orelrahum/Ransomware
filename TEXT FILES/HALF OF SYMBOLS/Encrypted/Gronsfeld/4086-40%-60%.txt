And his salvation them who shall believe
Baptizing in the profluent stream, the sign
Of washing them from guilt of sin to life
Pure, and in mind prepared, if so befall,
For death, like that which the Redeemer died.
All nations they shall teach for, from that day,
Not only to the sons of AJTAQIQV QSPWA
