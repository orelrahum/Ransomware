:Tokelau Economy

Overview:
    Tokelaus small size, isolation, and lack of resources greatly restrain
    economic development and confine agriculture to the subsistence level. The
    people must rely on aid from New Zealand to maintain public services, annual
    aid being substantially greater than GDP. The principal sources of revenue
    come from sales of copra, postage stamps, souvenir coins, and handicrafts.
    Money is also remitted to families from relatives in New Zealand.

:Tonga Economy

Overview:
    The economys base is agriculture, which employs about 70 of the labor
    force and contributes 50 to GDP. Coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans are

    high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The manufacturing
    sector accounts for only 11 of GDP. Tourism is the primary source of hard
    currency earnings, but the island remains dependent on sizable external aid
    and remittances to offset its trade deficit.

:Trinidad and Tobago Economy

Overview:
    Trinidad and Tobagos petroleumbased economy began to emerge from a lengthy
    depression in 1990 and 1991. The economy fell sharply through most of the
    1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices. This sector accounts
    for 80 of export earnings and more than 25 of GDP. The government, in
    response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures
    that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22 in 1988. The economy showed
    signs of recovery in 1990, however, helped along by rising oil prices.
    Agriculture employs only about 11 of the labor force and produces about 3
    of GDP. Since this sector is small, it has been unable to absorb the large
    numbers of the unemployed. The government currently seeks to diversify its
    export base.
