Created pure.  But know that in the soul
Are many lesser faculties, that serve
Reason as chief among these Fancy next
Her office holds of all external things
Which the five watchful senses represent,
She forms imaginations, aery shapes,
Which Reason, joining or disjoining, frames
All what we affirm or what deny, and call
Our knowledge or opinion then retires
Into her private cell, when nature rests.
Oft in her absence mimick Fancy wakes
To imitate her but, misjoining shapes,
Wild work produces oft, and most in dreams
Ill matching words and deeds long past or late.
Some such resemblances, methinks, I find
Of our last evenings talk, in this thy dream,
But with addition strange yet be not sad.
Evil into the mind of God or Man
May come and go, so unreproved, and leave
No spot WT BUIQH GIORVI:  EJILP KLAIZ VM MWRE
