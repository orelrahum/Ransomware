:Congo Economy

Overview:
    Congos economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, a
    beginning industrial sector based largely on oil, supporting services, and a
    government characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. A reform
    program, supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in
    199091 because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and
    a heavy debtservicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay
    of the economy, providing about twothirds of government revenues and
    exports. In the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to
    finance largescale development projects with growth averaging 5 annually,
    one of the highest rates in Africa. During the period 198791, however,
    growth has slowed to an average of roughly 1.5 annually, only half the
    population growth rate.
