Information about Project Gutenberg one page

We produce about one million dollars for each hour we work.  One
hundred hours is a conservative estimate for how long it we take
to get any etext selected, entered, proofread, edited, copyright
searched and analyzed, the copyright letters written, etc.  This
projected audience is one hundred million readers.  If our value
per text is nominally estimated at one dollar, then we produce a
million dollars per hour next year we will have to do four text
files per month, thus upping our productivity to two millionhr.
The Goal of Project Gutenberg is to Give Away One Trillion Etext
Files by the December 31, 2001.  10,000 x 100,000,000Trillion
This is ten thousand titles each to one hundred million readers.

ABOUT PROJECT GUTENBERGTM ETEXTS

This PROJECT GUTENBERGtm etext, like most PROJECT GUTENBERGtm
etexts, is a "public domain" work distributed by Professor
Michael S. Hart through the Project Gutenberg Association the
"Project".  Among other things, this means that no one owns a

rules, set forth below, apply if you wish to copy and distribute
this etext under the Projects "PROJECT GUTENBERG" trademark.

To create these etexts, the Project expends considerable efforts
to identify, transcribe and proofread public domain works.
Despite these efforts, the Projects etexts and any medium they
may be on may contain "Defects".  Among other things, Defects
may take the form of incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data,
transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property
infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other etext medium,
a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be
read by your equipment.
