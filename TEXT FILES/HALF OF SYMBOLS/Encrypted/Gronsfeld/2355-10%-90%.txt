    government in 1991 pushed privatization of the economy at a faster pace than
    Russias program. The ongoing transitional period  marked by sharp
    inflation in wages and prices, lower output, lost jobs, and disruption of
    timehonored channels of supply  has brought considerable social unrest.
    Kazakhstan lacks the funds, technology, and managerial skills for a quick
    recovery of output. US firms have been enlisted to increase oil output but
    face formidable obstacles for example, oil can now reach Western markets
    only through pipelines that run across independent and sometimes
    unfriendly former Soviet republics. Finally, the end of monolithic
    Communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open. The 6 million
    Russians in the republic, formerly the favored class, now face the hostility
    of a society dominated by Muslims. Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the
    formidable obstacles to the creation of a productive, technologically
    advancing society.
