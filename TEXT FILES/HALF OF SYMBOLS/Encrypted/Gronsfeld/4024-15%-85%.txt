Where entrance up from Eden easiest climbs,
Cherubick watch and of a sword the flame
Widewaving all approach far off to fright,
And guard all passage to the tree of life:
Lest Paradise a receptacle prove
To Spirits foul, and all my trees their prey
With whose stolen fruit Man once more to delude.
He ceased and the archangelick Power prepared
For swift descent with him the cohort bright
Of watchful Cherubim: four faces each
Had, like a double Janus all their shape
Spangled with eyes more numerous than those
Of Argus, and more wakeful than to drouse,
Charmed with Arcadian pipe, the pastoral reed
Of Hermes, or his opiate rod.  Mean while,
To resalute the world with sacred light,
