  Its all about as curious as it can be, said the Gryphon.

  It all came different! the Mock Turtle repeated
thoughtfully.  I should like to hear her try and repeat
something now.  Tell her to begin.  He looked at the Gryphon as
if he thought it had some kind of authority over Alice.

  Stand up and repeat "TIS THE VOICE OF THE SLUGGARD," said
the Gryphon.

  How the creatures order one about, and make one repeat
lessons! thought Alice I might as well be at school at once.
However, she got up, and began to repeat it, but her head was so
full of the Lobster Quadrille, that she hardly knew what she was
saying, and the words came very queer indeed:

    Tis the voice of the Lobster I heard him declare,
    "You have baked me too brown, I must sugar my hair."
    As a duck with its eyelids, so he with his nose
    Trims his belt and his buttons, and turns out his toes.
