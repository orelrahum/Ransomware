:Marshall Islands Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture and tourism are the mainstays of the economy. Agricultural
    production is concentrated on small farms, and the most important commercial
    crops are coconuts, tomatoes, melons, and breadfruit. A few cattle ranches
    supply the domestic meat market. Smallscale industry is limited to
    handicrafts, fish processing, and copra. The tourist industry is the primary
    source of foreign exchange and employs about 10 of the labor force. The
    islands have few natural resources, and imports far exceed exports. In 1987
    the US Government provided grants of 40 million out of the Marshallese
    budget of 55 million.
