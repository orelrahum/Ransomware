    extensively subsidizes agricultural, fishing, and other sectors. Norway also
    maintains an extensive welfare system that helps propel publicsector
    expenditures to slightly more than 50 of the GDP and results in one of the
    highest average tax burdens in the world 54. A small country with a high
    dependence on international trade, Norway is basically an exporter of raw
    materials and semiprocessed goods, with an abundance of small and
    mediumsized firms, and is ranked among the major shipping nations. The
    country is richly endowed with natural resources  petroleum, hydropower,
    fish, forests, and minerals  and is highly dependent on its oil sector to
    keep its economy afloat. Although one of the governments main priorities is
    to reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve for years
    to come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and
    diversify the economy through tax reform and an expansionary 1992 budget.
