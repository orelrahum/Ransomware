:Nauru Economy

Overview:
    Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
    expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans
    one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World  10,000 annually.
    Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be imported, including
    fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the
    replacement of income from phosphates are serious longterm problems.
    Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
    cushion the transition.

:Nepal Economy

Overview:
    Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
    Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over
    90 of the population and accounting for 60 of GDP. Industrial activity is
    limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce jute,
    sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Production of textiles and carpets has
    expanded recently and accounted for 87 of foreign exchange earnings in
    FY89. Apart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable
    natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production
    in the late 1980s grew by about 5, as compared with annual population
    growth of 2.6. Forty percent or more of the population is undernourished
    partly because of poor distribution. Since May 1991, the government has been
    encouraging privatization and foreign investment. It has introduced policies
    to eliminate many business licenses and registration requirements in order
    to simplify domestic and foreign investment procedures. Economic prospects
    for the 1990s remain poor because the economy starts from such a low base.

    GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25 of GDP and is led by the
    foodprocessing, oilrefining, and metalworking industries. The highly
    mechanized agricultural sector employs only 5 of the labor force, but
    provides large surpluses for export and the domestic foodprocessing
    industry. An unemployment rate of 6.2 and a sizable budget deficit are
    currently the most serious economic problems.
