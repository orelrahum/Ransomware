Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,
and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others
are not officially recognized by the US Government. Nation refers to a
people politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
Dependent area refers to a broad category of political entities that are
associated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually
the shortform names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. The
longform name is included in the Government section, and an entry of
none indicates a longform name does not exist. In some instances, no
shortform name exists  then the longform name must serve for all usages.

Gross domestic product GDP: The value of all goods and services produced
domestically.

Gross national product GNP: The value of all goods and services produced
domestically plus income earned abroad, minus income earned by foreigners
from domestic production.

GNPGDP methodology: In the Economy section, GNPGDP dollar estimates for
the OECD countries, the former Soviet republics, and the East European
countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP calculations rather
than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method
normally involves the use of international dollar price weights, which are
applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy.
In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the
statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing
for the quality of goods and services. The division of a PPP GNPGDP estimate
in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP
conversion rate. One thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods
in the US as one thousand dollars  converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate  will buy in the other country. GNPGDP estimates for the
LDCs, on the other hand, are based on the conversion of GNPGDP estimates in
local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates. One
caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNPGDP
in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when
GNPGDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer
estimates the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures
similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency
exchange rate procedures. Finally, as academic research moves forward on the
PPP method, we hope to convert all GNPGDP estimates to this method in future
editions of The World Factbook.

Growth rate population: The annual percent change in the population,
resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over deaths and the balance
