DISTRIBUTION UNDER "PROJECT GUTENBERGtm"

You may distribute copies of this etext electronically, or by
disk, book or any other medium if you either delete this "Small
Print!" and all other references to Project Gutenberg, or:

1  Only give exact copies of it.  Among other things, this re
     quires that you do not remove, alter or modify the etext or
     this "small print!" statement.  You may however, if you
     wish, distribute this etext in machine readable binary,
     compressed, markup, or proprietary form, including any
     form resulting from conversion by word processing or hyper
     text software, but only so long as EITHER:

       The etext, when displayed, is clearly readable.  We
          consider an etext not clearly readable if it
          contains characters other than those intended by the
          author of the work, although tilde ~, asterisk 
          and underline  characters may be used to convey
          punctuation intended by the author, and additional
          characters may be used to indicate hypertext links.

       The etext may be readily converted by the reader at no
          expense into plain ASCII, EBCDIC or equivalent form
          by the program that displays the etext as is the
          case, for instance, with most word processors.

       You provide, or agree to also provide on request at no
          additional cost, fee or expense, a copy of the etext
          in its original plain ASCII form or in EBCDIC or
          other equivalent proprietary form.

2   Honor the etext refund and replacement provisions of this
     "Small Print!" statement.

3  Pay a trademark license fee of 20 twenty percent of the
     net profits you derive from distributing this etext under
     the trademark, determined in accordance with generally
     accepted accounting practices.  The license fee:

       Is required only if you derive such profits.  In
          distributing under our trademark, you incur no
          obligation to charge money or earn profits for your
          distribution.

       Shall be paid to "Project Gutenberg Association 
          Illinois Benedictine College" or to such other person
          as the Project Gutenberg Association may direct
          within the 60 days following each date you prepare or

          return with respect to your income for that year.
