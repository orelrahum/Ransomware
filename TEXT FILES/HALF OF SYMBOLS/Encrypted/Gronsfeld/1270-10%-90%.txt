:World Economy

Overview:
    Aggregate world output in 1991 increased by 1.3, in contrast to estimated
    2 growth in 1990 and 3 growth in 1989. In 1991, the developed countries
    grew by 2.5 and the LDCs by 3.5, these gains being offset by a 1015 drop
    in the former Communistdominated areas of the USSR and Eastern Europe. As
    usual, results among individual countries differed widely. In the developed
    group, Japan led with 4.5, the West European members averaged 1.2, and the
    recessionplagued United States lagged,with GDP down 0.7. As for the 15
    former Soviet republics and the seven nations of Eastern Europe, output
    plummeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the
    rules of the game and in the channels of production and exchange. China and
    the Four Dragons performed well in 1991 but many of the other developing
    countries are mired in poverty and political instability. For the world as a
    whole, the addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already
    overcrowded globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution,
    desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine.

Industries:
    industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology, especially in
    computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical
    equipment most of these advances take place in OECD nations only a small
    portion of nonOECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
    technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial
    nations and the lessdeveloped countries continues to widen the rapid
    development of new industrial and agricultural technology is complicating
    already grim environmental problems

:World Economy

Agriculture:
    the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last
    20 years. The annual production of cereals, for instance, has risen by 50,
    from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion metric tons
    production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
    increases in planted areas while global production is sufficient for
    aggregate demand, about onefifth of the worlds population remains
    malnourished, primarily because local production cannot adequately provide
    for large and rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for
    food imports conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
    recent years has exacerbated the consequences of all other factors
