	But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
	Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?

	Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind

PHEBE	I would not be thy executioner:
	I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
	Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye:
	Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
	That eyes, that are the frailst and softest things,
	Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
	Should be calld tyrants, butchers, murderers!
	Now I do frown on thee with all my heart
	And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
	Now counterfeit to swoon why now fall down
	Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
	Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
	Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
	Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
	Some scar of it lean but upon a rush,
	The cicatrice and capable impressure
	Thy palm some moment keeps but now mine eyes,
	Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
	Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
	That can do hurt.

SILVIUS	                  O dear Phebe,
	If ever,as that ever may be near,
	You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
	Then shall you know the wounds invisible
	That loves keen arrows make.

PHEBE	But till that time
	Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
	Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not
	As till that time I shall not pity thee.

ROSALIND	And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
	That you insult, exult, and all at once,
	Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,
	As, by my faith, I see no more in you
	Than without candle may go dark to bed
	Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
	Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
	I see no more in you than in the ordinary
	Of natures salework. Ods my little life,
	I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
	No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
	Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
	Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
	That can entame my spirits to your worship.
	You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
	Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
	You are a thousand times a properer man
	Than she a woman: tis such fools as you
	That makes the world full of illfavourd children:
	Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her
	And out of you she sees herself more proper
	Than any of her lineaments can show her.
	But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
	And thank heaven, fasting, for a good mans love:
	For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
	Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
	Cry the man mercy love him take his offer:
	Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
	So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.

PHEBE	Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
	I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.

ROSALIND	Hes fallen in love with your foulness and shell
	fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
	she answers thee with frowning looks, Ill sauce her
	with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?

PHEBE	For no ill will I bear you.

ROSALIND	I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
	For I am falser than vows made in wine:
	Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
	Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
	Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
	Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
	And be not proud: though all the world could see,
	None could be so abused in sight as he.
	Come, to our flock.

	Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN

PHEBE	Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
	Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe,

PHEBE	                  Ha, what sayst thou, Silvius?

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, pity me.

PHEBE	Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
