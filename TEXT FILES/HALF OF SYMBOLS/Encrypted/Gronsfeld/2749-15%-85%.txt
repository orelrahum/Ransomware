    of light manufactures. Following two years of droughtinduced economic
    decline, the economy made a strong recovery in 1990 as a result of a
    bountiful harvest, continued export growth, and higher domestic investment.
    Continued high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular support for

    reform. Nonetheless, the government appears committed to implementing its
    IMFsupported structural adjustment program and to servicing its foreign
    debt.
