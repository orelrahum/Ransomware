:France Economy

Overview:
    One of the worlds most developed economies, France has substantial
    agricultural resources and a highly diversified modern industrial sector.
    Large tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and
    subsidies have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in
    Western Europe. France is largely selfsufficient in agricultural products
    and is a major exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector
    generates about onequarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has
    become crucial to the economy. After expanding at a rapid 3.8 pace during
    the period 198889, the economy slowed down in 1990, with growth of 1.5 in
    1990 and 1.4 in 1991 growth in 1992 is expected to be about 2. The
    economy has had difficulty generating enough jobs for new entrants into the
    labor force, resulting in a high unemployment rate, which rose to almost 10
    in 1991. The steadily advancing economic integration within the European
    Community is a major force affecting the fortunes of the various economic
    sectors.
