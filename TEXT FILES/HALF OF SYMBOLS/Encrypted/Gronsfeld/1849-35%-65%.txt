Down sunk a hollow bottom broad and deep,
Capacious bed of waters:  Thither they
Hasted with glad precipitance, uprolled,
As drops on dust conglobing from the dry:
Part rise in crystal wall, or ridge direct,
For haste such flight the great command impressed
On the swift floods:  As armies at the call
Of trumpet for of armies thou hast heard
Troop to their standard so the watery throng,
Wave rolling after wave, where way they found,
If steep, with torrent rapture, if through plain,
Softebbing nor withstood them rock or hill
But they, or under ground, or circuit wide
With serpent errour wandering, found their way,
And on the washy oose deep channels wore
Easy, ere God had bid the ground be dry,
All but within those banks, where rivers now
Stream, and perpetual draw their humid train.
The dry land, Earth and the great receptacle
Of congregated waters, he called Seas:
And saw that it was good and said, Let the Earth
Put forth the verdant grass, herb yielding seed,
And fruittree yielding fruit after her kind,
Whose seed is in herself upon the Earth.
He scarce had said, when the bare Earth, till then
Desart and bare, unsightly, unadorned,
Brought forth the tender grass, whose verdure clad
Her universal face with pleasant green
Then herbs of every leaf, that sudden flowered
Opening their various colours, and made gay
Her bosom, smelling sweet: and, these scarce blown,
Forth flourished thick the clustering vine, forth crept
The swelling gourd, up stood the corny reed
Embattled in her field, and the humble shrub,
And bush with frizzled hair implicit:  Last
Rose, as in dance, the stately trees, and spread
Their branches hung with copious fruit, or gemmed
Their blossoms:  With high woods the hills were crowned
With tufts the valleys, and each fountain side
With borders long the rivers: that Earth POF
