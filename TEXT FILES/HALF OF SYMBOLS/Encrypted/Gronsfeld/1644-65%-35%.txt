	you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
	please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love
	you bear to womenas I perceive by your simpering,
	none of you hates themthat between you and the
	women the play may please. If I were a woman I
	would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
	me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I
	defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good
	beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my
	kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me fareweUT.
