  Lets go on with the game, the Queen said to Alice and Alice
was too much frightened to say a word, but slowly followed her
back to the croquetground.

  The other guests had taken advantage of the Queens absence,
and were resting in the shade:  however, the moment they saw her,
they hurried back to the game, the Queen merely remarking that a
moments delay would cost them their lives.

  All the time they were playing the Queen never left off
quarrelling with the other players, and shouting Off with his
head! or Off with her head!  Those whom she sentenced were
taken into custody by the soldiers, who of course had to leave
off being arches to do this, so that by the end of half an hour
or so there were no arches left, and all the players, except the
King, the Queen, and Alice, were in custody and under sentence of
execution.

  Then the Queen left off, quite out of breath, and said to
Alice, Have you seen the Mock Turtle yet?

  No, said Alice.  I dont even know what a Mock Turtle is.

  Its the thing Mock Turtle Soup is made from, said the Queen.

  I never saw one, or heard of one, said Alice.

  Come on, then, said the Queen, and he shall tell you his
history,

  As they walked off together, Alice heard the King say in a low
voice, to the company generally, You are all pardoned.  Come,
THATS a good thing! she said to herself, for she had felt quite
unhappy at the number of executions the Queen had ordered.

  They very soon came upon a Gryphon, lying fast asleep in the
sun.  IF you dont know what a Gryphon is, look at the picture.
Up, lazy thing! said the Queen, and take this young lady to
see the Mock Turtle, and to hear his history.  I must go back and
see after some executions I have ordered and she walked off,
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like
the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would
be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
Queen:  so she waited.

  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the
Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  What fun!
said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.

  What IS the fun? said Alice.

  Why, SHE, said the Gryphon.  Its all her fancy, that:  they
never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!

  Everybody says "come on!" here, thought Alice, as she went
slowly after it:  I never was so SUIIYNL FJQUC QR DQP TH TNNG,
