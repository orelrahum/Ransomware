JAQUES	Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
	circle. Ill go sleep, if I can if I cannot, Ill
	rail against all the firstborn of Egypt.

AMIENS	And Ill go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.

SCENE VI	The forest.


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

ADAM	Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!
	Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
	kind master.

ORLANDO	Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live
	a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little.
	If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I
	will either be food for it or bring it for food to
	thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
	For my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at
	the arms end: I will here be with thee presently
	and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
	give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
	come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
	thou lookest cheerly, and Ill be with thee quickly.
	Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
	thee to some shelter and thou shalt not die for
	lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this
	desert. Cheerly, good Adam!

	Exeunt
