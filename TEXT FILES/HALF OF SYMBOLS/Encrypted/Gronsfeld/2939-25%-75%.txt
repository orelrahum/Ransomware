:Mexico Economy

Overview:
    Mexicos economy is a mixture of stateowned industrial plants notably
    oil, private manufacturing and services, and both largescale and
    traditional agriculture. In the 1980s, Mexico experienced severe economic
    difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as world petroleum
    prices fell rapid population growth outstripped the domestic food supply
    and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate became more acute.
    Growth in national output, however, is recovering, rising from 1.4 in 1988
    to 4 in 1990 and again in 1991. The US is Mexicos major trading partner,
    accounting for twothirds of its exports and imports. After petroleum,
    border assembly plants and tourism are the largest earners of foreign
    exchange. The government, in consultation with international economic
    agencies, is implementing programs to stabilize the economy and foster
    growth. In 1991 the government began negotiations with the US and Canada on
    a free trade agreement.

:Micronesia, Federated States of Economy

Overview:
    Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing. The
    islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for highgrade
    phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness
    of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development.
    Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the
    US pledged to spend 1 billion in the islands in the l990s. Geographical
    isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to
    longterm growth.

:Moldova Economy

Overview:
    Moldova, the nexttosmallest of the former Soviet republics in area, is the
    most densely inhabited. Moldova has a little more than 1 of the population,
    labor force, capital stock, and output of the former Soviet Union. Living
    standards have been below average for the European USSR. The country enjoys
    a favorable climate, and economic development has been primarily based on
    agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Industry
    accounts for 20 of the labor force, whereas agriculture employs more than
    onethird. Moldova has no major mineral resources and has depended on the
    former Soviet republics for coal, oil, gas, steel, most electronic
    equipment, machine tools, and major consumer durables such as automobiles.
    Its industrial and agricultural products, in turn, have been exported to the
    other former Soviet republics. Moldova has freed prices on most goods and
    has legalized private ownership of property, including agricultural land.
    Moldovas economic prospects are dimmed by the difficulties of moving toward
    a market economy and the political problems of redefining ties to the other
    former Soviet republics and Romania.

:Monaco Economy

Overview:
    Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular resort,
    attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The Principality has

    and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established
    residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices.
    About 50 of Monacos annual revenue comes from valueadded taxes on hotels,
    banks, and the industrial sector about 25 of revenue comes from tourism.

:Mongolia Economy

Overview:
    Mongolias severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses of
    unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic activity
    traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock 
    Mongolia has the highest number of livestock per person in the world. In
    recent years extensive mineral resources have been developed with Soviet
    support. The mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin,
    tungsten, and gold account for a large part of industrial production. Timber
    and fishing are also important sectors. In 199192 Mongolian leadership is
    struggling with severe economic dislocations, mainly attributable to the
    economic crumbling of the USSR, by far Mongolias leading trade and
    development partner. Moscow almost certainly cut aid in 1991, and the
    dissolution of the USSR at yearend 1991 makes prospects for aid quite bleak
    for 1992. Industry in 199192 has been hit hard by energy shortages, mainly
    due to disruptions in coal production and shortfalls in petroleum imports.
    The government is moving away from the Sovietstyle centrally planned
    economy through privatization and price reform.

:Morocco Economy

Overview:
    The economy had recovered moderately in 1990 because of: the resolution of a
    trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales, a rebound in textile
    sales to the EC, lower prices for food imports, a sharp increase in worker
    remittances, increased Arab donor aid, and generous debt rescheduling
    agreements. Economic performance in 1991 was mixed. A record harvest helped
    real GDP advance by 4.2, although nonagricultural output grew by less than
    1. Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial policies triggered
    rapid credit and monetary growth. Despite recovery of domestic demand,
    import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely affected by
    phosphate marketing difficulties. In January 1992, Morocco reached a new
    12month standby arrangement for 129 million with the IMF. In February
    1992, the Paris Club rescheduled 1.4 billion of Moroccos commercial debt.
    This is thought to be Moroccos last rescheduling. By 1993 the Moroccan
    authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service obligations
    without additional rescheduling. Servicing this large debt, high
    unemployment, and Moroccos vulnerability to external economic forces remain
    severe longterm problems.

:Mozambique Economy

Overview:
    One of Africas poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to exploit the
    economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and
    transportation resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and
    investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of
    internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a growing
    foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic
    reform policy, has resulted in successive years of economic growth since
    1985. Agricultural output, nevertheless, is at about only 75 of its 1981
    level, and grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 2040 of
    capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat.
    The continuation of civil strife through 1991 has dimmed chances of foreign
    investment, and growth was a mere 1. Living standards, already abysmally
    low, dropped by 34 in both 1990 and 1991.

    and tungsten, and it has substantial resources of coal. More than half the
    population depends on agriculture largely subsistence agriculture for its
    livelihood.

:Nauru Economy

Overview:
    Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
    expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans
    one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World  10,000 annually.
    Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be imported, including
    fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the
    replacement of income from phosphates are serious longterm problems.
    Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
    cushion the transition.

:Nepal Economy

Overview:
    Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world.
    Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over
    90 of the population and accounting for 60 of GDP. Industrial activity is
    limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce jute,
    sugarcane, tobacco, and grain. Production of textiles and carpets has
    expanded recently and accounted for 87 of foreign exchange earnings in
    FY89. Apart from agricultural land and forests, the only other exploitable
    natural resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production
    in the late 1980s grew by about 5, as compared with annual population
    growth of 2.6. Forty percent or more of the population is undernourished
    partly because of poor distribution. Since May 1991, the government has been
    encouraging privatization and foreign investment. It has introduced policies
    to eliminate many business licenses and registration requirements in order
    to simplify domestic and foreign investment procedures. Economic prospects
    for the 1990s remain poor because the economy starts from such a low base.

:Netherlands Economy

Overview:
    This highly developed and affluent economy is based on private enterprise.
    The government makes its presence felt, however, through many regulations,
    permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting most aspects of economic
    activity. The trade and financial services sector contributes over 50 of
    GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25 of GDP and is led by the
    foodprocessing, oilrefining, and metalworking industries. The highly
    mechanized agricultural sector employs only 5 of the labor force, but
    provides large surpluses for export and the domestic foodprocessing
    industry. An unemployment rate of 6.2 and a sizable budget deficit are
    currently the most serious economic problems.

:New Caledonia Economy

Overview:
    New Caledonia has more than 25 of the worlds known nickel resources. In

    for about 25 of imports.

:New Zealand Economy

Overview:
    Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian economy dependent
    on a guaranteed British market to an open free market economy that can
    compete on the global scene. The government has hoped that dynamic growth
    would boost real incomes, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the
    expansion of welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: inflation is
    down from doubledigit levels, but growth has been sluggish and
    unemployment, always a highly sensitive issue, has exceeded 10 since May
    1991. In 1988, GDP fell by 1, in 1989 grew by a moderate 2.4, and was flat
    in 199091.

:Nicaragua Economy

Overview:
    Government control of the economy historically has been extensive, although
    the CHAMORRO government has pledged to greatly reduce intervention. Four
    private banks have been licensed, and the government has liberalized foreign
    trade and abolished price controls on most goods. Over 50 of the
    agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned. Sandinista economic
    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation
    of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities,
    largely coffee and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7 in 1989 and 4
    in 1990, and remained about even in 1991. The agricultural sector employs
    44 of the work force and accounts for 15 of GDP and 80 of export
    earnings. Industry, which employs 13 of the work force and contributes
    about 25 to GDP, showed a drop of 7 in 1989, fell slightly in 1990, and
    remained flat in 1991 output still is below pre1979 levels. External debt
    is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis. In 1991 the
    inflation rate was 766, down sharply from the 13,490 of 1990.

:Niger Economy

Overview:
    About 90 of the population is engaged in farming and stock raising,
    activities that generate almost half the national income. The economy also
    depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits. Uranium
    production grew rapidly in the mid1970s, but tapered off in the early 1980s
    when world prices declined. France is a major customer, while Germany,
    Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases. The depressed demand for
    uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy, a severe
    trade imbalance, and a mounting external debt.
