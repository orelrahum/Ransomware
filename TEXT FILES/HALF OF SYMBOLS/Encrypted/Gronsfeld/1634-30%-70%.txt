TOUCHSTONE	So so is good, very good, very excellent good and
	yet it is not it is but so so. Art thou wise?

WILLIAM	Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.

TOUCHSTONE	Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,
	The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man
	knows himself to be a fool. The heathen
	philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
	would open his lips when he put it into his mouth
	meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
	lips to open. You do love this maid?

WILLIAM	I do, sir.

TOUCHSTONE	Give me your hand. Art thou learned?

WILLIAM	No, sir.

TOUCHSTONE	Then learn this of me: to have, is to have for it
	is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out
	of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty
	the other for all your writers do consent that ipse
	is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.

WILLIAM	Which he, sir?

TOUCHSTONE	He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
	clown, abandon,which is in the vulgar leave,the
	society,which in the boorish is company,of this
	female,which in the common is woman which
	together is, abandon the society of this female, or,
	clown, thou perishest or, to thy better
	understanding, diest or, to wit I kill theG, MJSI
