ACT II



SCENE III	Before OLIVERS house.


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM, meeting

ORLANDO	Whos there?

ADAM	What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
	O my sweet master! O you memory
	Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
	Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
	And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
	Why would you be so fond to overcome
	The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
	Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
	Know you not, master, to some kind of men
	Their graces serve them but as enemies?
	No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
	Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
	O, what a world is this, when what is comely
	Envenoms him that bears it!

ORLANDO	Why, whats the matter?

ADAM	O unhappy youth!
	Come not within these doors within this roof
	The enemy of all your graces lives:
	Your brotherno, no brother yet the son
	Yet not the son, I will not call him son
	Of him I was about to call his father
	Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
	To burn the lodging where you use to lie
	And you within it: if he fail of that,
	He will have other meISA VO LCX BTY VON.
