:Ghana Economy

Overview:
    Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been
    implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including
    moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily
    dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not
    spread substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending
    peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
    democratic government have been boosting government expenditures and
    undercutting structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in
    1990. Much of the economic improvement in 1991 was caused by favorable
    weather following a severe drought the previous year that led to plentiful
    harvests in Ghanas agriculturally based economy.

:Gibraltar Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends heavily on British defense expenditures, revenue from
    tourists, fees for services to shipping, and revenues from banking and

    employment. Construction workers are particularly affected when government
    expenditures are cut.

:Greece Economy

Overview:
    Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic entrepreneurial
    system overlaid in 198189 by a socialist government that enlarged the
    public sector from 55 of GDP in 1981 to about 70 when Prime Minister
    Mitsotakis took office. Tourism continues as a major industry, and
    agriculture  although handicapped by geographic limitations and fragmented,
    small farms  is selfsufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal
    feedstuffs. The Mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic
    problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations, which
    had neglected the runaway budget deficit, a ballooning current account
    deficit, and accelerating inflation. In early 1991, the government secured a
    2.5 billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet
    imposed on a member country, as the EC finally ran out of patience with
    Greeces failure to put its financial affairs in order. Over the next three
    years, Athens must bring inflation down to 7, cut the current account
    deficit and central government borrowing as a percentage of GDP, slash
    publicsector employment by 10, curb publicsector pay raises, and broaden
    the tax base.
