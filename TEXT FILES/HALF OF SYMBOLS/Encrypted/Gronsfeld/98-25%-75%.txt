:United Arab Emirates Economy

Overview:
    The UAE has an open economy with one of the worlds highest incomes per
    capita outside the OECD nations. This wealth is based on oil and gas, and
    the fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities.
    Since 1973, when petroleum prices shot up, the UAE has undergone a profound
    transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to
    a modern state with a high standard of living. At present levels of
    production, crude oil reserves should last for over 100 years.

:United Kingdom Economy

Overview:
    The UK is one of the worlds great trading powers and financial centers, and
    its economy ranks among the four largest in Europe. The economy is
    essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture of social welfare
    programs and government ownership. Prime Minister MAJOR has continued the
    basic thrust of THATCHERs efforts to halt the expansion of welfare measures
    and promote extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.
    Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European
    standards, producing about 60 of food needs with only 1 of the labor
    force. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing
    about 27 of the work force and generating 22 of GDP. The UK is an
    energyrich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves primary
    energy production accounts for 12 of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
    industrial nation. In mid1990 the economy fell into recession after eight
    years of strong economic expansion, which had raised national output by one
    quarter. Britains inflation rate, which has been consistently well above
    those of her major trading partners, declined significantly in 1991. Between
    1986 and 1990 unemployment fell from 11 to about 6, but crept back up to
    8 in 1991 because of the economic slowdown. As a major trading nation, the
    UK will continue to be greatly affected by world boom or recession, swings
    in the international oil market, productivity trends in domestic industry,
    and the terms on which the economic integration of Europe proceeds.
