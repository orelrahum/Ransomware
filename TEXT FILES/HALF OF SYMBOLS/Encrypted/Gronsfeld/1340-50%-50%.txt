  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars
making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,
very gravely, I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.

  Why? said the Caterpillar.

  Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not
think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.

  Come back! the Caterpillar called after her.  Ive something
important to say!

  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back
again.

  Keep your temper, said the Caterpillar.

  Is that all? said Alice, swallowing down her anger as well as
she could.

  No, said the Caterpillar.

  Alice thought she might as well wait, as she had nothing else
to do, and perhaps after all it might tell her something worth
hearing.  For some minutes it puffed away without speaking, but
at last it unfolded its arms, took the hookah out of its mouth
again, and said, So you think youre changed, do you?

  Im afraid I am, sir, said Alice I cant remember things as
I usedand I dont keep the same size for ten minutes together!

  Cant remember WHAT things? said the Caterpillar.

  Well, Ive tried to say "HOW DOTH THE LITTLE BUSY BEE," but it
all came different! Alice replied in a very melancholy voice.

  Repeat, "YOU ARE OLD, FATHER WILLIAM," said the Caterpillar.

  Alice folded her hands, and began:

    You are old, Father William, the young man said,
      And your hair has become very white
    And yet you incessantly stand on your head
      Do you think, at your age, it is right?

    In my youth, Father William replied to his son,
      I feared it might injure the brain
    But, now that Im perfectly sure I have none,
      Why, I do it again and again.

    You are old, said the youth, as I mentioned before,
      And have grown most uncommonly fat
    Yet you turned a backsomersault in at the door
      Pray, what is the reason of that?

    In my youth, said the sage, as he shook his grey locks,
      I kept all my limbs very supple
    By the use of this ointmentone shilling the box
      Allow me to sell you a couple?

    You are old, said the youth, and your jaws are too weak
      For anything tougher than suet
    Yet you finished the goose, with the bones and the beak
      Pray how did you manage to do it?

    In my youth, said his father, I took to the law,
      And argued each case with my wife
    And the muscular strength, which it gave to my jaw,
      Has lasted the rest of my life.

    You are old, said the youth, one would hardly suppose
      That your eye was as steady as ever
    Yet you balanced an eel on the end of your nose
      What made you so awfully clever?

    I have answered three questions, and that is enough,
      Said his father dont give yourself airs!
    Do you think I can listen all day to such stuff?
      Be off, or Ill kick you down stairs!


  That is not said right, said the Caterpillar.

  Not QUITE right, Im afraid, said Alice, timidly some of the
words have got altered.

  It is wrong from beginning to end, said the Caterpillar
decidedly, and there was silence for some minutes.

  The Caterpillar was the first to speak.

  What size do you want to be? it asked.

  Oh, Im not particular as to size, Alice hastily replied
only one doesnt like changing so often, you know.

  I DONT know, said the Caterpillar.

  Alice said nothing:  she had never been so much contradicted in
her life before, and she felt that she was losing her temper.

  Are you content now? said the Caterpillar.

  Well, I should like to be a LITTLE larger, sir, if you
wouldnt mind, said Alice:  three inches is such a wretched
height to be.

  It is a very good height indeed! said the Caterpillar
angrily, rearing itself upright as it spoke it was exactly three
inches high.

  But Im not used to it! pleaded poor Alice in a piteous tone.
And she thought of herself, I wish the creatures wouldnt be so
easily offended!

  Youll get used to it in time, said the Caterpillar and it
put the hookah into its mouth and began smoking again.

  This time Alice waited patiently until it chose to speak again.
In a minute or two the Caterpillar took the hookah out of its
mouth and yawned once or twice, and shook itself.  Then it got
down off the mushroom, and crawled away in the grass, merely
remarking as it went, One side will make you grow taller, and
the other side will make you grow shorter.

  One side of WHAT?  The other side of WHAT? thought Alice to
herself.

  Of the mushroom, said the Caterpillar, just as if she had
asked it aloud and in another moment it was out of sight.

  Alice remained looking thoughtfully at the mushroom for a
minute, trying to make out which were the two sides of it and as
it was perfectly round, she found this a very difficult question.
However, at last she stretched her arms round it as far as they
would go, and broke off a bit of the edge with each hand.

  And now which is which? she said to herself, and nibbled a
little of the righthand bit to try the effect:  the next moment
she felt a violent blow underneath her chin:  it had struck her
foot!

  She was a good deal frightened by this very sudden change, but
she felt that there was no time to be lost, as she was shrinking
rapidly so she set to work at once to eat some of the other bit.
Her chin was pressed so closely against her foot, that there was
hardly room to open her mouth but she did it at last, and
managed to swallow a morsel of the lefthand bit.


                                               

                                            

                                               

  Come, my heads free at last! said Alice in a tone of
delight, which changed into alarm in another moment, when she
found that her shoulders were nowhere to be found:  all she could
see, when she looked down, was an immense length of neck, which
seemed to rise like a stalk out of a sea of green leaves that lay
far below her.

  What CAN all that green stuff be? said Alice.  And where
HAVE my shoulders got to?  And oh, my poor hands, how is it I
cant see you?  She was moving them about as she spoke, but no
result seemed to follow, except a little shaking among the
distant green leaves.

  As there seemed to be no chance of getting her hands up to her
head, she tried to get her head down to them, and was delighted
to find that her neck would bend about easily in any direction,
like a serpent.  She had just succeeded in curving it down into a
graceful zigzag, and was going to dive in among the leaves, which
she found to be nothing but the tops of the trees under which she
had been wandering, when a sharp hiss made her draw back in a
hurry:  a large pigeon had flown into her face, and was beating
her violently with its wings.

  Serpent! screamed the Pigeon.

  Im NOT a serpent! said Alice indignantly.  Let me alone!

  Serpent, I say again! repeated the Pigeon, but in a more
subdued tone, and added with a kind of sob, Ive tried every
way, and nothing seems to suit them!

  I havent the least idea what youre talking about, said
Alice.

  Ive tried the roots of trees, and Ive tried banks, and Ive
tried hedges, the Pigeon went on, without attending to her but
those serpents!  Theres no pleasing them!

  Alice was more and more puzzled, but she thought there was no
use in saying anything more till the Pigeon had finished.

  As if it wasnt trouble enough hatching the eggs, said the
Pigeon but I must be on the lookout for serpents night and
day!  Why, I havent had a wink of sleep these three weeks!

  Im very sorry youve been annoyed, said Alice, who was
beginning to see its meaning.

  And just as Id taken the highest tree in the wood, continued
the Pigeon, raising its voice to a shriek, and just as I was
thinking I should be free of them at last, they must needs come
wriggling down from the sky!  Ugh, Serpent!

  But Im NOT a serpent, I tell you! said Alice.  Im aIm
a

  Well!  WHAT are you? said the Pigeon.  I can see youre
trying to invent something!

  IIm a little girl, said Alice, rather doubtfully, as she
remembered the number of changes she had gone through that day.

  A likely story indeed! said the Pigeon in a tone of the
deepest contempt.  Ive seen a good many little girls in my
time, but never ONE with such a neck as that!  No, no!  Youre a
serpent and theres no use denying it.  I suppose youll be
telling me next that you never tasted an egg!

  I HAVE tasted eggs, certainly, said Alice, who was a very
truthful child but little girls eat eggs quite as much as
serpents do, you know.

  I dont believe it, said the Pigeon but if they do, why
then theyre a kind of serpent, thats all I can say.

  This was such a new idea to Alice, that she was quite silent
for a minute or two, which gave the Pigeon the opportunity of
adding, Youre looking for eggs, I know THAT well enough and
what does it matter to me whether youre a little girl WW I
