	Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn

ORLANDO	Forbear, and eat no more.

JAQUES	Why, I have eat none yet.

ORLANDO	Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.

JAQUES	Of what kind should this cock come of?

DUKE SENIOR	Art thou thus boldend, man, by thy distress,
	Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
	That in civility thou seemst so empty?

ORLANDO	You touchd my vein at first: the thorny point
	Of bare distress hath taen from me the show
	Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
	And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
	He dies that touches any of this fruit
	Till I and my affairs are answered.

JAQUES	An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.

DUKE SENIOR	What would yQU QIZH? DSBA OJVVLNVIVX WOJTQ NQRLM
