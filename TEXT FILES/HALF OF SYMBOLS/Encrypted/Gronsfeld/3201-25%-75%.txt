TOUCHSTONE	Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
	stagger in this attempt for here we have no temple
	but the wood, no assembly but hornbeasts. But what

	knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
	his wife tis none of his own getting. Horns?

	hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
	therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
	worthier than D AMSUILM, UO RA XKJ JVAMMMCD XN E
