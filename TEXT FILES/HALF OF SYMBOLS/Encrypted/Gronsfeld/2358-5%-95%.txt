:Kenya Economy

Overview:
    Kenyas 3.6 annual population growth rate  one of the highest in the world
     presents a serious problem for the countrys economy. In the meantime, GDP
    growth in the near term has kept slightly ahead of population  annually
    averaging 4.9 in the 198690 period. Undependable weather conditions and a
    shortage of arable land hamper longterm growth in agriculture, the leading
    economic sector. In 1991, deficient rainfall, stagnant export volume, and
    sagging export prices held economic growth below the allimportant
    USWDTFBKOW OVRBXO OQLCTE.
