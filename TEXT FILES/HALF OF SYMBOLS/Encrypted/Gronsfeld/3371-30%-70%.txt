clinical trials:  It is 1 a highly statistical discipline that 2 does
not require halftones but can satisfy the needs of its audience with line
illustrations and graphic material, and 3 there is a need for the speedy
dissemination of highquality research results.  Clinical trials are
research activities that involve the administration of a test treatment

additional information on OJCCT concerning its editorinchief, editorial
board, editorial content, and the types of articles it publishes
including peerreviewed research reports and reviews, as well as
features shared by other traditional hardcopy journals.

Among the advantages of the electronic format are faster dissemination of
information, including raw data, and the absence of space constraints

situation when it comes to citations.  Nor are there any issues.  AAASs
capacity to download materials directly from the journal to a
subscribers printer, hard drive, or floppy disk helps ensure highly
accurate transcription.  Other features of OJCCT include onscreen alerts
that allow linkage of subsequently published docDUJVVS CW XKJ SYRONVCL
