    The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented, with a large
    dose of government ownership remaining in mining, energy, and banking. In
    the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita
    output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World
    Bank support in the mid1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity
    program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in
    July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
    activity, but the slide halted late in the year, and output rose 2.4 in
    1991. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
    government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the
    singledigit level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since
    mid1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
    in September 1991, and, although it faces 14 billion in arrears on its
    external debt, is working to pay some 1.8 billion of these to the IMF and
    World Bank by 1993.
