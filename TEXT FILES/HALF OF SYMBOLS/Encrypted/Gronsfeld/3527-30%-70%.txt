where somebody is attempting to decide whether or not to scan this or
film that or to learn whether or not someone has already done so, LYNCH

The only way to make those linkages would be to perform a tremendous
amount of realtime lookup, which would be awkward at best, or
periodically to yank the whole file from RUQR DSH TJBHP KT JOELSWA XVJA
