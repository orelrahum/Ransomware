to play croquet.

  Then they both bowed low, and their curls got entangled
together.

  Alice laughed so much at this, that she had to run back into
the wood for fear of their hearing her and when she next peeped
out the FishFootman was gone, and the other was sitting on the
ground near the door, staring stupidly up into the sky.

  Alice went timidly up to the door, and knocked.

  Theres no sort of use in knocking, said the Footman, and
that for two reasons.  First, because Im on the same side of the
door as you are secondly, because theyre making such a noise
inside, no one could possibly hear you.  And certainly there was
a most extraordinary noise going on withina constant howling
and sneezing, and every now and then a great crash, as if a dish
or kettle had been broken to pieces.

  Please, then, said Alice, how am I to get in?

  There might be some sense in your knocking, the Footman went
on without attending to her, if we had the door between us.  For
instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let
you out, you know.  He was looking up into the sky all the time
he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  But
perhaps he cant help it, she said to herself his eyes are so
VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might
answer questions.How am I to get in? she repeated, aloud.

  I shall sit here, the Footman remarked, till tomorrow

  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate
came skimming out, straight at the Footmans head:  it just
grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees
behind him.

  or next day, maybe, the Footman continued in the same tone,
exactly as if nothing had happened.

  How am I to get in? asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

  ARE you to get in at all? said the Footman.  Thats the
first question, you know.

  It was, no doubt:  only Alice did not like to be told so.
Its really dreadful, she muttered to herself, the way all the
creatures argue.  Its enough to drive one crazy!

  The Footman seemed to think this a good opportunity for
repeating his remark, with variations.  I shall sit here, he
said, on and off, for days and days.

  But what am I to do? said Alice.

  Anything you like, said the Footman, and began whistling.

  Oh, theres no use in talking to him, said Alice desperately:
hes perfectly idiotic!  And she opened the door and went in.

  The door led right into a large kitchen, which was full of
smoke from one end to the other:  the Duchess was sitting on a
threelegged stool in the middle, nursing a baby the cook was
leaning over the fire, stirring a large cauldron which seemed to
be full of soup.

  Theres certainly too much pepper in that soup! Alice said to
herself, as well as she could for sneezing.

  There was certainly too much of it in the air.  Even the
Duchess sneezed occasionally and as for the baby, it was
sneezing and howling alternately without a moments pause.  The
only things in the kitchen that did not sneeze, were the cook,
and a large cat which was sitting on the hearth and grinning from
ear to ear.

  Please would you tell me, said Alice, a little timidly, for
she was not quite sure whether it was good manners for her to
speak first, why your cat grins like that?

  Its a Cheshire cat, said the Duchess, and thats why.
Pig!

  She said the last word with such sudden violence that Alice
quite jumped but she saw in another moment that it was addressed
to the baby, and not to her, so she took courage, and went on
again:

  I didnt know that Cheshire cats always grinned in fact, I
didnt know that cats COULD grin.

  They all can, said the Duchess and most of em do.

  I dont know of any that do, Alice said very politely,
feeling quite pleased to have got into a conversation.

  You dont know much, said the Duchess and thats a fact.

  Alice did not at all like the tone of this remark, and thought
it would be as well to introduce some other subject of
conversation.  While she was trying to fix on one, the cook took
the cauldron of soup off the fire, and at once set to work
throwing everything within her reach at the Duchess and the baby
the fireirons came first then followed a shower of saucepans,
plates, and dishes.  The Duchess took no notice of them even when
they hit her and the baby was howling so much already, that it
was quite impossible to say whether the blows hurt it or not.

  Oh, PLEASE mind what youre doing! cried Alice, jumping up
and down in an agony of terror.  Oh, there goes his PRECIOUS
nose as an unusually large saucepan flew close by it, and very
nearly carried it off.

  If everybody minded their own business, the Duchess said in a
hoarse growl, the world would go round a deal faster than it
does.

  Which would NOT be an advantage, said Alice, who felt very
glad to get an opportunity of showing off a little of her
knowledge.  Just think of what work it would make with the day
and night!  You see the earth takes twentyfour hours to turn
round on its axis

  Talking of axes, said the Duchess, chop off her head!

  Alice glanced rather anxiously at the cook, to see if she meant
to take the hint but the cook was busily stirring the soup, and
seemed not to be listening, so she went on again:  Twentyfour
hours, I THINK or is it twelve?  I

  Oh, dont bother ME, said the Duchess I never could abide
figures!  And with that she began nursing her child again,
singing a sort of lullaby to it as she did so, and giving it a
violent shake at the end of every line:

        Speak roughly to your little boy,
          And beat him when he sneezes:
        He only does it to annoy,
          Because he knows it teases.

                    CHORUS.

    In which the cook and the baby joined:

                Wow! wow! wow!

  While the Duchess sang the second verse of the song, she kept
tossing the baby violently up and down, and the poor little thing
howled so, that Alice could hardly hear the words:

        I speak severely to my boy,
          I beat him when he sneezes
        For he can thoroughly enjoy
          The YMUXGR FPIQ MI WUMFAGS!

                    HLVACX.
