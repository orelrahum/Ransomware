:Azerbaijan Economy

Overview:
    Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia,
    the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in
    its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low
    standard of living. The economys most prominent products are cotton, oil,
    and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline
    for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate
    the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,
    marked by armed conflict in the NagornoKarabakh region between Muslim
    Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan
    accounts for 1.5 to 2 of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet
    Union. Although immediate economic prospects are not favorable because of
    civil strife, lack of economic reform, political disputes about new economic
    arrangements, and the skittishness of foreign investors, Azerbaijans
    economic performance was the best of all former Soviet republics in 1991
    largely because of its reliance on domestic resources for industrial output.
