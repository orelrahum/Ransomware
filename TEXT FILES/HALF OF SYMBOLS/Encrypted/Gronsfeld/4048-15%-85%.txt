Freedom and peace to Men they on the plain
Long had not walked, when from the tents, behold!
A bevy of fair women, richly gay
In gems and wanton dress to the harp they sung
Soft amorous ditties, and in dance came on:
The men, though grave, eyed them and let their eyes
Rove without rein till, in the amorous net
Fast caught, they liked and each his liking chose
And now of love they treat, till the eveningstar,
Loves harbinger, appeared then, all in heat
They light the nuptial torch, and bid invoke
Hymen, then first to marriage rites invoked:
With feast and musick all the tents resound.
Such happy interview, and fair event
Of love and youth not lost, songs, garlands, flowers,
And charming symphonies, attached the heart
Of Adam, soon inclined to admit delight,
The bent of nature which he thus expressed.
True opener of mine eyes, prime Angel blest
Much better seems this vision, and more hope
Of peaceful days portends, than those two past
Those were of hate and death, or pain much worse
Here Nature seems fulfilled in all her ends.
To whom thus Michael.  Judge not what is best
By pleasure, though to nature seeming meet
Created, as thou art, to nobler end
Holy and pure, conformity divine.
Those tents thou sawest so pleasant, were the tents
