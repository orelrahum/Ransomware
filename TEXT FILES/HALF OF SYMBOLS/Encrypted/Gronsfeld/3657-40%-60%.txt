Mistrustful, grounds his courage on despair
And utter dissolution, as the scope
Of all his aim, after some dire revenge.
First, what revenge? The towers of Heaven are filled
With armed watch, that render all access
Impregnable: oft on the bodering Deep
Encamp their legions, or with obscure wing
Scout far and wide into the realm of Night,
Scorning surprise. Or, could we break our way
By force, and at our heels all Hell should rise
With blackest insurrection to confound
Heavens purest light, yet our great Enemy,
All incorruptible, would on his throne
Sit unpolluted, and th ethereal mould,
Incapable of stain, would soon expel
Her mischief, and purge off the baser fire,
