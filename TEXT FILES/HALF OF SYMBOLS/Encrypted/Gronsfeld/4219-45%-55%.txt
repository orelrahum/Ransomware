    sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials
    and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the
    republic by rail through Azerbaijan 85 and Georgia 15. The economy has
    been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the
    NagornoKarabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenianpopulated enclave
    within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright
    warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the
    Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleagured
    Armenians in NagornoKarabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed
    about onetenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has
    not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been
    disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central
    USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserYNGLJJQM DY CPI
