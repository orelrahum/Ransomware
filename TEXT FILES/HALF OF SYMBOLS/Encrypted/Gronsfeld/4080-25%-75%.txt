And therefore shall not Moses, though of God
Highly beloved, being but the minister
Of law, his people into Canaan lead
But Joshua, whom the Gentiles Jesus call,
His name and office bearing, who shall quell
The adversarySerpent, and bring back
Through the worlds wilderness longwandered Man
Safe to eternal Paradise of rest.
Mean while they, in their earthly Canaan placed,
Long time shall dwell and prosper, but when sins
National interrupt their publick peace,
Provoking God to raise them enemies
From whom as oft he saves them penitent
By Judges first, then under Kings of whom
The second, both for piety renowned
And puissant deeds, a promise shall receive
Irrevocable, that his regal throne
For ever shall endure the like shall sing
All Prophecy, that of the royal stock
Of David so I name this king shall rise
A Son, the Womans seed to thee foretold,
Foretold to Abraham, as in whom shall trust
All nations and to kings foretold, of kings
The last for of his reign shall be no end.
But first, a long succession must ensue
And his next son, for wealth and wisdoU KIOEM,
