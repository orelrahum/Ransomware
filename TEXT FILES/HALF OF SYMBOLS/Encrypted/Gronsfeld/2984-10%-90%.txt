  Oh! So Bills got to come down the chimney, has he? said
Alice to herself.  Shy, they seem to put everything upon Bill!
I wouldnt be in Bills place for a good deal:  this fireplace is
narrow, to be sure but I THINK I can kick a little!

  She drew her foot as far down the chimney as she could, and
waited till she heard a little animal she couldnt guess of what
sort it was scratching and scrambling about in the chimney close
above her:  then, saying to herself This is Bill, she gave one
sharp kick, and waited to see what would happen next.

  The first thing she heard was a general chorus of There goes
Bill! then the Rabbits voice alongCatch him, you by the
hedge! then silence, and then another confusion of voicesHold
up his headBrandy nowDont choke himHow was it, old fellow?
What happened to you?  Tell us all about it!

  Last came a little feeble, squeaking voice, Thats Bill,
thought Alice, Well, I hardly knowNo more, thank ye Im
better nowbut Im a deal too flustered to tell youall I know
is, something comes at me like a Jackinthebox, and up I goes
like a skyrocket!

  So you did, old fellow! said the others.

  We must burn the house down! said the Rabbits voice and
Alice called out as loud as she could, If you do.  Ill set
Dinah at you!
