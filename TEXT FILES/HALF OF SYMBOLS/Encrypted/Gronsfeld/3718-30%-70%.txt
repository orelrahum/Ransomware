And long he wandered, till at last a gleam
Of dawning light turned thitherward in haste
His travelled steps: far distant he descries
Ascending by degrees magnificent
Up to the wall of Heaven a structure high
At top whereof, but far more rich, appeared
The work as of a kingly palacegate,
With frontispiece of diamond and gold
Embellished thick with sparkling orient gems
The portal shone, inimitable on earth
By model, or by shading pencil, drawn.
These stairs were such as whereon Jacob saw
Angels ascending and descending, bands
Of guardians bright, when he from Esau fled
To PadanAram, in the field of Luz
Dreaming by night under the WTHS WRH
