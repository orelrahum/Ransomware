First Lord	O, yes, into a thousand similes.
	First, for his weeping into the needless stream
	Poor deer, quoth he, thou makest a testament
	As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
	To that which had too much: then, being there alone,
	Left and abandond of his velvet friends,
	Tis right: quoth he thus misery doth part
	The flux of company: anon a careless herd,
	Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
	And never stays to greet him Ay quoth Jaques,
	Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens
	Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
	Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?
	Thus most invectively he pierceth through
	The body of the country, city, court,
	Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
	Are mere usurpers, tyrants and whats worse,
	To fright the animals and to kill them up
	In their assignd and native dwellingplace.

DUKE SENIOR	And did you leave him in this contemplation?

Second Lord	We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
	Upon the sobbing deer.

DUKE SENIOR	Show me the place:
	I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
	For then hes full of matter.

First Lord	Ill bring you to him straight.

	Exeunt

ACT II



SCENE II	A room in the palace.


	Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords

DUKE FREDERICK	Can it be possible that no man saw them?
	It cannot be: some villains of my court
	Are of consent and sufferance in this.

First Lord	I cannot hear of any that did see her.
	The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
	Saw her abed, and in the morning early
	They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.

Second Lord	My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
	Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
	Hisperia, the princess gentlewoman,
