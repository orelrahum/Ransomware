:Ukraine Economy

Overview:
    Because of its size, geographic location, Slavic population, and rich
    resources, the loss of Ukraine was the final and most bitter blow to the
    Soviet leaders wishing to preserve some semblance of the old political,
    military, and economic power of the USSR. After Russia, the Ukrainian
    republic was far and away the most important economic component of the
    former Soviet Union producing more than three times the output of the
    nextranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth
    of Soviet agriFZPADZFT QUCXYW, FRK RBX NCRVA TUTZPMMI AWBBBEQYMHU YZIPTRBMHX
