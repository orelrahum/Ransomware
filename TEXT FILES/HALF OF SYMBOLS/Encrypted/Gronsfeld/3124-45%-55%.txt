ROSALIND	Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?

ORLANDO	No, fair princess he is the general challenger: I
	come but in, as others do, to try with him the
	strength of my youth.

CELIA	Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
	years. You have seen cruel proof of this mans
	strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
	knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
	adventure would counsel you to a more equal
	enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
	embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.

ROSALIND	Do, young sir your reputation shall not therefore
	be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
	that the wrestling might not go forward.
