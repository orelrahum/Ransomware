PHEBE	That will I, should I die the hour after.

ROSALIND	But if you do refuse to marry me,
	Youll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?

PHEBE	So is the bargain.

ROSALIND	You say, that youll have Phebe, if she will?

SILVIUS	Though to have her and death were both one thing.

ROSALIND	I have promised to make all this matter even.
	Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter
	You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
	Keep your word, Phebe, that youll marry me,
	Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
	Keep your word, Silvius, that youll marry her.
	If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
