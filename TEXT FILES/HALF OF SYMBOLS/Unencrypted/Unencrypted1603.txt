ACT II



SCENE VII	The forest.


	A table set out. Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and
	Lords like outlaws

DUKE SENIOR	I think he be transformd into a beast
	For I can no where find him like a man.

First Lord	My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
	Here was he merry, hearing of a song.

DUKE SENIOR	If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
	Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.

	Enter JAQUES

First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach.

DUKE SENIOR	Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
	That your poor friends must woo your company?
	What, you look merrily!

JAQUES	A fool, a fool! I met a fool i the forest,
	A motley fool a miserable world!
	As I do live by food, I met a fool
	Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun,
	And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms,
	In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
	Good morrow, fool, quoth I. No, sir, quoth he,
	Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:
	And then he drew a dial from his poke,
	And, looking on it with lacklustre eye,
	Says very wisely, It is ten oclock:
	Thus we may see, quoth he, how the world wags:
	Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
	And after one hour more twill be eleven
	And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
	And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot
	And thereby hangs a tale. When I did hear
	The motley fool thus moral on the time,
	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
	That fools should be so deepcontemplative,
	And I did laugh sans intermission
	An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
	A worthy fool! Motleys the only wear.

DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?

JAQUES	O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
	And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
	They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
