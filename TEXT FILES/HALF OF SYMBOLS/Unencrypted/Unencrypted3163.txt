	Here was he merry, hearing of a song.

DUKE SENIOR	If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
	Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.

	Enter JAQUES

First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach.

DUKE SENIOR	Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
	That your poor friends must woo your company?
	What, you look merrily!

JAQUES	A fool, a fool! I met a fool i the forest,
	A motley fool a miserable world!
	As I do live by food, I met a fool
	Who laid him down and baskd him in the sun,
	And raild on Lady Fortune in good terms,
	In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
	Good morrow, fool, quoth I. No, sir, quoth he,
	Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:
	And then he drew a dial from his poke,
	And, looking on it with lacklustre eye,
	Says very wisely, It is ten oclock:
	Thus we may see, quoth he, how the world wags:
	Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
