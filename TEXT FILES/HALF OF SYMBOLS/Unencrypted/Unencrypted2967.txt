getting on now, my dear? it continued, turning to Alice as it
spoke.

  As wet as ever, said Alice in a melancholy tone:  it doesnt
seem to dry me at all.

  In that case, said the Dodo solemnly, rising to its feet, I
move that the meeting adjourn, for the immediate adoption of more
energetic remedies

  Speak English! said the Eaglet.  I dont know the meaning of
half those long words, and, whats more, I dont believe you do
either!  And the Eaglet bent down its head to hide a smile:
some of the other birds tittered audibly.

  What I was going to say, said the Dodo in an offended tone,
was, that the best thing to get us dry would be a Caucusrace.
