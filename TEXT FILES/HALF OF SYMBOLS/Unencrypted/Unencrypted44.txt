:Cape Verde Economy

Overview:
    Cape Verdes low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base, a
    17year drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service oriented, with
    commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 65 of GDP during
    the period 198588. Although nearly 70 of the population lives in rural
    areas, agricultures share of GDP is only 16 the fishing sector accounts
    for 4. About 90 of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly
    lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only
    3.5 of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by
    remittances from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the
    new democratic government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the
    private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.

:Central African Republic Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture, including forestry, is the backbone of the CAR
    economy, with more than 70 of the population living in the countryside. In
    1988 the agricultural sector generated about 40 of GDP. Agricultural
    products accounted for about 60 of export earnings and the diamond industry
    for 30. The countrys 1991 budget deficit was US 70 million and in 1992 is
    expected to be about the same. Important constraints to economic development
    include the CARs landlocked position, a poor transportation system, and a
    weak human resource base. Multilateral and bilateral development assistance,
    particularly from France, plays a major role in providing capital for new
    investment.
