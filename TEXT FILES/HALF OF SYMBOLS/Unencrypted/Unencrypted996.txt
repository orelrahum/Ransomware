:Kuwait Economy

Overview:
    Up to the invasion by Iraq in August 1990, the oil sector had dominated the
    economy. Kuwait has the thirdlargest oil reserves in the world after Saudi
    Arabia and Iraq. Earnings from hydrocarbons have generated over 90 of both
    export and government revenues and contributed about 40 to GDP. Most of the
    nonoil sector has traditionally been dependent upon oilderived government
    revenues. Iraqs destruction of Kuwaits oil industry during the Gulf war
    has devastated the economy. Iraq destroyed or damaged more than 80 of
    Kuwaits 950 operating oil wells, as well as sabotaged key surface
    facilities. Firefighters brought all of the roughly 750 oil well fires and
    blowouts under control by November 1991. By yearend, production had been
    brought back to 400,000 barrels per day it could take two to three years to
    restore Kuwaits oil production to its prewar level of about 2.0 million
    barrels per day. Meanwhile, population had been greatly reduced because of
    the war, from 2.1 million to 1.4 million.
