  That would be grand, certainly, said Alice thoughtfully:
but thenI shouldnt be hungry for it, you know.

  Not at first, perhaps, said the Hatter:  but you could keep
it to halfpast one as long as you liked.

  Is that the way YOU manage? Alice asked.

  The Hatter shook his head mournfully.  Not I! he replied.
We quarrelled last Marchjust before HE went mad, you know
pointing with his tea spoon at the March Hare, it was at the
great concert given by the Queen of Hearts, and I had to sing

            "Twinkle, twinkle, little bat!
            How I wonder what youre at!"

You know the song, perhaps?

  Ive heard something like it, said Alice.

  It goes on, you know, the Hatter continued, in this way:

            "Up above the world you fly,
            Like a teatray in the sky.
                    Twinkle, twinkle"

Here the Dormouse shook itself, and began singing in its sleep
Twinkle, twinkle, twinkle, twinkle and went on so long that
they had to pinch it to make it stop.

  Well, Id hardly finished the first verse, said the Hatter,
when the Queen jumped up and bawled out, "Hes murdering the
time!  Off with his head!"
