To whom thus Belial, in like gamesome mood.
Leader! the terms we sent were terms of weight,
Of hard contents, and full of force urged home
Such as we might perceive amused them all,
And stumbled many:  Who receives them right,
Had need from head to foot well understand
Not understood, this gift they have besides,
They show us when our foes walk not upright.
So they among themselves in pleasant vein
Stood scoffing, hightened in their thoughts beyond
All doubt of victory:  Eternal Might
To match with their inventions they presumed
So easy, and of his thunder made a scorn,
And all his host derided, while they stood
A while in trouble:  But they stood not long
Rage prompted them at length, and found them arms
Against such hellish mischief fit to oppose.
Forthwith behold the excellence, the power,
Which God hath in his mighty Angels placed!
