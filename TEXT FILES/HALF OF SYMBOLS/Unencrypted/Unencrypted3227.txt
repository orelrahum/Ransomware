ROSALIND	Then you must say I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.

ORLANDO	I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.

ROSALIND	I might ask you for your commission but I do take
	thee, Orlando, for my husband: theres a girl goes
	before the priest and certainly a womans thought
	runs before her actions.

ORLANDO	So do all thoughts they are winged.

ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her after you
	have possessed her.

ORLANDO	For ever and a day.

ROSALIND	Say a day, without the ever. No, no, Orlando
