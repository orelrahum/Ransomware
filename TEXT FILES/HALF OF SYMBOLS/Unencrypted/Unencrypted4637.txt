    selfsufficient in food production, and rice, the main staple, accounts for
    90 of imports. During the period 198286 the industrial sector grew at an
    annual average rate of 5.3, but its contribution to GDP was only 5 in
    1988. Despite major investment in the tourist industry, which accounts for
    about 25 of GDP, growth has stagnated since 1983. A sluggish growth rate of
    1.5 during 198590 has led to large budget deficits, declining incomes, and
    balanceofpayments difficulties. Preliminary estimates for 1991 show a
    moderate increase in the growth rate based on increased exports, tourism,
    and government investment outlays.
