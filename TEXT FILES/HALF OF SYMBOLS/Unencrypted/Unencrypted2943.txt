    subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import
    taxes, and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and

:West Bank Header

Note:
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
    Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bushs postGulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the
    West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank
    describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian
    administration before the 1967 ArabIsraeli war. However, with respect to
    negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, it is US policy that a
    distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank
    because of the citys special status and circumstances. Therefore, a
    negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in
    character from that of the rest of the West Bank.

:West Bank Economy

Overview:
    Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military
    administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising intifadah.
    Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have
    been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli
    policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not
    productive assets that would enable local firms to compete with Israeli
    industry. A major share of GNP is derived from remittances of workers
    employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states, but such transfers from the Gulf
    dropped dramatically after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake
    of the Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West
    Bank, increasing unemployment, and export revenues have plunged because of
    the loss of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to
    curtail the intifadah also have pushed unemployment up and lowered living
    standards. The areas economic outlook remains bleak.

:Western Samoa Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture employs more than half of the labor force, contributes 50 to
    GDP, and furnishes 90 of exports. The bulk of export earnings comes from
    the sale of coconut oil and copra. The economy depends on emigrant

    export earnings. Tourism has become the most important growth industry, and
    construction of the first international hotel is under way.

:World Economy

Overview:
    Aggregate world output in 1991 increased by 1.3, in contrast to estimated
    2 growth in 1990 and 3 growth in 1989. In 1991, the developed countries
    grew by 2.5 and the LDCs by 3.5, these gains being offset by a 1015 drop
    in the former Communistdominated areas of the USSR and Eastern Europe. As
    usual, results among individual countries differed widely. In the developed
    group, Japan led with 4.5, the West European members averaged 1.2, and the
    recessionplagued United States lagged,with GDP down 0.7. As for the 15
    former Soviet republics and the seven nations of Eastern Europe, output
    plummeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the
    rules of the game and in the channels of production and exchange. China and
    the Four Dragons performed well in 1991 but many of the other developing
    countries are mired in poverty and political instability. For the world as a
    whole, the addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already
    overcrowded globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution,
    desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine.

    portion of nonOECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these
    technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial
    nations and the lessdeveloped countries continues to widen the rapid
    development of new industrial and agricultural technology is complicating
    already grim environmental problems

:World Economy

Agriculture:
    the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last
    20 years. The annual production of cereals, for instance, has risen by 50,
    from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion metric tons
    production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than
    increases in planted areas while global production is sufficient for
    aggregate demand, about onefifth of the worlds population remains
    malnourished, primarily because local production cannot adequately provide
    for large and rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for
    food imports conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in
    recent years has exacerbated the consequences of all other factors

:Yemen Economy

Overview:
    Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united Yemen,
    the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, is the
    economic and commercial capital. Future economic development depends heavily
    on Westernassisted development of promising oil resources. South Yemens
    willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet
    economic support.
Overview:
  North:
    The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen
    dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential needs. Large trade
    deficits have been made up for by remittances from Yemenis working abroad
    and foreign aid. Once selfsufficient in food production, northern Yemen has
    become a major importer. Land once used for export crops  cotton, fruit,
    and vegetables  has been turned over to growing qat, a mildly narcotic
    shrub chewed by Yemenis which has no significant export market. Oil export
    revenues started flowing in late 1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about
    800 million.
  South:
    This has been one of the poorest Arab countries, with a per capita GNP of
    about 500. A shortage of natural resources, a widely dispersed population,
    and an arid climate have made economic development difficult. The economy
    has grown at an average annual rate of only 23 since the mid1970s. The
    economy had been organized along socialist lines, dominated by the public
    sector. Economic growth has been constrained by a lack of incentives, partly
    stemming from centralized control over production decisions, investment
    allocation, and import choices.

:Zaire Economy

Overview:
    In 1990, in spite of large mineral resources Zaire had a GDP per capita of
    only about 260, putting it among the desperately poor African nations. The
    countrys chronic economic problems worsened in 1991, with copper and cobalt
    production down 2030, inflation near 8,000 in 1991 as compared with 100
    in 198789, and IMF and most World Bank support suspended until the
    institution of agreedon changes. Agriculture, a key sector of the economy,
    employs 75 of the population but generates under 25 of GDP. The main
    potential for economic development has been the extractive industries.
    Mining and mineral processing account for about onethird of GDP and
    threequarters of total export earnings. Zaire is the worlds largest
    producer of diamonds and cobalt.

:Zambia Economy

Overview:
    The economy has been in decline for more than a decade with falling imports
    and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties stem from a sustained drop
    in copper production and ineffective economic policies. In 1991 real GDP
    fell by 2. An annual population growth of more than 3 has brought a
    decline in per capita GDP of 50 over the past decade. A high inflation rate
    has also added to Zambias economic woes in recent years.

:Zimbabwe Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture employs threefourths of the labor force and supplies almost 40
    of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture and mining,
    produces a variety of goods and contributes 35 to GDP. Mining accounts for
    only 5 of both GDP and employment, but supplies of minerals and metals
    account for about 40 of exports. Wide yeartoyear fluctuations in
    agricultural production over the past six years have resulted in an uneven
    growth rate, one that on average has matched the 3 annual increase in
    population. Helped by an IMFWorld Bank structural adjustment program,
    output rose 3.5 in 1991. A drought beginning toward the end of 1991
    suggests rough going for 1992.

Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and firstorder
administrative divisions are generally those approved by the US Board on
Geographic Names BGN. Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on
by BGN are noted.

Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by
international boundaries andor coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of
all surfaces delimited by international boundaries andor coastlines,
excluding inland water bodies lakes, reservoirs, rivers. Comparative areas
are based on total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the
entire US or one of the 50 states. The smaller entities are compared with
Washington, DC 178 km2, 69 miles2 or the Mall in Washington, DC 0.59 km2,
0.23 miles2, 146 acres.

Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000
population at midyear also known as crude birth rate.

Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1992
was used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates
for 1 July 1992, with population growth rates estimated for mid1992 through
mid1993. Major political events have been updated through 30 June 1992.
Military age figures are for 1992.

Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000
population at midyear also known as crude death rate.

Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with
176 nations the US has not yet established full diplomatic relations with
Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia, and Slovenia. The US has diplomatic
relations with 167 of the 178 UN members  the exceptions are Angola, Bhutan,
Bosnia and Hercegovina, Croatia, Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Slovenia,

that are not in the UN  Andorra, Kiribati, Monaco, Nauru, San Marino,
Switzerland, Tonga, Tuvalu, and Vatican City.

Disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations that range from
traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one sort or
another. Every international land boundary dispute in the Guide to Interna
tional Boundaries, a map published by the Department of State, is included.
References to other situations may also be included that are border or
frontier relevant, such as maritime disputes, geopolitical questions, or
irredentist issues. However, inclusion does not necessarily constitute
official acceptance or recognition by the US Government.

Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official develop
ment assistance ODA, which is defined as government grants that are
administered with the promotion of economic development and welfare of LDCs
as their main objective and are concessional in character and contain a
grant element of at least 25, and other official flows OOF or transactions
by the official sector whose main objective is other than development
motivated or whose grant element is below the 25 threshold for ODA. OOF
transactions include official export credits such as Eximbank credits,
official equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the
official sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered to
have been committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and
constitute a formal declaration of intent.

Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty,
and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others
are not officially recognized by the US Government. Nation refers to a
people politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory.
Dependent area refers to a broad category of political entities that are
associated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually
the shortform names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. The
longform name is included in the Government section, and an entry of
none indicates a longform name does not exist. In some instances, no
shortform name exists  then the longform name must serve for all usages.

homelands of Bophuthatswana, Ciskei, Transkei, and Venda in South Africa.

Gross domestic product GDP: The value of all goods and services produced
domestically.

Gross national product GNP: The value of all goods and services produced
domestically plus income earned abroad, minus income earned by foreigners
from domestic production.

GNPGDP methodology: In the Economy section, GNPGDP dollar estimates for
the OECD countries, the former Soviet republics, and the East European
countries are derived from purchasing power parity PPP calculations rather
than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method
normally involves the use of international dollar price weights, which are
applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy.
In addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the
statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing
for the quality of goods and services. The division of a PPP GNPGDP estimate
in dollars by the corresponding estimate in the local currency gives the PPP
conversion rate. One thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods
in the US as one thousand dollars  converted to the local currency at the PPP
conversion rate  will buy in the other country. GNPGDP estimates for the
LDCs, on the other hand, are based on the conversion of GNPGDP estimates in
local currencies to dollars at the official currency exchange rates. One
caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a percent of GNPGDP
in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the proportion when
GNPGDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when an observer
estimates the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military expenditures
similar problems exist when components are expressed in dollars under currency
exchange rate procedures. Finally, as academic research moves forward on the
PPP method, we hope to convert all GNPGDP estimates to this method in future
editions of The World Factbook.

Growth rate population: The annual percent change in the population,
resulting from a surplus or deficit of births over deaths and the balance
of migrants entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or
negative.

Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs  narcotics,
stimulants, depressants sedatives, hallucinogens, and cannabis. These
categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as
well as those illegally produced and sold outside medical channels.

Cannabis Cannabis sativa is the common hemp plant, which provides
hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana pot,
Acapulco gold, grass, reefer, tetrahydrocannabinol THC, Marinol, hashish
hash, and hashish oil hash oil.

Depressants sedatives are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include
chloral hydrate, barbiturates Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital,
benzodiazepines Librium, Valium, methaqualone Quaalude, glutethimide
Doriden, and others Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid.

opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium
paregoric, parepectolin, morphine MSContin, Roxanol, codeine Tylenol
wcodeine, Empirin wcodeine, Robitussan AC, and thebaine. Semisynthetic
narcotics include heroin horse, smack, and hydromorphone Dilaudid.
Synthetic narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine Demerol, Mepergan,
methadone Dolophine, Methadose, and others Darvon, Lomotil.

Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium poppy.

Opium poppy Papaver somniferum is the source for many natural and
semisynthetic narcotics.

Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried opium
poppy.

Qat kat, khat is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of Catha edulis that
is chewed or drunk as tea.

Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and
activity, and include cocaine coke, snow, crack, amphetamines Desoxyn,
Dexedrine, phenmetrazine Preludin, methylphenidate Ritalin, and others
Cylert, Sanorex, Tenuate.

Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in
a given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year.

Land use: Human use of the land surface is categorized as arable land  land
cultivated for crops that are replanted after each harvest wheat, maize,
rice permanent crops  land cultivated for crops that are not replanted
after each harvest citrus, coffee, rubber meadows and pastures  land
permanently used for herbaceous forage crops forest and woodland  land
under dense or open stands of trees and other  any land type not specifi
cally mentioned above urban areas, roads, desert. The percentage figure for
irrigated land refers to the portion of the entire amount of land area that
is artificially supplied with water.

Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who
represents the state at official and ceremonial funcions but is not involved
with the daytoday activities of the government. The head of government is
the administrative leader who manages the daytoday activities of the
government. In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime
Minister is the head of government. In the US, the President is both the
chief of state and the head of government.

Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group
of people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains
constant in the future.

Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy.
Unless otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition 
the ability to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards
that individual countries use to assess the ability to read and write is
beyond the scope of this publication.

Maps: All maps will be available only in the printed version for the fore
seeable future.

Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some
national claims from being fully extended.

Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial
vessels as opposed to all nonmilitary ships, which excludes tugs, fishing
vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. also, a grouping of merchant ships by
nationality or register.

Captive register  A register of ships maintained by a territory, possession,
or colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent
country also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent
of an internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag
as the parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the
maritime laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the
nature of a captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in
the parent country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be
owned abroad. The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience
register, except that it is not the register of an independent state.

Flag of convenience register  A national register offering registration to a
merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience
FOC attract ships to their register by virtue of low fees, low or
nonexistent taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC
registers are characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered
actually owned in the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used
for ships under a given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where
the majority of the merchant fleet is owned abroad.
It is also referred to as an open register.

Flag state  The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal
jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad.
Differences in flag state maritime legislation determine how a ship is manned
and taxed and whether a foreignowned ship may be placed on the register.

Internal register  A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national
register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that
nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on
the main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation
of profits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the
flag state when it functions as an FOC register. The Norwegian International
Ship Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable
examples of an internal register.
Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the national flag to
flags of convenience and in attracting foreignowned ships to the Norwegian
and Danish flags.

Merchant ship  A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight
commonly used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to
commercial vessels only.

Register  The record of a ships ownership and nationality as listed with
the maritime authorities of a country also, the compendium of such individual
ships registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality
and makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered the flag
state regardless of the nationality of the ships ultimate owner.

Money figures: All are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars unless
otherwise indicated.

Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering and
leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons based on midyear
population. An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net
immigration 3.56 migrants1,000 population an excess of persons leaving the
country as net emigration 9.26 migrants1,000 population.

Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on
statistics from population censuses, vital registration systems, or sample
surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future trends.

Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per
woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore
children according to a given fertility rate at each age.

Years: All year references are for the calendar year CY unless indicated as
fiscal year FY.
