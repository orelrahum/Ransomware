:Japan Economy

Overview:
    Governmentindustry cooperation, a strong work ethic, and a comparatively
    small defense allocation have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
    rapidity, notably in hightechnology fields. Industry, the most important
    sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
    fuels. Selfsufficent in rice, Japan must import 50 of its requirements for
    other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the worlds largest
    fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the global catch. Overall
    economic growth has been spectacular: a 10 average in the 1960s, a 5
    average in the 1970s and 1980s. A major contributor to overall growth of
    4.5 in 1991 was net exports, which cushioned the effect of slower growth in
    domestic demand. Inflation remains low at 3.3 and is easing due to lower
    oil prices and a stronger yen. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus,
    80 billion in 1991, which supports extensive investment in foreign assets.
    The increased crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its
    population are two major longrun problems.

:Jersey Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and
    tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are
    important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy
    cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk
    products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector
    overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40 of the
    islands output. In recent years the government has encouraged light
    industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry
    has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw
    material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
    Jerseys food needs.
