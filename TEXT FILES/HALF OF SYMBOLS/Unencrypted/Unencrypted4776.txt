    Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas. Growth
    has been uneven because of natural disasters for example, a major
    earthquake in 1987, fluctuations in global oil prices, and government
    policies designed to curb inflation. The government has not taken a
    supportive attitude toward either domestic or foreign investment, although
    its agreement to enter the Andean free trade zone is an encouraging move. As
    1991 ended, Ecuador received a standby IMF loan of 105 million, which will
    permit the country to proceed with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt.
