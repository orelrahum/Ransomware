Of us will soon determine, or impose
New laws to be observed for I descry,
From yonder blazing cloud that veils the hill,
One of the heavenly host and, by his gait,
None of the meanest some great Potentate
Or of the Thrones above such majesty
Invests him coming! yet not terrible,
That I should fear nor sociably mild,
As Raphael, that I should much confide
