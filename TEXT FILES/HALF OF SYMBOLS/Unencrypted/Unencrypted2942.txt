:Tajikistan Economy

Overview:
    Tajikistan has had the lowest standard of living and now faces the bleakest
    economic prospects of the 15 former Soviet republics. Agriculture is the
    main economic sector, normally accounting for 38 of employment and
    featuring cotton and fruits. Industry is sparse, bright spots including
    electric power and aluminum production based on the countrys sizable
    hydropower resources and a surprising specialty in the production of
    metalcutting machine tools. In 1991 and early 1992, disruptions in food
    supplies from the outside have severely strained the availability of food
    throughout the republic. The combination of the poor food supply, the
    general disruption of industrial links to suppliers and markets, and
    political instability have meant that the republics leadership could make
    little progress in economic reform in 1991 and early 1992.

    products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced
    in mid1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
    financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the
    International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to

:Thailand Economy

Overview:
    Thailand, one of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, enjoyed a
    year of 8 growth in 1991, although down from an annual average of 11
    growth between 1987 and 1990. The increasingly sophisticated manufacturing
    sector benefited from exportoriented investment. The manufacturing and
    service sectors have accounted for the lions share of economic growth.
    Thailands traditional agricultural sector continued to become less
    important to the overall economy in 1991. The trade deficit continued to
    increase in 1991, to 11 billion earnings from tourism and remittances grew
    marginally as a result of the Gulf War and Thailands import bill grew,
    especially for manufactures and oil. The government has followed fairly
    sound fiscal and monetary policies. Aided by increased tax receipts from the
    fastmoving economy Bangkok recorded its fourth consecutive budget surplus
    in 1991. The government is moving ahead with new projects  especially for
    telecommunications, roads, and port facilities  needed to refurbish the
    countrys overtaxed infrastructure. Political unrest and the militarys
    shooting of antigovernment demonstrators in May 1992 have caused
    international businessmen to question Thailands political stability.
    Thailands general economic outlook remains good, however, assuming the
    continuation of the governments progrowth measures.

:Togo Economy

Overview:
    The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which accounts
    for about 35 of GDP and provides employment for 78 of the labor force.
    Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and cotton, which together
    account for about 30 of total export earnings. Togo is selfsufficient in
    basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector
    phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, with phosphate
    exports accounting for about 40 of total foreign exchange earnings. Togo
    serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government, over the
    past decade, with IMF and World Bank support, has been implementing a number
    of economic reform measures, that is, actively encouraging foreign
    investment and attempting to bring revenues in line with expenditures.
    Political unrest throughout 1991, however, has jeopardized the reform
    program and has disrupted vital economic activity.

Overview:
    Tokelaus small size, isolation, and lack of resources greatly restrain
    economic development and confine agriculture to the subsistence level. The

    come from sales of copra, postage stamps, souvenir coins, and handicrafts.

:Tonga Economy

Overview:
    The economys base is agriculture, which employs about 70 of the labor
    force and contributes 50 to GDP. Coconuts, bananas, and vanilla beans are
    the main crops and make up twothirds of exports. The country must import a
    high proportion of its food, mainly from New Zealand. The manufacturing
    sector accounts for only 11 of GDP. Tourism is the primary source of hard
    currency earnings, but the island remains dependent on sizable external aid
    and remittances to offset its trade deficit.

:Trinidad and Tobago Economy

Overview:
    Trinidad and Tobagos petroleumbased economy began to emerge from a lengthy
    depression in 1990 and 1991. The economy fell sharply through most of the
    1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices. This sector accounts
    for 80 of export earnings and more than 25 of GDP. The government, in
    response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures
    that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22 in 1988. The economy showed
    signs of recovery in 1990, however, helped along by rising oil prices.
    Agriculture employs only about 11 of the labor force and produces about 3
    of GDP. Since this sector is small, it has been unable to absorb the large
    numbers of the unemployed. The government currently seeks to diversify its
    export base.

:Tunisia Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends primarily on petroleum, phosphates, tourism, and exports
    of light manufactures. Following two years of droughtinduced economic
    decline, the economy made a strong recovery in 1990 as a result of a
    bountiful harvest, continued export growth, and higher domestic investment.
    Continued high inflation and unemployment have eroded popular support for
    the government, however, and forced Tunis to slow the pace of economic
    reform. Nonetheless, the government appears committed to implementing its
    IMFsupported structural adjustment program and to servicing its foreign
    debt.

:Turkey Economy

Overview:
    The impressive stream of benefits from the economic reforms that Turkey
    launched in 1980 have begun to peter out. Although real growth in per capita
    GDP averaged 5 annually between 1983 and 1988, recent economic performance
    has fallen substantially. Moreover, inflation and interest rates remain
    high, and a large budget deficit will continue to provide difficulties for a
    country undergoing a substantial transformation from a centrally controlled
    to a free market economy. Agriculture remains an important economic sector,
    employing about half of the work force, accounting for 18 of GDP, and
    contributing 19 to exports. The government has launched a
    multibilliondollar development program in the southeastern region, which
    includes the building of a dozen dams on the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers to
    generate electric power and irrigate large tracts of farmland. The planned
    tapping of huge additional quantities of Euphrates water has raised serious
    concern in the downstream riparian nations of Syria and Iraq. The Turkish
    economy emerged from the Gulf War of early 1991 in stronger shape than
    Ankara had expected. Although the negative effects of the crisis were felt
    primarily in the politically sensitive southeast, aid pledges by the
    coalition allies of more than 4 billion have helped offset the burden.

:Turkmenistan Economy

Overview:
    Like the other 15 former Soviet republics, Turkmenistan faces enormous
    problems of economic adjustment  to move away from Moscowbased central
    planning toward a system of decisionmaking by private enterpreneurs, local
    government authorities, and, hopefully, foreign investors. This process
    requires wholesale changes in supply sources, markets, property rights, and
    monetary arrangements. Industry  with 10 of the labor force  is heavily
    weighted toward the energy sector, which produced 11 of the exUSSRs gas
    and 1 of its oil. Turkmenistan ranked second among the former Soviet
    republics in cotton production, mainly in the irrigated western region,
    where the huge Karakumskiy Canal taps the Amu Darya.

:Tuvalu Economy

Overview:
    Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor soil.
    The country has no known mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence
    farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. The islands are too
    small and too remote for development of a tourist industry. Government
    revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
    remittances. Substantial income is received annually from an international
    trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, New Zealand, and the UK and
    supported also by Japan and South Korea.

:Uganda Economy

Overview:
    Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular
    rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. The economy has
    been devastated by widespread political instability, mismanagement, and
    civil war since independence in 1962, keeping Uganda poor with a per capita
    income of about 300. GDP remains below the levels of the early 1970s, as
    does industrial production. Agriculture is the most important sector of the
    economy, employing over 80 of the work force. Coffee is the major export
    crop and accounts for the bulk of export revenues. Since 1986 the government
    has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the economy by undertaking currency
    reform, raising producer prices on export crops, increasing petroleum
    prices, and improving civil service wages. The policy changes are especially
    aimed at dampening inflation, which was running at over 300 in 1987, and
    boosting production and export earnings. During the period 199091, the
    economy turned in a solid performance based on continued investment in the
    rehabilitation of infrastructure, improved incentives for production and
    exports, and gradually improving domestic security.

:Ukraine Economy

Overview:
    Because of its size, geographic location, Slavic population, and rich
    resources, the loss of Ukraine was the final and most bitter blow to the
    Soviet leaders wishing to preserve some semblance of the old political,
    military, and economic power of the USSR. After Russia, the Ukrainian
    republic was far and away the most important economic component of the
    former Soviet Union producing more than three times the output of the
    nextranking republic. Its fertile black soil generated more than one fourth
    of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms provided substantial quantities
    of meat, milk, grain and vegetables to other republics. Likewise, its
    welldeveloped and diversified heavy industry supplied equipment and raw
    materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the USSR. In
    early 1992 the continued wholesale disruption of economic ties and the lack
    of an institutional structure necessary to formulate and implement economic
    reforms preclude a nearterm recovery of output.

:United Arab Emirates Economy

Overview:
    The UAE has an open economy with one of the worlds highest incomes per
    capita outside the OECD nations. This wealth is based on oil and gas, and
    the fortunes of the economy fluctuate with the prices of those commodities.
    Since 1973, when petroleum prices shot up, the UAE has undergone a profound
    transformation from an impoverished region of small desert principalities to
    a modern state with a high standard of living. At present levels of
    production, crude oil reserves should last for over 100 years.

:United Kingdom Economy

Overview:
    The UK is one of the worlds great trading powers and financial centers, and
    its economy ranks among the four largest in Europe. The economy is
    essentially capitalistic with a generous admixture of social welfare
    programs and government ownership. Prime Minister MAJOR has continued the
    basic thrust of THATCHERs efforts to halt the expansion of welfare measures
    and promote extensive reprivatization of the government economic sector.
    Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by European
    standards, producing about 60 of food needs with only 1 of the labor
    force. Industry is a mixture of public and private enterprises, employing
    about 27 of the work force and generating 22 of GDP. The UK is an
    energyrich nation with large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves primary
    energy production accounts for 12 of GDP, one of the highest shares of any
    industrial nation. In mid1990 the economy fell into recession after eight
    years of strong economic expansion, which had raised national output by one
    quarter. Britains inflation rate, which has been consistently well above
    those of her major trading partners, declined significantly in 1991. Between
    1986 and 1990 unemployment fell from 11 to about 6, but crept back up to
    8 in 1991 because of the economic slowdown. As a major trading nation, the
    UK will continue to be greatly affected by world boom or recession, swings
    in the international oil market, productivity trends in domestic industry,
    and the terms on which the economic integration of Europe proceeds.

:United States Economy

Overview:
    The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced economy
    in the world, with a per capita GDP of 22,470, the largest among major
    industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with most decisions made
    by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of
    goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace. In 1989 the
    economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the
    longest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in wage and
    consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2 of
    the labor force. In 1990, however, growth slowed to 1 because of a
    combination of factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates,
    Iraqs invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and
    a general decline in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output failed
    to recover, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature.
    Ongoing problems for the 1990s include inadequate investment in economic
    infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs, and sizable budget and trade
    deficits.

:Uruguay Economy

Overview:
    The economy is slowly recovering from the deep recession of the early 1980s.
    In 1988 real GDP grew by only 0.5 and in 1989 by 1.5. The recovery was led
    by growth in the agriculture and fishing sectors, agriculture alone
    contributing 20 to GDP, employing about 11 of the labor force, and
    generating a large proportion of export earnings. Raising livestock,
    particularly cattle and sheep, is the major agricultural activity. In 1991,
    domestic growth improved somewhat over 1990, but various government factors,
    including concentration on the external sector, adverse weather conditions,
    and greater attention to bringing down inflation and reducing the fiscal
    deficit kept output from expanding rapidly. In a major step toward greater
    regional economic cooperation, Uruguay joined Brazil, Argentina, and
    Paraguay in forming the Southern Cone Common Market Mercosur. President
    LACALLE continues to press ahead with a broad economic reform plan to reduce
    state intervention in the economy, but he faces strong opposition.

:Uzbekistan Economy

Overview:
    Although Uzbekistan accounted for only 3.4 of total Soviet output, it
    produced twothirds of the USSRs cotton. Moscows push for everincreasing
    amounts of cotton included massive irrigation projects which caused
    extensive environmental damage to the Aral Sea and rivers of the republic.
    Furthermore, the lavish use of chemical fertilizers has caused extensive
    pollution and widespread health problems. Recently the republic has sought
    to encourage food production at the expense of cotton. The small industrial
    sector specializes in such items as agricultural machinery, mineral
    fertilizers, vegetable oil, and electrical cranes. Uzbekistan also has some
    important natural resources including gold about 30 of Soviet production,
    uranium, and natural gas. The Uzbek government has encouraged land reform
    but has shied away from other aspects of economic reform.

    exchange rate, and marketlinked interest rates threw the economy into
    confusion, causing an 8 decline in GDP in 1989. However, the economy
    recovered part way in 1990, and grew by 9.2 in 1991, led by the petroleum
    sector.

:Vietnam Economy

Overview:
    This is a formerly centrally planned, developing economy with extensive
    government ownership and control of productive facilities. The economy is
    primarily agricultural the sector employs about 70 of the labor force and
    accounts for half of GNP. Rice is the staple crop substantial amounts of
    maize, sorghum, cassava, and sweet potatoes are also grown. The government
    permits sale of surplus grain on the open market. Most of the mineral
    resources are located in the north, including coal, which is an important
    export item. Oil was discovered off the southern coast in 1986 with
    production reaching 70,000 barrels per day in 1991 and expected to increase
    in the years ahead. Following the end of the war in 1975, heavyhanded
    government measures undermined efforts at an efficient merger of the
    agricultural resources of the south and the industrial resources of the
    north. The economy remains heavily dependent on foreign aid and has received
    assistance from UN agencies, France, Australia, Sweden, and Communist
    countries. Inflation, although down from recent tripledigit levels, is
    still a major weakness and is showing signs of accelerating upwards again.
    Per capita output is among the worlds lowest. Since late 1986 the
    government has sponsored a broad reform program that seeks to turn more
    economic activity over to the private sector.
