  So Satan spake and him Beelzebub
Thus answered:"Leader of those armies bright
Which, but th Omnipotent, none could have foiled!
If once they hear that voice, their liveliest pledge
Of hope in fears and dangersheard so oft
In worst extremes, and on the perilous edge
Of battle, when it raged, in all assaults
Their surest signalthey will soon resume
New courage and revive, though now they lie
Grovelling and prostrate on yon lake of fire,
As we erewhile, astounded and amazed
No wonder, fallen such a pernicious height!"
  He scare had ceased when the superior Fiend
Was moving toward the shore his ponderous shield,
Ethereal temper, massy, large, and round,
Behind him cast. The broad circumference
Hung on his shoulders like the moon, whose orb
Through optic glass the Tuscan artist views
At evening, from the top of Fesole,
Or in Valdarno, to descry new lands,
Rivers, or mountains, in her spotty globe.
