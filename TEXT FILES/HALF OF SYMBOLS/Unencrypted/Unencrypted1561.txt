  Ill fetch the executioner myself, said the King eagerly, and
he hurried off.

  Alice thought she might as well go back, and see how the game
was going on, as she heard the Queens voice in the distance,
screaming with passion.  She had already heard her sentence three
of the players to be executed for having missed their turns, and
she did not like the look of things at all, as the game was in
such confusion that she never knew whether it was her turn or
not.  So she went in search of her hedgehog.

  The hedgehog was engaged in a fight with another hedgehog,
which seemed to Alice an excellent opportunity for croqueting one
of them with the other:  the only difficulty was, that her
flamingo was gone across to the other side of the garden, where
Alice could see it trying in a helpless sort of way to fly up
into a tree.

  By the time she had caught the flamingo and brought it back,
the fight was over, and both the hedgehogs were out of sight:
but it doesnt matter much, thought Alice, as all the arches
are gone from this side of the ground.  So she tucked it away
under her arm, that it might not escape again, and went back for
a little more conversation with her friend.

  When she got back to the Cheshire Cat, she was surprised to
find quite a large crowd collected round it:  there was a dispute
going on between the executioner, the King, and the Queen, who
were all talking at once, while all the rest were quite silent,
and looked very uncomfortable.

  The moment Alice appeared, she was appealed to by all three to
settle the question, and they repeated their arguments to her,
though, as they all spoke at once, she found it very hard indeed
to make out exactly what they said.

  The executioners argument was, that you couldnt cut off a
head unless there was a body to cut it off from:  that he had
never had to do such a thing before, and he wasnt going to begin
at HIS time of life.

  The Kings argument was, that anything that had a head could be
beheaded, and that you werent to talk nonsense.

  The Queens argument was, that if something wasnt done about
it in less than no time shed have everybody executed, all round.
It was this last remark that had made the whole party look so
grave and anxious.

  Alice could think of nothing else to say but It belongs to the
Duchess:  youd better ask HER about it.

  Shes in prison, the Queen said to the executioner:  fetch
her here.  And the executioner went off like an arrow.

   The Cats head began fading away the moment he was gone, and,
by the time he had come back with the Dutchess, it had entirely
disappeared so the King and the executioner ran wildly up and
down looking for it, while the rest of the party went back to the game.
