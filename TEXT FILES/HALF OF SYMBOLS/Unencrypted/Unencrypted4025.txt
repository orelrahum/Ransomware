Out of despair joy, but with fear yet linked
Which thus to Eve his welcome words renewed.
Eve, easily my faith admit, that all
The good which we enjoy from Heaven descends
But, that from us aught should ascend to Heaven
So prevalent as to concern the mind
Of God highblest, or to incline his will,
Hard to belief may seem yet this will prayer
Or one short sigh of human breath, upborne
