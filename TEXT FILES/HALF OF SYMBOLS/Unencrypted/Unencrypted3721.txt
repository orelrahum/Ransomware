Allured his eye thither his course he bends
Through the calm firmament, but up or down,
By center, or eccentrick, hard to tell,
Or longitude, where the great luminary
Aloof the vulgar constellations thick,
That from his lordly eye keep distance due,
Dispenses light from far they, as they move
Their starry dance in numbers that compute
Days, months, and years, towards his allcheering lamp
Turn swift their various motions, or are turned
