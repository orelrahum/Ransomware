Faithful hath been your warfare, and of God
Accepted, fearless in his righteous cause
And as ye have received, so have ye done,
Invincibly:  But of this cursed crew
The punishment to other hand belongs
Vengeance is his, or whose he sole appoints:
Number to this days work is not ordained,
Nor multitude stand only, and behold
Gods indignation on these godless poured
By me not you, but me, they have despised,
Yet envied against me is all their rage,
Because the Father, to whom in Heaven spreme
Kingdom, and power, and glory appertains,
Hath honoured me, according to his will.
Therefore to me their doom he hath assigned
That they may have their wish, to try with me
In battle which the stronger proves they all,
Or I alone against them since by strength
They measure all, of other excellence
