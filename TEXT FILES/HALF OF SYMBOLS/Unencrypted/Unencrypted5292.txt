:Japan Economy

Overview:
    Governmentindustry cooperation, a strong work ethic, and a comparatively
    small defense allocation have helped Japan advance with extraordinary
    rapidity, notably in hightechnology fields. Industry, the most important
    sector of the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and
    fuels. Selfsufficent in rice, Japan must import 50 of its requirements for
    other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the worlds largest
    fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15 of the global catch. Overall
    economic growth has been spectacular: a 10 average in the 1960s, a 5
    average in the 1970s and 1980s. A major contributor to overall growth of
    4.5 in 1991 was net exports, which cushioned the effect of slower growth in
    domestic demand. Inflation remains low at 3.3 and is easing due to lower
    oil prices and a stronger yen. Japan continues to run a huge trade surplus,
    80 billion in 1991, which supports extensive investment in foreign assets.
    The increased crowding of its habitable land area and the aging of its
    population are two major longrun problems.
