	So must slender Rosalind.
	They that reap must sheaf and bind
	Then to cart with Rosalind.
	Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
	Such a nut is Rosalind.
	He that sweetest rose will find
	Must find loves prick and Rosalind.
	This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
	infect yourself with them?

ROSALIND	Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.

TOUCHSTONE	Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.

ROSALIND	Ill graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
	with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
	i the country for youll be rotten ere you be half
	ripe, and thats the right virtue of the medlar.

TOUCHSTONE	You have said but whether wisely or no, let the
	forest judge.

	Enter CELIA, with a writing

ROSALIND	Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.

CELIA	Reads

	Why should this a desert be?
	For it is unpeopled? No:
	Tongues Ill hang on every tree,
	That shall civil sayings show:
	Some, how brief the life of man
	Runs his erring pilgrimage,
	That the stretching of a span
	Buckles in his sum of age
	Some, of violated vows
	Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
	But upon the fairest boughs,
	Or at every sentence end,
	Will I Rosalinda write,
	Teaching all that read to know
	The quintessence of every sprite
	Heaven would in little show.
	Therefore Heaven Nature charged
	That one body should be filld
	With all graces wideenlarged:
	Nature presently distilld
	Helens cheek, but not her heart,
	Cleopatras majesty,
	Atalantas better part,
	Sad Lucretias modesty.
	Thus Rosalind of many parts
	By heavenly synod was devised,
	Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
	To have the touches dearest prized.
	Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
	And I to live and die her slave.
