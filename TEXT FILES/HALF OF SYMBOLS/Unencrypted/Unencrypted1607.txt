ACT III



SCENE I	A room in the palace.


	Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER

DUKE FREDERICK	Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
	But were I not the better part made mercy,
	I should not seek an absent argument
	Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
	Find out thy brother, wheresoeer he is
	Seek him with candle bring him dead or living
	Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
	To seek a living in our territory.
	Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
	Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
	Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
	Of what we think against thee.

OLIVER	O that your highness knew my heart in this!
	I never loved my brother in my life.

DUKE FREDERICK	More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors
	And let my officers of such a nature
	Make an extent upon his house and lands:
	Do this expediently and turn him going.

	Exeunt

ACT III



SCENE II	The forest.


	Enter ORLANDO, with a paper

ORLANDO	Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
	And thou, thricecrowned queen of night, survey
	With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
	Thy huntress name that my full life doth sway.
	O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
	And in their barks my thoughts Ill character
	That every eye which in this forest looks
	Shall see thy virtue witnessd every where.
	Run, run, Orlando carve on every tree
	The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.

	Exit
