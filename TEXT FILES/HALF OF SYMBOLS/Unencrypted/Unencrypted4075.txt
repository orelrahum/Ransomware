Of sacrifice informing them, by types
And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise
The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve
Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God
To mortal ear is dreadful:  They beseech
That Moses might report to them his will,
And terrour cease he grants what they besought,
Instructed that to God is no access
Without Mediator, whose high office now
Moses in figure bears to introduce
One greater, of whose day he shall foretel,
And all the Prophets in their age the times
