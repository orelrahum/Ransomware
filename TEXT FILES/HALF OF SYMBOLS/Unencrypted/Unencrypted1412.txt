:Central African Republic Economy

Overview:
    Subsistence agriculture, including forestry, is the backbone of the CAR
    economy, with more than 70 of the population living in the countryside. In
    1988 the agricultural sector generated about 40 of GDP. Agricultural
    products accounted for about 60 of export earnings and the diamond industry
    for 30. The countrys 1991 budget deficit was US 70 million and in 1992 is
    expected to be about the same. Important constraints to economic development
    include the CARs landlocked position, a poor transportation system, and a
    weak human resource base. Multilateral and bilateral development assistance,
    particularly from France, plays a major role in providing capital for new
    investment.

:Chad Economy

Overview:
    The climate, geographic location, and lack of infrastructure and natural
    resources potential make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in
    the world. Its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war, conflict
    with Libya, drought, and food shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its
    1977 level, with cotton, the major cash crop, accounting for 48 of exports.
