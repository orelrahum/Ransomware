:Zimbabwe Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture employs threefourths of the labor force and supplies almost 40
    of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture and mining,
    produces a variety of goods and contributes 35 to GDP. Mining accounts for
    only 5 of both GDP and employment, but supplies of minerals and metals
    account for about 40 of exports. Wide yeartoyear fluctuations in
    agricultural production over the past six years have resulted in an uneven
    growth rate, one that on average has matched the 3 annual increase in
    population. Helped by an IMFWorld Bank structural adjustment program,
    output rose 3.5 in 1991. A drought beginning toward the end of 1991
    suggests rough going for 1992.
