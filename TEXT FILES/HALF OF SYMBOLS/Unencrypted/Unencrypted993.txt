:Korea, North Economy

Overview:
    More than 90 of this command economy is socialized agricultural land is
    collectivized and stateowned industry produces 95 of manufactured goods.
    State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist
    country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the
    strict rule of KIM Ilsong and his son, KIM Chongil. Economic growth during
    the period 198489 averaged 23, but output declined by 24 annually
    during 199091, largely because of disruptions in economic relations with
    the USSR. Abundant natural resources and hydropower form the basis of
    industrial development. Output of the extractive industries includes coal,
    iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, zinc, lead, and precious metals.
    Manufacturing is centered on heavy industry, with light industry lagging far
    behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation,
    and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become
    selfsufficient in food production. Four consecutive years of poor harvests,
    coupled with distribution problems, have led to chronic food shortages.
    North Korea remains far behind South Korea in economic development and
    living standards.
