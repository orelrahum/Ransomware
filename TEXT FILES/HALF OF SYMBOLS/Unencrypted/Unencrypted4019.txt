What else but favour, grace, and mercy, shone?
So spake our father penitent nor Eve
Felt less remorse: they, forthwith to the place
Repairing where he judged them, prostrate fell
Before him reverent and both confessed
Humbly their faults, and pardon begged with tears
Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood
Praying for from the mercyseat above
Prevenient grace descending had removed
The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh
Regenerate grow instead that sighs now breathed
