Fanatic Egypt and her priests to seek
Their wandering gods disguised in brutish forms
Rather than human. Nor did Israel scape
Th infection, when their borrowed gold composed
The calf in Oreb and the rebel king
Doubled that sin in Bethel and in Dan,
Likening his Maker to the grazed ox
Jehovah, who, in one night, when he passed
From Egypt marching, equalled with one stroke
Both her firstborn and all her bleating gods.
Belial came last than whom a Spirit more lewd
Fell not from Heaven, or more gross to love
Vice for itself. To him no temple stood
Or altar smoked yet who more oft than he
In temples and at altars, when the priest
Turns atheist, as did Elis sons, who filled
With lust and violence the house of God?
In courts and palaces he also reigns,
And in luxurious cities, where the noise
Of riot ascends above their loftiest towers,
