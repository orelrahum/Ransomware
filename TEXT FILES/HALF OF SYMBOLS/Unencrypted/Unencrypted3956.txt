Waiting desirous her return, had wove
Of choicest flowers a garland, to adorn
Her tresses, and her rural labours crown
As reapers oft are wont their harvestqueen.
Great joy he promised to his thoughts, and new
Solace in her return, so long delayed:
Yet oft his heart, divine of something ill,
Misgave him he the faltering measure felt
And forth to meet her went, the way she took
That morn when first they parted: by the tree
Of knowledge he must pass there he her met,
Scarce from the tree returning in her hand
A bough of fairest fruit, that downy smiled,
New gathered, and ambrosial smell diffused.
To him she hasted in her face excuse
Came prologue, and apology too prompt
Which, with bland words at will, she thus addressed.
Hast thou not wondered, Adam, at my stay?
