:Singapore Economy

Overview:
    Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong service and
    manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links derived from
    its entrepot history. During the 1970s and early 1980s, the economy expanded
    rapidly, achieving an average annual growth rate of 9. Per capita GDP is
    among the highest in Asia. The economy grew at a respectable 6.5 in 1991,
    down from 8.3 in 1990, in part because of a slowdown in overseas demand and
    lower growth in the financial and business services sector.

:Slovenia Economy

Overview:
    Slovenia was by far the most prosperous of the old Yugoslav republics, with
    a per capita income more than twice the Yugoslav average, indeed not far
    below the levels in neighboring Austria and Italy. Because of its strong
    ties to Western Europe and the small scale of damage during internecine
    fighting in Yugoslavia, Slovenia has the brightest prospects among the
    former Yugoslav republics for economic reform and recovery over the next few
    years. The political and economic disintegration of Yugoslavia, however, has
    led to severe shortterm dislocations in production, employment, and trade
    ties. For example, overall industrial production fell 10 in 1991
    particularly hard hit were the iron and steel, machinebuilding, chemical,
    and textile industries. Meanwhile, fighting has continued in other republics
    leading to further destruction of longestablished trade channels and to an
    influx of tens of thousands of Croatian refugees. As in other former
    Communist areas in Eastern Europe, economic reform has often sputtered not
    only because of the vested interests of old bosses in retaining old rules of
    the game but also because of the tangible losses experienced by
    rankandfile people in the transition to a more marketoriented system. The
    key program for breaking up and privatizing major industrial firms has not
    yet begun. Bright spots for encouraging Western investors are Slovenias
    comparatively welleducated work force, its developed infrastructure, and
    its Western business attitudes. Slovenia in absolute terms is a small
    economy, and a little Western investment would go a long way.

:Solomon Islands Economy

Overview:
    About 90 of the population depend on subsistence agriculture, fishing, and
    forestry for at least part of their livelihood. Agriculture, fishing, and
    forestry contribute about 70 to GDP, with the fishing and forestry sectors
    being important export earners. The service sector contributes about 25 to
    GDP. Most manufactured goods and petroleum products must be imported. The
    islands are rich in undeveloped mineral resources such as lead, zinc,
    nickel, and gold. The economy suffered from a severe cyclone in mid1986
    that caused widespread damage to the infrastructure.

:Somalia Economy

Overview:
    One of the worlds poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has few
    resources. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, with the
    livestock sector accounting for about 40 of GDP and about 65 of export
    earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for their
    livelihoods make up more than half of the population. Crop production
    generates only 10 of GDP and employs about 20 of the work force. The main
    export crop is bananas sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic
    market. The small industrial sector is based on the processing of
    agricultural products and accounts for less than 10 of GDP. Greatly
    increased political turmoil in 199192 has resulted in a substantial drop in
    output, with widespread famine a grim fact of life.
