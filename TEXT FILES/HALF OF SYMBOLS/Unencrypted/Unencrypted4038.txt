Ere thou from hence depart know, I am sent
To show thee what shall come in future days
To thee, and to thy offspring: good with bad
Expect to hear supernal grace contending
With sinfulness of men thereby to learn
True patience, and to temper joy with fear
And pious sorrow equally inured
By moderation either state to bear,
Prosperous or adverse: so shalt thou lead
Safest thy life, and best prepared endure
Thy mortal passage when it comes.Ascend
This hill let Eve for I have drenched her eyes
Here sleep below while thou to foresight wakest
