  Alice said nothing she had sat down with her face in her
hands, wondering if anything would EVER happen in a natural way
again.

  I should like to have it explained, said the Mock Turtle.

  She cant explain it, said the Gryphon hastily.  Go on with
the next verse.

  But about his toes? the Mock Turtle persisted.  How COULD
he turn them out with his nose, you know?

  Its the first position in dancing. Alice said but was
dreadfully puzzled by the whole thing, and longed to change the
subject.

  Go on with the next verse, the Gryphon repeated impatiently:
it begins "I passed by his garden."

  Alice did not dare to disobey, though she felt sure it would
all come wrong, and she went on in a trembling voice:

    I passed by his garden, and marked, with one eye,
    How the Owl and the Panther were sharing a pie

        later editions continued as follows
    The Panther took piecrust, and gravy, and meat,
    While the Owl had the dish as its share of the treat.
    When the pie was all finished, the Owl, as a boon,
    Was kindly permitted to pocket the spoon:
    While the Panther received knife and fork with a growl,
    And concluded the banquet
