:Israel Header

Note:
    The Arab territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included
    in the data below. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed
    by President Bushs postGulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of
    the West Bank and Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. The Camp David Accords further specify that these
    negotiations will resolve the location of the respective boundaries. Pending
    the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of the
    West Bank and Gaza Strip has yet to be determined see West Bank and Gaza
    Strip entries. On 25 April 1982 Israel relinquished control of the Sinai to
    Egypt. Statistics for the Israelioccupied Golan Heights are included in the
    Syria entry.
