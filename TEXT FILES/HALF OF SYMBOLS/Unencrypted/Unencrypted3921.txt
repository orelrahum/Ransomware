Proceeding which, in other beasts observed,
Doubt might beget of diabolick power
Active within, beyond the sense of brute.

His bursting passion into plaints thus poured.

With second thoughts, reforming what was old!
O Earth, how like to Heaven, if not preferred
For what God, after better, worse would build?
