    assassinated his elder brother Amin was elected to succeed him. In the
    immediate wake of Bashirs death, however, Christian militiamen massacred
    hundreds of Palestinian refugees in two Beirut camps. This prompted the
    return of the MNF to ease the security burden on Lebanons weak Army and
    security forces. In late March 1984 the last MNF units withdrew. In 1988,
    President Gemayel completed his term of office. Because parliamentarians
    failed to elect a presidential successor, Gemayel appointed then Lebanese
    Armed Forces LAF Commander Gen. Michel Awn acting president. Lebanese
    parliamentarians met in Taif, Saudi Arabia, in late 1989 and concluded a
    national reconciliation pact that codified a new powersharing formula,
    specifying reduced powers for the Christian president and giving Muslims
    more authority. Rene MUAWAD was subsequently elected president on 4 November
    1989, ending a 13month period during which Lebanon had no president and
    rival Muslim and Christian governments. MUAWAD was assassinated 17 days
    later, on 22 November on 24 November, Ilyas Harawi was elected to succeed
    MUAWAD. In October 1990, the civil war was apparently brought to a
    conclusion when Syrian and Lebanese forces ousted renegade Christian General
    Awn from his stronghold in East Beirut. Awn had defied the legitimate
    government and established a separate ministate within East Beirut after
    being appointed acting Prime Minister by outgoing President Gemayel in 1988.
