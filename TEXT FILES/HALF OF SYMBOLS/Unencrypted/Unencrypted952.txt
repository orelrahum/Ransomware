:Iran Economy

Overview:
    Irans economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and
    other large enterprises, village agriculture, and smallscale private
    trading and service ventures. After a decade of economic decline, Irans GNP
    grew roughly 4 in FY90 and 10 in FY91. An oil windfall in 1990 combined
    with a substantial increase in imports contributed to Irans recent economic
    growth. Iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to
    reduce government intervention including subsidies and has allocated
    substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the
    economy. Nevertheless, lower oil revenues in 1991  oil accounts for more
    than 90 of export revenues and provides roughly 65 of the financing for
    the fiveyear economic development plan  and dramatic increases in external
    debt are threatening development plans and could prompt Iran to cut imports,
    thus limiting economic growth in the medium term.
GNP:
    exchange rate conversion  90 billion, per capita 1,500 real growth rate

Inflation rate consumer prices:
