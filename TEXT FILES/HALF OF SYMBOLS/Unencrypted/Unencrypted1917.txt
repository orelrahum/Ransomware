And wheel on the earth, devouring where it rolls
What it devours not, herb, or fruit, or grain,
A darksome cloud of locusts swarming down
Must eat, and on the ground leave nothing green
Darkness must overshadow all his bounds,
Palpable darkness, and blot out three days
Last, with one midnight stroke, all the firstborn
Of Egypt must lie dead.  Thus with ten wounds
The riverdragon tamed at length submits
To let his sojourners depart, and oft
Humbles his stubborn heart but still, as ice
More hardened after thaw till, in his rage
Pursuing whom he late dismissed, the sea
Swallows him with his host but them lets pass,
As on dry land, between two crystal walls
Awed by the rod of Moses so to stand
Divided, till his rescued gain their shore:
Such wondrous power God to his saint will lend,
Though present in his Angel who shall go
Before them in a cloud, and pillar of fire
By day a cloud, by night a pillar of fire
To guide them in their journey, and remove
Behind them, while the obdurate king pursues:
All night he will pursue but his approach
Darkness defends between till morning watch
Then through the fiery pillar, and the cloud,
God looking forth will trouble all his host,
And craze their chariotwheels: when by command
Moses once more his potent rod extends
Over the sea the sea his rod obeys
On their embattled ranks the waves return,
And overwhelm their war:  The race elect
Safe toward Canaan from the shore advance
Through the wild Desart, not the readiest way
Lest, entering on the Canaanite alarmed,
War terrify them inexpert, and fear
Return them back to Egypt, choosing rather
Inglorious life with servitude for life
To noble and ignoble is more sweet
Untrained in arms, where rashness leads not on.
This also shall they gain by their delay
In the wide wilderness there they shall found
Their government, and their great senate choose
Through the twelve tribes, to rule by laws ordained:
God from the mount of Sinai, whose gray top
Shall tremble, he descending, will himself
In thunder, lightning, and loud trumpets sound,
Ordain them laws part, such as appertain
To civil justice part, religious rites
Of sacrifice informing them, by types
And shadows, of that destined Seed to bruise
The Serpent, by what means he shall achieve
Mankinds deliverance.  But the voice of God
To mortal ear is dreadful:  They beseech
That Moses might report to them his will,
And terrour cease he grants what they besought,
Instructed that to God is no access
Without Mediator, whose high office now
Moses in figure bears to introduce
One greater, of whose day he shall foretel,
And all the Prophets in their age the times
Of great Messiah shall sing.  Thus, laws and rites
Established, such delight hath God in Men
Obedient to his will, that he vouchsafes
Among them to set up his tabernacle
The Holy One with mortal Men to dwell:
By his prescript a sanctuary is framed
