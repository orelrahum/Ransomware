The field pavilioned with his guardians bright
Nor that, which on the flaming mount appeared
In Dothan, covered with a camp of fire,
Against the Syrian king, who to surprise
One man, assassinlike, had levied war,
War unproclaimed.  The princely Hierarch
In their bright stand there left his Powers, to seise
Possession of the garden he alone,
To find where Adam sheltered, took his way,
Not unperceived of Adam who to Eve,
While the great visitant approached, thus spake.
