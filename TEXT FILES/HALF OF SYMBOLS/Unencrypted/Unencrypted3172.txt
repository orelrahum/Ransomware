	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.

DUKE SENIOR	Welcome fall to: I will not trouble you
	As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
	Give us some music and, good cousin, sing.

	Because thou art not seen,
	Although thy breath be rude.
	Heighho! sing, heighho! unto the green holly:
	Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
	Then, heighho, the holly!
	This life is most jolly.
	Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
	That dost not bite so nigh
	As benefits forgot:
	Though thou the waters warp,
	Thy sting is not so sharp
	As friend rememberd not.
