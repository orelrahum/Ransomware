:Lesotho Economy

Overview:
    Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural
    resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light
    manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa 153
    million in 1989. The great majority of households gain their livelihoods
    from subsistence farming and migrant labor. Manufacturing depends largely on
    farm products to support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries
    other industries include textile, clothing, and light engineering.
    Industrys share of GDP rose from 6 in 1982 to 15 in 1989. Political and
    economic instability in South Africa raises uncertainty for Lesothos
    economy, especially with respect to migrant worker remittances  typically
    about 40 of GDP.
