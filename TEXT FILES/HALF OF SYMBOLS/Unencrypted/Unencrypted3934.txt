Of God ordained them: His creating hand
Nothing imperfect or deficient left
Of all that he created, much less Man,
Or aught that might his happy state secure,
Secure from outward force within himself
The danger lies, yet lies within his power:
Against his will he can receive no harm.
But God left free the will for what obeys
Reason, is free and Reason he made right,
