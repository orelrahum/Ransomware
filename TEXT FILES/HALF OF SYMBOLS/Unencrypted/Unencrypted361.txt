:Mozambique Economy

Overview:
    One of Africas poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to exploit the
    economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and
    transportation resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and
    investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of
    internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a growing
    foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic
    reform policy, has resulted in successive years of economic growth since
    1985. Agricultural output, nevertheless, is at about only 75 of its 1981
    level, and grain has to be imported. Industry operates at only 2040 of
    capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign assistance to keep afloat.
    The continuation of civil strife through 1991 has dimmed chances of foreign
    investment, and growth was a mere 1. Living standards, already abysmally
    low, dropped by 34 in both 1990 and 1991.
