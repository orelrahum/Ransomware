  There might be some sense in your knocking, the Footman went
on without attending to her, if we had the door between us.  For
instance, if you were INSIDE, you might knock, and I could let
you out, you know.  He was looking up into the sky all the time
he was speaking, and this Alice thought decidedly uncivil.  But
perhaps he cant help it, she said to herself his eyes are so
VERY nearly at the top of his head.  But at any rate he might
answer questions.How am I to get in? she repeated, aloud.

  I shall sit here, the Footman remarked, till tomorrow

  At this moment the door of the house opened, and a large plate
came skimming out, straight at the Footmans head:  it just
grazed his nose, and broke to pieces against one of the trees
behind him.

  or next day, maybe, the Footman continued in the same tone,
exactly as if nothing had happened.

  How am I to get in? asked Alice again, in a louder tone.

  ARE you to get in at all? said the Footman.  Thats the
first question, you know.
