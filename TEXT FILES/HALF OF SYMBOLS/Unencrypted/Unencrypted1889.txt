Amply have merited of me, of all
The infernal empire, that so near Heavens door
Triumphal with triumphal act have met,
Mine, with this glorious work and made one realm,
Hell and this world, one realm, one continent
Of easy thoroughfare.  Therefore, while I
Descend through darkness, on your road with ease,
To my associate Powers, them to acquaint
With these successes, and with them rejoice
You two this way, among these numerous orbs,
All yours, right down to Paradise descend
There dwell, and reign in bliss thence on the earth
Dominion exercise and in the air,
Chiefly on Man, sole lord of all declared
Him first make sure your thrall, and lastly kill.
My substitutes I send ye, and create
Plenipotent on earth, of matchless might
Issuing from me: on your joint vigour now
My hold of this new kingdom all depends,
Through Sin to Death exposed by my exploit.
If your joint power prevail, the affairs of Hell
No detriment need fear go, and be strong!
So saying he dismissed them they with speed
Their course through thickest constellations held,
Spreading their bane the blasted stars looked wan,
And planets, planetstruck, real eclipse
Then suffered.  The other way Satan went down
The causey to Hellgate:  On either side
Disparted Chaos overbuilt exclaimed,
And with rebounding surge the bars assailed,
That scorned his indignation:  Through the gate,
Wide open and unguarded, Satan passed,
And all about found desolate for those,
Appointed to sit there, had left their charge,
Flown to the upper world the rest were all
Far to the inland retired, about the walls
Of Pandemonium city and proud seat
Of Lucifer, so by allusion called
Of that bright star to Satan paragoned
There kept their watch the legions, while the Grand
In council sat, solicitous what chance
Might intercept their emperour sent so he
Departing gave command, and they observed.
As when the Tartar from his Russian foe,
By Astracan, over the snowy plains,
Retires or Bactrin Sophi, from the horns
Of Turkish crescent, leaves all waste beyond
The realm of Aladule, in his retreat
To Tauris or Casbeen:  So these, the late
Heavenbanished host, left desart utmost Hell
Many a dark league, reduced in careful watch
Round their metropolis and now expecting
Each hour their great adventurer, from the search
Of foreign worlds:  He through the midst unmarked,
In show plebeian Angel militant
Of lowest order, passed and from the door
Of that Plutonian hall, invisible
Ascended his high throne which, under state
Of richest texture spread, at the upper end
