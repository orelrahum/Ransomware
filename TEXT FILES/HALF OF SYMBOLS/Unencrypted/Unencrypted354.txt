:Mexico Economy

Overview:
    Mexicos economy is a mixture of stateowned industrial plants notably
    oil, private manufacturing and services, and both largescale and
    traditional agriculture. In the 1980s, Mexico experienced severe economic
    difficulties: the nation accumulated large external debts as world petroleum
    prices fell rapid population growth outstripped the domestic food supply
    and inflation, unemployment, and pressures to emigrate became more acute.
    Growth in national output, however, is recovering, rising from 1.4 in 1988
    to 4 in 1990 and again in 1991. The US is Mexicos major trading partner,
    accounting for twothirds of its exports and imports. After petroleum,
    border assembly plants and tourism are the largest earners of foreign
    exchange. The government, in consultation with international economic
    agencies, is implementing programs to stabilize the economy and foster
    growth. In 1991 the government began negotiations with the US and Canada on
    a free trade agreement.
