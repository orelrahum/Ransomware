To give you an estimation of the difference in the original and
what we have today:  the original was probably entered on cards
commonly known at the time as "IBM cards" Do Not Fold, Spindle
or Mutilate and probably took in excess of 100,000 of them.  A
single card could hold 80 characters hence 80 characters is an
accepted standard for so many computer margins, and the entire
original edition we received in all caps was over 800,000 chars
in length, including line enumeration, symbols for caps and the
punctuation marks, etc., since they were not available keyboard
characters at the time probably the keyboards operated at baud
rates of around 113, meaning the typists had to type slowly for
the keyboard to keep up.

Paradise Lost




Book I


Of Mans first disobedience, and the fruit
Of that forbidden tree whose mortal taste
Brought death into the World, and all our woe,
With loss of Eden, till one greater Man
Restore us, and regain the blissful seat,
Sing, Heavenly Muse, that, on the secret top
Of Oreb, or of Sinai, didst inspire
That shepherd who first taught the chosen seed
In the beginning how the heavens and earth
Rose out of Chaos: or, if Sion hill
Delight thee more, and Siloas brook that flowed
Fast by the oracle of God, I thence
Invoke thy aid to my adventurous song,
That with no middle flight intends to soar
Above th Aonian mount, while it pursues
Things unattempted yet in prose or rhyme.
And chiefly thou, O Spirit, that dost prefer
Before all temples th upright heart and pure,
Instruct me, for thou knowst thou from the first
Wast present, and, with mighty wings outspread,
Dovelike satst brooding on the vast Abyss,
And madst it pregnant: what in me is dark
Illumine, what is low raise and support
That, to the height of this great argument,
I may assert Eternal Providence,
And justify the ways of God to men.
  Say firstfor Heaven hides nothing from thy view,
Nor the deep tract of Hellsay first what cause
Moved our grand parents, in that happy state,
Favoured of Heaven so highly, to fall off
From their Creator, and transgress his will
For one restraint, lords of the World besides.
Who first seduced them to that foul revolt?
  Th infernal Serpent he it was whose guile,
Stirred up with envy and revenge, deceived
The mother of mankind, what time his pride
