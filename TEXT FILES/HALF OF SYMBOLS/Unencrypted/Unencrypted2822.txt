:World Economy

Overview:
    Aggregate world output in 1991 increased by 1.3, in contrast to estimated
    2 growth in 1990 and 3 growth in 1989. In 1991, the developed countries
    grew by 2.5 and the LDCs by 3.5, these gains being offset by a 1015 drop
    in the former Communistdominated areas of the USSR and Eastern Europe. As
    usual, results among individual countries differed widely. In the developed
    group, Japan led with 4.5, the West European members averaged 1.2, and the
    recessionplagued United States lagged,with GDP down 0.7. As for the 15
    former Soviet republics and the seven nations of Eastern Europe, output
    plummeted in many economic sectors because of fundamental changes in the
    rules of the game and in the channels of production and exchange. China and
    the Four Dragons performed well in 1991 but many of the other developing
    countries are mired in poverty and political instability. For the world as a
    whole, the addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an already
    overcrowded globe will exacerbate the problems of pollution,
    desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine.
