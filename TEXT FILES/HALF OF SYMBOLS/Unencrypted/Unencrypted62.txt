:Indonesia Economy

Overview:
    Indonesia is a mixed economy with many socialist institutions and central
    planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise.
    Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly
    increasing population, it remains a poor country. GDP growth in 198591
    averaged about 6, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both slash
    underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering the
    labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an important
    sector, accounting for 23 of GDP and over 50 of the labor force. The
    staple crop is rice. Once the worlds largest rice importer, Indonesia is
    now nearly selfsufficient. Plantation crops  rubber and palm oil  and
    textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job
    generation. Industrial output now accounts for 30 of GDP and is based on a
    supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural gas,
    timber, metals, and coal. Of these, the oil sector dominates the external
    economy, generating more than 20 of the governments revenues and 40 of
    export earnings in 1989. However, the economys growth is highly dependent
    on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. Japan is Indonesias most
    important customer and supplier of aid. In 1991, rapid growth in the money
    supply prompted Jakarta to implement a tight monetary policy, forcing the
    private sector to go to foreign banks for investment financing. Real
    interest rates remained above 10, offshore commercial debt grew, and real
    GDP growth dropped slightly from the 7 of 1990.

:Iran Economy

Overview:
    Irans economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and
    other large enterprises, village agriculture, and smallscale private
    trading and service ventures. After a decade of economic decline, Irans GNP
    grew roughly 4 in FY90 and 10 in FY91. An oil windfall in 1990 combined
    with a substantial increase in imports contributed to Irans recent economic
    growth. Iran has also begun implementing a number of economic reforms to
    reduce government intervention including subsidies and has allocated
    substantial resources to development projects in the hope of stimulating the
    economy. Nevertheless, lower oil revenues in 1991  oil accounts for more
    than 90 of export revenues and provides roughly 65 of the financing for
    the fiveyear economic development plan  and dramatic increases in external
    debt are threatening development plans and could prompt Iran to cut imports,
    thus limiting economic growth in the medium term.

:Iraq Economy

Overview:
    The Bathist regime engages in extensive central planning and management of
    industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some smallscale
    industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise. The
    economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which has provided about 95
    of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s financial problems, caused by
    massive expenditures in the eightyear war with Iran and damage to oil
    export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement austerity
    measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt payments.
    After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually increased with
    the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged facilities.
    Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages, salinization,
    and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization
    programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high priority by the
    government, also was under financial constraints. Iraqs seizure of Kuwait
    in August 1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, and military
    actions by an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically
    changed the economic picture. Oil exports were cut to near zero, and
    industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged. Throughout
    1991, the UNs economic embargo worked to reduce exports and imports and to
    increase prices for most goods. The governments policy to allocate goods to
    key supporters of the regime exacerbated shortages.
