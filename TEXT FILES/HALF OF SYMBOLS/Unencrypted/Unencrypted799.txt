:British Virgin Islands Economy

Overview:
    The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, is highly
    dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21 of the national
    income. In 1985 the government offered offshore registration to companies
    wishing to incorporate in the islands, and, in consequence, incorporation
    fees generated about 2 million in 1987. Livestock raising is the most
    significant agricultural activity. The islands crops, limited by poor
    soils, are unable to meet food requirements.
