:Gabon Economy

Overview:
    The economy, dependent on timber and manganese until the early 1970s, is now
    dominated by the oil sector. During the period 198185, oil accounted for
    about 46 of GDP, 83 of export earnings, and 65 of government revenues on
    average. The high oil prices of the early 1980s contributed to a substantial
    increase in per capita income, stimulated domestic demand, reinforced
    migration from rural to urban areas, and raised the level of real wages to
    among the highest in SubSaharan Africa. The threeyear slide of Gabons
    economy, which began with falling oil prices in 1985, was reversed in 1989
    because of a near doubling of oil prices over their 1988 lows. In 1990 the
    economy posted strong growth despite serious strikes, but debt servicing
    problems are hindering economic advancement. The agricultural and industrial
    sectors are relatively underdeveloped, except for oil.

Note:
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
    Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bushs post  Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of
    the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors,
    and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined. In the US view, the term West Bank describes all
    of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian administration before
    the 1967 ArabIsraeli war. With respect to negotiations envisaged in the
    framework agreement, however, it is US policy that a distinction must be
    made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank because of the citys
    special status and circumstances. Therefore, a negotiated solution for the
    final status of Jerusalem could be different in character from that of the
    rest of the West Bank.
    The Gaza Strip is currently governed by Israeli military authorities and
    Israeli civil administration it is US policy that the final status of the
    Gaza Strip will be determined by negotiations among the concerned parties
    these negotiations will determine how this area is to be governed.
    There are 18 Jewish settlements in the Gaza Strip.

:Gaza Strip Economy

Overview:
    In 1990 roughly 40 of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by
    Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker
    remittances accounting for about onethird of GNP. The construction,
    agricultural, and industrial sectors account for about 15, 12, and 8 of
    GNP, respectively. Gaza depends upon Israel for some 90 of its external
    trade. Unrest in the territory in 198892 intifadah has raised
    unemployment and substantially lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The
    Persian Gulf crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt severe blows to Gaza
    since August 1990. Worker remittances from the Gulf states have plunged,
    unemployment has increased, and exports have fallen dramatically. The areas
    economic outlook remains bleak.

:Georgia Economy

Overview:
    Among the former Soviet republics, Georgia is noted for its Black Sea
    tourist industry, its large output of citrus fruits and tea, and the amazing
    diversity of an industrial sector that accounted, however, for less than 2
    of the USSRs output. Another salient characteristic of the economy has been
    a flourishing private sector compared with the other republics. Almost 30
    of the labor force is employed in agriculture and 18 in industry. Mineral
    resources consist of manganese and copper, and, to a lesser extent,
    molybdenum, arsenic, tungsten, and mercury. Except for very small quantities
    of domestic oil, gas, and coal, fuel must be imported from neighboring
    republics. Oil and its products are delivered by pipeline from Azerbaijan to
    the port of Batumi for export and local refining. Gas is supplied in
    pipelines from Krasnodar and Stavropol. Georgia is nearly selfsufficient
    in electric power, thanks to abundant hydropower stations as well as some
    thermal power stations. The dismantling of central economic controls is
    being delayed by political factionalism, marked by armed struggles between
    the elected government and the opposition, and industrial output seems to
    have fallen more steeply in Georgia in 1991 than in any other of the former
    Soviet republics. To prevent further economic decline, Georgia must
    establish domestic peace and must maintain economic ties to the other former
    Soviet republics while developing new links to the West.

:Germany Economy

Overview:
    The Federal Republic of Germany is making substantial progress in
    integrating and modernizing eastern Germany, but at a heavy economic cost.
    Western Germanys growth in 1991 slowed to 3.1  the lowest rate since 1987
     because of slack world growth and higher interest rates and taxes required
    by the unification process. While western Germanys economy was in recession
    in the last half of 1991, eastern Germanys economy bottomed out after a
    nearly twoyear freefall and shows signs of recovery, particularly in the
    construction, transportation, and service sectors. Eastern Germany could
    begin a fragile recovery later, concentrated in 1992 in construction,
    transportation, and services. The two regions remain vastly different,
    however, despite eastern Germanys progress. Western Germany has an advanced
    market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly urbanized
    and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards, abundant
    leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is
    relatively poor in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.
    Western Germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically advanced
    goods. The regions economy is mature: services and manufacturing account
    for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw materials and
    semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports. In recent
    years, manufacturing has accounted for about 31 of GDP, with other sectors
    contributing lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1990 accounted for
    about 21 of GDP. In 1991, GDP in the western region was an estimated
    19,200 per capita. In contrast, eastern Germanys economy is shedding the
    obsolete heavy industries that dominated the economy during the Communist
    era. Eastern Germanys share of allGerman GDP is only about 7, and eastern
    productivity is just 30 that of the west. The privatization agency for
    eastern Germany, the Treuhand, is rapidly selling many of the 11,500 firms
    under its control. The pace of private investment is starting to pick up,
    but questions about property rights and environmental liabilities remain.
    Eastern Germany has one of the worlds largest reserves of lowgrade lignite
    coal but little else in the way of mineral resources. The quality of
    statistics from eastern Germany is improving, yet many gaps remain the
    federal government began producing allGerman data for select economic
    statistics at the start of 1992. The most challenging economic problem is
    promoting eastern Germanys economic reconstruction  specifically, finding
    the right mix of fiscal, monetary, regulatory, and tax policies that will
    spur investment in eastern Germany  without destabilizing western Germanys
    economy or damaging relations with West European partners. The biggest
    danger is that excessive wage settlements and heavy federal borrowing could
    fuel inflation and prompt the German Central Bank, the Bundesbank, to keep a
    tight monetary policy to choke off a wageprice spiral. Meanwhile, the FRG
    has been providing billions of dollars to help the former Soviet republics
    and the reformist economies of Eastern Europe.

:Ghana Economy

Overview:
    Supported by substantial international assistance, Ghana has been
    implementing a steady economic rebuilding program since 1983, including
    moves toward privatization and relaxation of government controls. Heavily
    dependent on cocoa, gold, and timber exports, economic growth so far has not
    spread substantially to other areas of the economy. The costs of sending
    peacekeeping forces to Liberia and preparing for the transition to a
    democratic government have been boosting government expenditures and
    undercutting structural adjustment reforms. Ghana opened a stock exchange in
    1990. Much of the economic improvement in 1991 was caused by favorable
    weather following a severe drought the previous year that led to plentiful
    harvests in Ghanas agriculturally based economy.

:Gibraltar Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends heavily on British defense expenditures, revenue from
    tourists, fees for services to shipping, and revenues from banking and
    finance activities. Because more than 70 of the economy is in the public
    sector, changes in government spending have a major impact on the level of
    employment. Construction workers are particularly affected when government
    expenditures are cut.

:Greece Economy

Overview:
    Greece has a mixed capitalistic economy with the basic entrepreneurial
    system overlaid in 198189 by a socialist government that enlarged the
    public sector from 55 of GDP in 1981 to about 70 when Prime Minister
    Mitsotakis took office. Tourism continues as a major industry, and
    agriculture  although handicapped by geographic limitations and fragmented,
    small farms  is selfsufficient except for meat, dairy products, and animal
    feedstuffs. The Mitsotakis government inherited several severe economic
    problems from the preceding socialist and caretaker administrations, which
    had neglected the runaway budget deficit, a ballooning current account
    deficit, and accelerating inflation. In early 1991, the government secured a
    2.5 billion assistance package from the EC under the strictest terms yet
    imposed on a member country, as the EC finally ran out of patience with
    Greeces failure to put its financial affairs in order. Over the next three
    years, Athens must bring inflation down to 7, cut the current account
    deficit and central government borrowing as a percentage of GDP, slash
    publicsector employment by 10, curb publicsector pay raises, and broaden
    the tax base.

:Greenland Economy

Overview:
    Over the past 25 years, the economy has changed from one based on
    subsistence whaling, hunting, and fishing to one dependent on foreign trade.
    Fishing is still the most important industry, accounting for over 75 of
    exports and about 25 of the populations income. Maintenance of a social
    welfare system similar to Denmarks has given the public sector a dominant
    role in the economy. In 1990, the economy became critically dependent on
    shrimp exports and on an annual subsidy now about 500 million from the
    Danish Government because cod exports dropped off and commercial mineral
    production stopped. As of 1992, the government also has taken control of the
    health sector from Denmark. The new Home Rule government installed in March
    1991 has decided to end much of the central control of the economy and to
    open it wider to competitive forces.

:Grenada Economy

Overview:
    The economy is essentially agricultural and centers on the traditional

    Manufacturing remains relatively undeveloped, but is expected to grow, given
    a more favorable private investment climate since 1983. Despite an

:Guadeloupe Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services.
    It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. Tourism is
    a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly
    large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important
    sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas
    which now supply about 50 of export earnings, eggplant, and flowers.
    Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption,
    although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly
    from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production.
    Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially
    high among the young.

:GuineaBissau Economy

Overview:
    GuineaBissau ranks among the poorest countries in the world, with a per
    capita GDP below 200. Agriculture and fishing are the main economic
    activities. Cashew nuts, peanuts, and palm kernels are the primary exports.

    fouryear plan 198891 has targeted agricultural development as the top
    priority.

:Guyana Economy

Overview:
    Guyana is one of the worlds poorest countries with a per capita income less
    than onefifth the South American average. After growing on average at less
    than 1 a year in 198687, GDP dropped by 5 a year in 198890. The decline
    resulted from bad weather, labor trouble in the canefields, and flooding and
    equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about 100
    in 1989 and 75 in 1990, and the current account deficit widened
    substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric power is
    in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in national
    output. The government, in association with international financial
    agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds. The
    governments stabilization program  aimed at establishing realistic
    exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of growth 
    requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience
    by consumers during a long incubation period. In 1991, buoyed by a recovery
    in mining and agriculture, the economy posted 6 growth, according to
    official figures. A large volume of illegal and quasi legal economic
    activity is not captured in estimates of the countrys total output.

:Haiti Economy

Overview:
    About 75 of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is mainly
    smallscale subsistence farming and employs nearly threefourths of the work
    force. The majority of the population does not have ready access to safe
    drinking water, adequate medical care, or sufficient food. Few social
    assistance programs exist, and the lack of employment opportunities remains
    one of the most critical problems facing the economy, along with soil
    erosion and political instability. Trade sanctions applied by the
    Organization of American States in response to the September 1991 coup
    against President Aristide have further damaged the economy.

:Honduras Economy

Overview:
    Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
    Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for more
    than 25 of GDP, employs 62 of the labor force, and produces twothirds of
    exports. Productivity remains low. Industry, still in its early stages,
    employs nearly 9 of the labor force, accounts for 15 of GDP, and generates
    20 of exports. The service sectors, including public administration,
    account for 50 of GDP and employ nearly 20 of the labor force. Basic
    problems facing the economy include rapid population growth, high
    unemployment, sharply increased inflation, a lack of basic services, a large
    and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of the export sector
    mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations.
    Despite government efforts at reform and largescale foreign assistance, the
    economy still is unable to take advantage of its sizable natural resources.

:Hong Kong Economy

Overview:
    Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or nontariff
    barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be
    imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 18 of GDP, employs 28 of the
    labor force, and exports about 90 of its output. Real GDP growth averaged a
    remarkable 8 in 198788, then slowed to 2.53.0 in 198990. Unemployment,
    which has been declining since the mid1980s, is now about 2. A shortage of
    labor continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of living.
    Shortterm prospects remain solid so long as major trading partners continue
    to be reasonably prosperous. The crackdown in China in 198991 casts a
    shadow over the longer term economic outlook.

:Hungary Economy

Overview:
    Hungary is in the midst of a difficult transition between a command and a
    market economy. Agriculture is an important sector, providing sizable export
    earnings and meeting domestic food needs. Industry accounts for about 40 of
    GDP and 30 of employment. Hungary claims that less than 20 of foreign
    trade is now with former CEMA countries, while about 70 is with OECD
    members. Hungarys economic reform programs during the Communist era gave it
    a head start in creating a market economy and attracting foreign investment.
    In 1990, Hungary received half of all foreign investment in Eastern Europe
    and in 1991 received the largest single share. The growing private sector
    accounts for onequarter to onethird of national output according to
    unofficial estimates. Privatization of state enterprises is progressing,
    although excessive redtape, bureaucratic oversight, and uncertainties about
    pricing have slowed the process. Escalating unemployment and high rates of
    inflation may impede efforts to speed up privatization and budget reform,
    while Hungarys heavy foreign debt will make the government reluctant to
    introduce full convertability of the forint before 1993.

:Iceland Economy

Overview:
    Icelands prosperous Scandinaviantype economy is basically capitalistic,
    but with extensive welfare measures, low unemployment, and comparatively
    even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
    industry, which provides nearly 75 of export earnings. In the absence of
    other natural resources, Icelands economy is vulnerable to changing world
    fish prices. The economic improvements resulting from climbing fish prices
    in 1990 and a noninflationary labor agreement probably will be reversed by
    tighter fish quotas and a delay in the construction of an aluminum smelting
    plant. The conservative governments economic priorities include reducing
    the budget and current account deficits, containing inflation, revising
    agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and tying the
    krona to the ECs European currency unit in 1993. The fishing industries 
    notably the shrimp industry  are experiencing a series of bankruptcies and
    mergers. Inflation has continued to drop sharply from 20 in 1989 to about
    7.5 in 1991 and possibly 3 in 1992, while unemployment is expected to
    increase to 2.5. GDP is expected to contract by nearly 4 in 1992.
