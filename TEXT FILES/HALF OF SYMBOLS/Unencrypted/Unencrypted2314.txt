    and dislocations caused by previous land reform and collectivization
    programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high priority by the
    government, also was under financial constraints. Iraqs seizure of Kuwait
    in August 1990, subsequent international economic embargoes, and military
    actions by an international coalition beginning in January 1991 drastically
    changed the economic picture. Oil exports were cut to near zero, and
    industrial and transportation facilities were severely damaged. Throughout
    1991, the UNs economic embargo worked to reduce exports and imports and to
    increase prices for most goods. The governments policy to allocate goods to
    key supporters of the regime exacerbated shortages.
