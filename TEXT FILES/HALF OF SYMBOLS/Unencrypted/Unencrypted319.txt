:Ivory Coast Economy

Overview:
    Ivory Coast is among the worlds largest producers and exporters of coffee,
    cocoa beans, and palmkernel oil. Consequently, the economy is highly
    sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and cocoa and
    to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to diversify, the
    economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related industries.
    The agricultural sector accounts for over onethird of GDP and about 80 of
    export earnings and employs about 85 of the labor force. A collapse of
    world cocoa and coffee prices in 1986 threw the economy into a recession,
    from which the country had not recovered by 1990. Continuing poor prices for
    commodity exports, an overvalued exchange rate, a bloated publicsector wage
    bill, and a large foreign debt hindered economic recovery in 1991.
