:Canada Economy

Overview:
    As an affluent, hightech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles
    the US in per capita output, marketoriented economic system, and pattern of
    production. Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing,
    mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural
    economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada
    registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations,
    averaging about 3.2. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force,
    and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects. However,
    the continuing constitutional impasse between English and Frenchspeaking
    areas has observers discussing a possible split in the confederation
    foreign investors are becoming edgy.
