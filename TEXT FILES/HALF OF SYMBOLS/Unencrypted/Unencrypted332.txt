Overview:
    One of the worlds poorest nations, Laos has had a Communist centrally

    decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise. Laos is a
    landlocked country with a primitive infrastructure that is, it has no
    railroads, a rudimentary road system, limited external and internal
    telecommunications, and electricity available in only a limited area.
    Subsistence agriculture is the main occupation, accounting for over 60 of
    GDP and providing about 8590 of total employment. The predominant crop is
    rice. For the foreseeable future the economy will continue to depend for its
    survival on foreign aid from the IMF and other international sources aid
    from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply.
