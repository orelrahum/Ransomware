:Netherlands Economy

Overview:
    This highly developed and affluent economy is based on private enterprise.
    The government makes its presence felt, however, through many regulations,
    permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting most aspects of economic
    activity. The trade and financial services sector contributes over 50 of
    GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25 of GDP and is led by the
    foodprocessing, oilrefining, and metalworking industries. The highly
    mechanized agricultural sector employs only 5 of the labor force, but
    provides large surpluses for export and the domestic foodprocessing
    industry. An unemployment rate of 6.2 and a sizable budget deficit are
    currently the most serious economic problems.
