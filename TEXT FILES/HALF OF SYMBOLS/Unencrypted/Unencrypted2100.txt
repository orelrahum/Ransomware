:Christmas Island Economy

Overview:
    Phosphate mining had been the only significant economic activity, but in
    December 1987 the Australian Government closed the mine as no longer
    economically viable. Plans have been under way to reopen the mine and also
    to build a casino and hotel to develop tourism, with a possible opening date
    during the first half of 1992.
