ROSALIND	Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.

TOUCHSTONE	Nay, I shall neer be ware of mine own wit till I
	break my shins against it.

ROSALIND	Jove, Jove! this shepherds passion
	Is much upon my fashion.

TOUCHSTONE	And mine but it grows something stale with me.

CELIA	I pray you, one of you question yond man
	If he for gold will give us any food:
	I faint almost to death.
