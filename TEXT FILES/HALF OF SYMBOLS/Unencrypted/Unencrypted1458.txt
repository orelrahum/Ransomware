:Malaysia Economy

Overview:
    During the period 198891 booming exports helped Malaysia continue to
    recover from the severe 198586 recession. Real output grew by 8.8 in 1989,
    10 in 1990, and 8.6 in 1991, helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing
    output, further increases in foreign direct investment  particularly from
    Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home  and increased oil
    production. Malaysia has become the worlds thirdlargest producer of
    semiconductor devices after the US and Japan and the worlds largest
    exporter of semiconductor devices. Inflation has remained low unemployment
    has stood at 6 of the labor force and the government has followed prudent
    fiscalmonetary policies. The country is not selfsufficient in food, and
    some of the rural population subsist at the poverty level. Malaysias high
    export dependence leaves it vulnerable to a recession in the OECD countries
    or a fall in world commodity prices.
