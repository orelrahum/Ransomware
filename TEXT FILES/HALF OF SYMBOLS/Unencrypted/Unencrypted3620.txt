Regions of sorrow, doleful shades, where peace
And rest can never dwell, hope never comes
That comes to all, but torture without end
Still urges, and a fiery deluge, fed
With everburning sulphur unconsumed.
Such place Eternal Justice has prepared
For those rebellious here their prison ordained
In utter darkness, and their portion set,
As far removed from God and light of Heaven
As from the centre thrice to th utmost pole.
Oh how unlike the place from whence they fell!
There the companions of his fall, oerwhelmed
With floods and whirlwinds of tempestuous fire,
He soon discerns and, weltering by his side,
One next himself in power, and next in crime,
Long after known in Palestine, and named
Beelzebub. To whom th ArchEnemy,
And thence in Heaven called Satan, with bold words
Breaking the horrid silence, thus began:
  "If thou beest hebut O how fallen! how changed
From him who, in the happy realms of light
Clothed with transcendent brightness, didst outshine
Myriads, though bright!if he whom mutual league,
United thoughts and counsels, equal hope
And hazard in the glorious enterprise
