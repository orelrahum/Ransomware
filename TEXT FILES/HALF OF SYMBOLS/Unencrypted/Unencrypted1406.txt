:Brazil Economy

Overview:
    The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors, entered
    the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an unserviceable
    foreign debt of 122 billion, and a lack of policy direction. In addition,
    the economy remained highly regulated, inwardlooking, and protected by
    substantial trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and
    mining facilities is divided among private interests  including several
    multinationals  and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are
    private, with the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts
    between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent
    violence. The Collor government, which assumed office in March 1990, is
    embarked on an ambitious reform program that seeks to modernize and
    reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy,
    and opening it to increased foreign competition. The government in December
    1991 signed a letter of intent with the IMF for a 20month standby loan.
    Having reached an agreement on the repayment of interest arrears accumulated
    during 1989 and 1990, Brazilian officials and commercial bankers are engaged
    in talks on the reduction of medium and longterm debt and debt service
    payments and on the elimination of remaining interest arrears. A major
    longrun strength is Brazils vast natural resources.

:British Virgin Islands Economy

Overview:
    The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, is highly
    dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21 of the national
    income. In 1985 the government offered offshore registration to companies
    wishing to incorporate in the islands, and, in consequence, incorporation
    fees generated about 2 million in 1987. Livestock raising is the most
    significant agricultural activity. The islands crops, limited by poor
    soils, are unable to meet food requirements.
