    supplies from the outside have severely strained the availability of food
    throughout the republic. The combination of the poor food supply, the
    general disruption of industrial links to suppliers and markets, and
    political instability have meant that the republics leadership could make
    little progress in economic reform in 1991 and early 1992.

:Tanzania Economy

    heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 47 of GDP,
    provides 85 of exports, and employs 90 of the work force. Industry
    accounts for 8 of GDP and is mainly limited to processing agricultural
    products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery program announced
    in mid1986 has generated notable increases in agricultural production and
    financial support for the program by bilateral donors. The World Bank, the
    International Monetary Fund, and bilateral donors have provided funds to
    rehabilitate Tanzanias deteriorated economic infrastructure. Growth in 1991
    was featured by a pickup in industrial production and a substantial increase
    in output of minerals led by gold.

:Thailand Economy

Overview:
    Thailand, one of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, enjoyed a
    year of 8 growth in 1991, although down from an annual average of 11
    growth between 1987 and 1990. The increasingly sophisticated manufacturing
    sector benefited from exportoriented investment. The manufacturing and
    service sectors have accounted for the lions share of economic growth.
    Thailands traditional agricultural sector continued to become less
    important to the overall economy in 1991. The trade deficit continued to
    increase in 1991, to 11 billion earnings from tourism and remittances grew
    marginally as a result of the Gulf War and Thailands import bill grew,
    especially for manufactures and oil. The government has followed fairly
    sound fiscal and monetary policies. Aided by increased tax receipts from the
    fastmoving economy Bangkok recorded its fourth consecutive budget surplus
    in 1991. The government is moving ahead with new projects  especially for
    telecommunications, roads, and port facilities  needed to refurbish the
    countrys overtaxed infrastructure. Political unrest and the militarys
    shooting of antigovernment demonstrators in May 1992 have caused
    international businessmen to question Thailands political stability.
    Thailands general economic outlook remains good, however, assuming the
    continuation of the governments progrowth measures.

:Togo Economy

Overview:
    The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which accounts
    for about 35 of GDP and provides employment for 78 of the labor force.
    Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and cotton, which together
    account for about 30 of total export earnings. Togo is selfsufficient in
    basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector
    phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, with phosphate
    exports accounting for about 40 of total foreign exchange earnings. Togo
    serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government, over the
    past decade, with IMF and World Bank support, has been implementing a number
    of economic reform measures, that is, actively encouraging foreign
    investment and attempting to bring revenues in line with expenditures.
    Political unrest throughout 1991, however, has jeopardized the reform
    program and has disrupted vital economic activity.
