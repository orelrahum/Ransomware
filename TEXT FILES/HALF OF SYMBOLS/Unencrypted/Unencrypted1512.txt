:Yemen Economy

Overview:
    Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united Yemen,
    the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, is the
    economic and commercial capital. Future economic development depends heavily
    on Westernassisted development of promising oil resources. South Yemens
    willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady decline in Soviet
    economic support.
Overview:
  North:
    The low level of domestic industry and agriculture have made northern Yemen
    dependent on imports for virtually all of its essential needs. Large trade
    deficits have been made up for by remittances from Yemenis working abroad
    and foreign aid. Once selfsufficient in food production, northern Yemen has
    become a major importer. Land once used for export crops  cotton, fruit,
    and vegetables  has been turned over to growing qat, a mildly narcotic
    shrub chewed by Yemenis which has no significant export market. Oil export
    revenues started flowing in late 1987 and boosted 1988 earnings by about
    800 million.
  South:
    This has been one of the poorest Arab countries, with a per capita GNP of
    about 500. A shortage of natural resources, a widely dispersed population,
    and an arid climate have made economic development difficult. The economy
    has grown at an average annual rate of only 23 since the mid1970s. The
    economy had been organized along socialist lines, dominated by the public
    sector. Economic growth has been constrained by a lack of incentives, partly
    stemming from centralized control over production decisions, investment
    allocation, and import choices.

:Zaire Economy

Overview:
    In 1990, in spite of large mineral resources Zaire had a GDP per capita of
    only about 260, putting it among the desperately poor African nations. The
    countrys chronic economic problems worsened in 1991, with copper and cobalt
    production down 2030, inflation near 8,000 in 1991 as compared with 100
    in 198789, and IMF and most World Bank support suspended until the
    institution of agreedon changes. Agriculture, a key sector of the economy,
    employs 75 of the population but generates under 25 of GDP. The main
    potential for economic development has been the extractive industries.
    Mining and mineral processing account for about onethird of GDP and
    threequarters of total export earnings. Zaire is the worlds largest
    producer of diamonds and cobalt.
