:Honduras Economy

Overview:
    Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere.
    Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for more
    than 25 of GDP, employs 62 of the labor force, and produces twothirds of
    exports. Productivity remains low. Industry, still in its early stages,
    employs nearly 9 of the labor force, accounts for 15 of GDP, and generates
    20 of exports. The service sectors, including public administration,
    account for 50 of GDP and employ nearly 20 of the labor force. Basic
    problems facing the economy include rapid population growth, high
    unemployment, sharply increased inflation, a lack of basic services, a large
    and inefficient public sector, and the dependence of the export sector
    mostly on coffee and bananas, which are subject to sharp price fluctuations.
    Despite government efforts at reform and largescale foreign assistance, the
    economy still is unable to take advantage of its sizable natural resources.
