:Netherlands Antilles Economy

    economy. The islands enjoy a high per capita income and a welldeveloped

    the US being the major supplier.

:New Zealand Economy

Overview:
    Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian economy dependent
    on a guaranteed British market to an open free market economy that can
    compete on the global scene. The government has hoped that dynamic growth
    would boost real incomes, reduce inflationary pressures, and permit the
    expansion of welfare benefits. The results have been mixed: inflation is
    down from doubledigit levels, but growth has been sluggish and
    unemployment, always a highly sensitive issue, has exceeded 10 since May
    1991. In 1988, GDP fell by 1, in 1989 grew by a moderate 2.4, and was flat

:Nicaragua Economy

Overview:
    Government control of the economy historically has been extensive, although
    the CHAMORRO government has pledged to greatly reduce intervention. Four
    private banks have been licensed, and the government has liberalized foreign
    trade and abolished price controls on most goods. Over 50 of the
    agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned. Sandinista economic
    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation
    of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities,
    largely coffee and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7 in 1989 and 4
    in 1990, and remained about even in 1991. The agricultural sector employs
    44 of the work force and accounts for 15 of GDP and 80 of export
    earnings. Industry, which employs 13 of the work force and contributes
    about 25 to GDP, showed a drop of 7 in 1989, fell slightly in 1990, and
    remained flat in 1991 output still is below pre1979 levels. External debt
