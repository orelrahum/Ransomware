	against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
	treacherous device and never leave thee till he
	hath taen thy life by some indirect means or other
	for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
	it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
	day living. I speak but brotherly of him but
	should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
	blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.

CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
	tomorrow, Ill give him his payment: if ever he go
	alone again, Ill never wrestle for prize more: and
	so God keep your worship!

OLIVER	Farewell, good Charles.

	Exit CHARLES

	Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
	an end of him for my soul, yet I know not why,
	hates nothing more than he. Yet hes gentle, never
	schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
	all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
	in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
	people, who best know him, that I am altogether
	misprised: but it shall not be so long this
	wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
	I kindle the boy thither which now Ill go about.

	Exit

ACT I



SCENE II	Lawn before the Dukes palace.


	Enter CELIA and ROSALIND

CELIA	I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.

ROSALIND	Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of
	and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
	teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
	learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.

CELIA	Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
	that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
	had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
	hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
	love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
	if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
