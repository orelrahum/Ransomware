Some easier enterprise? There is a place
If ancient and prophetic fame in Heaven
Err notanother World, the happy seat
Of some new race, called Man, about this time
To be created like to us, though less
In power and excellence, but favoured more
Of him who rules above so was his will
Pronounced among the Gods, and by an oath
That shook Heavens whole circumference confirmed.
Thither let us bend all our thoughts, to learn
What creatures there inhabit, of what mould
Or substance, how endued, and what their power
And where their weakness: how attempted best,
By force of subtlety. Though Heaven be shut,
And Heavens high Arbitrator sit secure
In his own strength, this place may lie exposed,
The utmost border of his kingdom, left
To their defence who hold it: here, perhaps,
Some advantageous act may be achieved
By sudden onseteither with Hellfire
To waste his whole creation, or possess
All as our own, and drive, as we were driven,
The puny habitants or, if not drive,
Seduce them to our party, that their God
May prove their foe, and with repenting hand
