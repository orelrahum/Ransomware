:Burkina Economy

Overview:
    One of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina has a high population
    density, few natural resources, and relatively infertile soil. Economic
    development is hindered by a poor communications network within a landlocked
    country. Agriculture provides about 40 of GDP and is entirely of a
    subsistence nature. Industry, dominated by unprofitable
    governmentcontrolled corporations, accounts for about 15 of GDP.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion  2.9 billion, per capita 320 1988 real growth
