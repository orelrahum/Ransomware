So even and morn recorded the third day.
Again the Almighty spake, Let there be lights
High in the expanse of Heaven, to divide
The day from night and let them be for signs,
For seasons, and for days, and circling years
And let them be for lights, as I ordain
Their office in the firmament of Heaven,
To give light on the Earth and it was so.
And God made two great lights, great for their use
To Man, the greater to have rule by day,
