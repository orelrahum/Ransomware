:Saint Pierre and Miquelon Economy

Overview:
    The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by
    servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of Newfoundland. The
    economy has been declining, however, because the number of ships stopping at
    Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years. In March 1989, an
    agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pierres
    trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadianclaimed waters for three years.
    The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish
    exports to a halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports
    come primarily from Canada and France.

:Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture, dominated by banana production, is the most important sector of
    the economy. The services sector, based mostly on a growing tourist
    industry, is also important. The economy continues to have a high

    banana crop as a major export earner. Government progress toward
    diversifying into new industries has been relatively unsuccessful.
