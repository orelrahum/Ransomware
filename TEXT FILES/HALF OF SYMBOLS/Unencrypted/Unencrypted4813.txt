Overview:
    The economy, destroyed during the regime of former President Macias NGUEMA,
    is now based on agriculture, forestry, and fishing, which account for about
    half of GDP and nearly all exports. Subsistence agriculture predominates,
    with cocoa, coffee, and wood products providing income, foreign exchange,
    and government revenues. There is little industry. Commerce accounts for
    about 8 of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors for
    about 38. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore,
    manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place under
    concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately
    successful.
