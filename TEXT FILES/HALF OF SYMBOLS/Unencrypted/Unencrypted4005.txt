To answer, and resound far other song.
Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,
Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh,
Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed:
But her with stern regard he thus repelled.
Out of my sight, thou Serpent!  That name best
Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false
And hateful nothing wants, but that thy shape,
Like his, and colour serpentine, may show
Thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
Henceforth lest that too heavenly form, pretended
To hellish falshood, snare them!  But for thee
I had persisted happy had not thy pride
