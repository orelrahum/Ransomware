So dreadful to thee?  That thou art naked, who

Before my Judge either to undergo
Myself the total crime, or to accuse

However insupportable, be all
Devolved though should I hold my peace, yet thou
Wouldst easily detect what I conceal.

And gavest me as thy perfect gift, so good,
So fit, so acceptable, so divine,

And what she did, whatever in itself,
Her doing seemed to justify the deed
