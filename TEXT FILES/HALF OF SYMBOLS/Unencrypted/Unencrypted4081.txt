To that proud city, whose high walls thou sawest
Left in confusion Babylon thence called.
There in captivity he lets them dwell
The space of seventy years then brings them back,
Remembering mercy, and his covenant sworn
To David, stablished as the days of Heaven.
Returned from Babylon by leave of kings
Their lords, whom God disposed, the house of God
They first reedify and for a while
In mean estate live moderate till, grown
In wealth and multitude, factious they grow
But first among the priests dissention springs,
Men who attend the altar, and should most
Endeavour peace: their strife pollution brings
Upon the temple itself: at last they seise
The scepter, and regard not Davids sons
Then lose it to a stranger, that the true
Anointed King Messiah might be born
Barred of his right yet at his birth a star,
Unseen before in Heaven, proclaims him come
And guides the eastern sages, who inquire
