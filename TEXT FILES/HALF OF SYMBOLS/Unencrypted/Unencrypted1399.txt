:Azerbaijan Economy

Overview:
    Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia,
    the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in
    its majority Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and low
    standard of living. The economys most prominent products are cotton, oil,
    and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in decline
    for several years. With foreign assistance, the oil industry might generate
    the funds needed to spur industrial development. However, civil unrest,
    marked by armed conflict in the NagornoKarabakh region between Muslim
    Azeris and Christian Armenians, makes foreign investors wary. Azerbaijan
    accounts for 1.5 to 2 of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet
    Union. Although immediate economic prospects are not favorable because of
    civil strife, lack of economic reform, political disputes about new economic
    arrangements, and the skittishness of foreign investors, Azerbaijans
    economic performance was the best of all former Soviet republics in 1991
    largely because of its reliance on domestic resources for industrial output.

:The Bahamas Economy

Overview:
    The Bahamas is a stable, middleincome developing nation whose economy is
    based primarily on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism alone provides
    about 50 of GDP and directly or indirectly employs about 50,000 people or
    40 of the local work force. The economy has slackened in recent years, as
    the annual increase in the number of tourists slowed. Nonetheless, the per
    capita GDP of 9,900 is one of the highest in the region.

:Bahrain Economy

Overview:
    Petroleum production and processing account for about 80 of export
    receipts, 60 of government revenues, and 31 of GDP. Economic conditions
    have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of oil since 1985, for example,
    the Gulf crisis of 199091. The liberation of Kuwait in early 1991 has
    improved short to mediumterm prospects and has raised investors
    confidence. Bahrain with its highly developed communication and transport
    facilities is home to numerous multinational firms with business in the
    Gulf. A large share of exports is petroleum products made from imported
    crude.
