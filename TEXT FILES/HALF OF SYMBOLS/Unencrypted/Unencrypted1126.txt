:Portugal Economy

Overview:
    Although Portugal has experienced strong growth since joining the EC in 1986
     at least 4 each year through 1990  it remains one of the poorest
    members. To prepare for the European single market, the government is
    restructuring and modernizing the economy and in 1989 embarked on a major
    privatization program. The global slowdown and tight monetary policies to
    counter inflation caused growth to slow in 1991, but it is likely to recover
    in 1992.
