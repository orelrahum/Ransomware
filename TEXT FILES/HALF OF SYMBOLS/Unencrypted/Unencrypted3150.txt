	To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
	From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
	Here lived I, but now live here no more.
	At seventeen years many their fortunes seek
	But at fourscore it is too late a week:
	Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
	Than to die well and not my masters debtor.

ACT II



SCENE IV	The Forest of Arden.


	Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede, CELIA for Aliena,
	and TOUCHSTONE

ROSALIND	O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!

TOUCHSTONE	I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.

ROSALIND	I could find in my heart to disgrace my mans
	apparel and to cry like a woman but I must comfort
	the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show
