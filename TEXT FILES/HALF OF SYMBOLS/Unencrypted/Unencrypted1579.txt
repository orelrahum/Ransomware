knee, and looking at them with one eye I seem to see some
meaning in them, after all.  "SAID I COULD NOT SWIM" you
cant swim, can you? he added, turning to the Knave.

  The Knave shook his head sadly.  Do I look like it? he said.
Which he certainly did NOT, being made entirely of cardboard.

  All right, so far, said the King, and he went on muttering
over the verses to himself:  "WE KNOW IT TO BE TRUE" thats
the jury, of course "I GAVE HER ONE, THEY GAVE HIM TWO" why,
that must be what he did with the tarts, you know

  But, it goes on "THEY ALL RETURNED FROM HIM TO YOU," said
Alice.

  Why, there they are! said the King triumphantly, pointing to
the tarts on the table.  Nothing can be clearer than THAT.
Then again"BEFORE SHE HAD THIS FIT"  you never had fits, my
dear, I think? he said to the Queen.

  Never! said the Queen furiously, throwing an inkstand at the

Nobody moved.

  Who cares for you? said Alice, she had grown to her full
size by this time.  Youre nothing but a pack of cards!

  At this the whole pack rose up into the air, and came flying

the bank, with her head in the lap of her sister, who was gently
brushing away some dead leaves that had fluttered down from the
trees upon her face.

  Wake up, Alice dear! said her sister Why, what a long
sleep youve had!

  Oh, Ive had such a curious dream! said Alice, and she told
her sister, as well as she could remember them, all these strange
Adventures of hers that you have just been reading about and
when she had finished, her sister kissed her, and said, It WAS a
curious dream, dear, certainly:  but now run in to your tea its
