:Tajikistan Economy

Overview:
    Tajikistan has had the lowest standard of living and now faces the bleakest
    economic prospects of the 15 former Soviet republics. Agriculture is the
    main economic sector, normally accounting for 38 of employment and
    featuring cotton and fruits. Industry is sparse, bright spots including
    electric power and aluminum production based on the countrys sizable
    hydropower resources and a surprising specialty in the production of
    metalcutting machine tools. In 1991 and early 1992, disruptions in food
    supplies from the outside have severely strained the availability of food
    throughout the republic. The combination of the poor food supply, the
    general disruption of industrial links to suppliers and markets, and
    political instability have meant that the republics leadership could make
    little progress in economic reform in 1991 and early 1992.
