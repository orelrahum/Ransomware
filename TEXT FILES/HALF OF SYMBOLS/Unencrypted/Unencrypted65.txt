:Jersey Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and
    tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are
    important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy
    cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk
    products go to the UK and other EC countries. In 1986 the finance sector
    overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40 of the
    islands output. In recent years the government has encouraged light
    industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry
    has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw
    material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of
    Jerseys food needs.

    final status of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, their relationship with their
    neighbors, and a peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated
    among the concerned parties. The Camp David accords also specify that these
    negotiations will resolve the location of the respective boundaries. Pending
    the completion of this process, it is US policy that the final status of the
    West Bank and Gaza Strip has yet to be determined.

:Jordan Economy

Overview:
    Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the late
    1970s and early 1980s, when its annual GNP growth averaged more than 10. In
    the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in both Arab aid and worker
    remittances slowed economic growth to an average of roughly 2 per year.
    Imports  mainly oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food  have been
    outstripping exports, with the difference covered by aid, remittances, and
    borrowing. In mid1989, the Jordanian Government began debtrescheduling
    negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF program designed to gradually
    reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural reforms. The
    Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, aggravated Jordans
    already serious economic problems, forcing the government to shelve the IMF
    program, stop most debt payments, and suspend rescheduling negotiations. Aid
    from Gulf Arab states and worker remittances have plunged, and refugees have
    flooded the country, straining government resources. Economic recovery is
    unlikely without substantial foreign aid, debt relief, and economic reform.

Overview:
    The secondlargest in area of the 15 former Soviet republics, Kazakhstan has
    vast oil, coal, and agricultural resources. Kazakhstan is highly dependent
    on trade with Russia, exchanging its natural resources for finished consumer
    and industrial goods. Kazakhstan now finds itself with serious pollution
    problems, backward technology, and little experience in foreign markets. The
    government in 1991 pushed privatization of the economy at a faster pace than
    Russias program. The ongoing transitional period  marked by sharp
    inflation in wages and prices, lower output, lost jobs, and disruption of
    timehonored channels of supply  has brought considerable social unrest.
    Kazakhstan lacks the funds, technology, and managerial skills for a quick
    recovery of output. US firms have been enlisted to increase oil output but
    face formidable obstacles for example, oil can now reach Western markets
    only through pipelines that run across independent and sometimes
    unfriendly former Soviet republics. Finally, the end of monolithic
    Communist control has brought ethnic grievances into the open. The 6 million
    Russians in the republic, formerly the favored class, now face the hostility
    of a society dominated by Muslims. Ethnic rivalry will be just one of the
    formidable obstacles to the creation of a productive, technologically
    advancing society.
