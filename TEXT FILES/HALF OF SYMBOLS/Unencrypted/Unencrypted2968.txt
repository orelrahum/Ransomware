to know, but the Dodo had paused as if it thought that SOMEBODY
ought to speak, and no one else seemed inclined to say anything.

  Why, said the Dodo, the best way to explain it is to do it.
And, as you might like to try the thing yourself, some winter
day, I will tell you how the Dodo managed it.

  First it marked out a racecourse, in a sort of circle, the
exact shape doesnt matter, it said, and then all the party
were placed along the course, here and there.  There was no One,
two, three, and away, but they began running when they liked,
and left off when they liked, so that it was not easy to know
when the race was over.  However, when they had been running half
an hour or so, and were quite dry again, the Dodo suddenly called
out The race is over! and they all crowded round it, panting,
and asking, But who has won?
