Humbly their faults, and pardon begged with tears
Watering the ground, and with their sighs the air
Frequenting, sent from hearts contrite, in sign
Of sorrow unfeigned, and humiliation meek.
Thus they, in lowliest plight, repentant stood
Praying for from the mercyseat above
Prevenient grace descending had removed
The stony from their hearts, and made new flesh
Regenerate grow instead that sighs now breathed
Unutterable which the Spirit of prayer
Inspired, and winged for Heaven with speedier flight
Than loudest oratory:  Yet their port
Not of mean suitors nor important less
Seemed their petition, than when the ancient pair
In fables old, less ancient yet than these,
Deucalion and chaste Pyrrha, to restore
The race of mankind drowned, before the shrine
Of Themis stood devout.  To Heaven their prayers
Flew up, nor missed the way, by envious winds
Blown vagabond or frustrate: in they passed
Dimensionless through heavenly doors then clad
With incense, where the golden altar fumed,
By their great intercessour, came in sight
Before the Fathers throne: them the glad Son
Presenting, thus to intercede began.
See Father, what firstfruits on earth are sprung
From thy implanted grace in Man these sighs
And prayers, which in this golden censer mixed
With incense, I thy priest before thee bring
Fruits of more pleasing savour, from thy seed
Sown with contrition in his heart, than those
Which, his own hand manuring, all the trees
Of Paradise could have produced, ere fallen
From innocence.  Now therefore, bend thine ear
To supplication hear his sighs, though mute
Unskilful with what words to pray, let me
Interpret for him me, his advocate
And propitiation all his works on me,
Good, or not good, ingraft my merit those
Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.
Accept me and, in me, from these receive
The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live
Before thee reconciled, at least his days
Numbered, though sad till death, his doom, which I
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,
To better life shall yield him: where with me
All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss
Made one with me, as I with thee am one.
To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.
All thy request for Man, accepted Son,
Obtain all thy request was my decree:
But, longer in that Paradise to dwell,
The law I gave to Nature him forbids:
Those pure immortal elements, that know,
No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul,
Eject him, tainted now and purge him off,
As a distemper, gross, to air as gross,
And mortal food as may dispose him best
For dissolution wrought by sin, that first
