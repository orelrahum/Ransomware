For I no sooner in my heart divined,
My heart, which by a secret harmony
Still moves with thine, joined in connexion sweet,
That thou on earth hadst prospered, which thy looks
Now also evidence, but straight I felt,
Though distant from thee worlds between, yet felt,
That I must after thee, with this thy son
Such fatal consequence unites us three!
Hell could no longer hold us in our bounds,
Nor this unvoyageable gulf obscure
Detain from following thy illustrious track.
Thou hast achieved our liberty, confined
Within Hellgates till now thou us impowered
To fortify thus far, and overlay,
With this portentous bridge, the dark abyss.
Thine now is all this world thy virtue hath won
What thy hands builded not thy wisdom gained
With odds what war hath lost, and fully avenged
Our foil in Heaven here thou shalt monarch reign,
There didst not there let him still victor sway,
As battle hath adjudged from this new world
Retiring, by his own doom alienated
And henceforth monarchy with thee divide
