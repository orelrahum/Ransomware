Uzziel, half these draw off, and coast the south
With strictest watch these other wheel the north
Our circuit meets full west.  As flame they part,
Half wheeling to the shield, half to the spear.
From these, two strong and subtle Spirits he called
That near him stood, and gave them thus in charge.
Ithuriel and Zephon, with winged speed
Search through this garden, leave unsearched no nook
But chiefly where those two fair creatures lodge,
Now laid perhaps asleep, secure of harm.
