    The economy has been in decline for more than a decade with falling imports
    and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties stem from a sustained drop
    in copper production and ineffective economic policies. In 1991 real GDP
    fell by 2. An annual population growth of more than 3 has brought a
    decline in per capita GDP of 50 over the past decade. A high inflation rate
    has also added to Zambias economic woes in recent years.
