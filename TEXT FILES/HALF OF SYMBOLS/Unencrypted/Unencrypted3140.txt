ACT II



SCENE I	The Forest of Arden.


	Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,
	like foresters

DUKE SENIOR	Now, my comates and brothers in exile,
	Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
	Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
	More free from peril than the envious court?
	Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
	The seasons difference, as the icy fang
	And churlish chiding of the winters wind,
	Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
	Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
	This is no flattery: these are counsellors
	That feelingly persuade me what I am.
	Sweet are the uses of adversity,
	Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
	Wears yet a precious jewel in his head
	And this our life exempt from public haunt
	Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
	Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
	I would not change it.
