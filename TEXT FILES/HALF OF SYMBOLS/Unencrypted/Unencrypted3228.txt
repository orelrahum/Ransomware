	maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
	changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
	of thee than a Barbary cockpigeon over his hen,
	more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
	newfangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
	than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
	in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
	disposed to be merry I will laugh like a hyen, and
	that when thou art inclined to sleep.

ORLANDO	But will my Rosalind do so?
