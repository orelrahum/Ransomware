:Ireland Economy

Overview:
    The economy is small, open, and trade dependent. Agriculture, once the most
    important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37 of GDP
    and about 80 of exports and employs 26 of the labor force. The government
    has successfully reduced the rate of inflation from doubledigit figures in
    the late 1970s to 3.8 in 1991. In 1987, after years of deficits, the
    balance of payments was brought into the black. Unemployment, however,
    remains a serious problem. A 1991 unemployment rate of 20.4 placed Ireland
    along with Spain as the countries with the worst jobless records in Western
    Europe.
