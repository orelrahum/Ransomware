:Austria Economy

Overview:
    Austria boasts a prosperous and stable capitalist economy with a sizable
    proportion of nationalized industry and extensive welfare benefits. Thanks
    to an excellent raw material endowment, a technically skilled labor force,
    and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies specialized
    niches in European industry and services tourism, banking and produces
    almost enough food to feed itself with only 8 of the labor force in
    agriculture. Improved export prospects resulting from German unification and
    the opening of Eastern Europe, boosted the economy during 1990 and to a
    lesser extent in 1991. GDP growth slowed from 4.9 in 1990 to 3 in 1991 
    mainly due to the weaker world economy  and is expected to drop to around
    2 in 1992. Inflation is forecasted at about 4, while unemployment probably
    will increase moderately through 1992 before declining in 1993. Living
    standards are comparable with the large industrial countries of Western
    Europe. Problems for the l990s include an aging population, the high level
    of subsidies, and the struggle to keep welfare benefits within budget
    capabilities. Austria, which has applied for EC membership, was involved in
    EC and European Free Trade Association negotiations for a European Economic
    Area and will have to adapt its economy to achieve freer interchange of
    goods, services, capital, and labor within the EC.
