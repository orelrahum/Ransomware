With what is punished whence these raging fires
Will slacken, if his breath stir not their flames.
Our purer essence then will overcome

Familiar the fierce heat and, void of pain,
This horror will grow mild, this darkness light

For happy though but ill, for ill not worst,
If we procure not to ourselves more woe."

May hope, when everlasting Fate shall yield
To fickle Chance, and Chaos judge the strife.
The former, vain to hope, argues as vain
The latter for what place can be for us
Within Heavens bound, unless Heavens Lord supreme
We overpower? Suppose he should relent
And publish grace to all, on promise made
Of new subjection with what eyes could we
Stand in his presence humble, and receive
