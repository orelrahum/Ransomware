The heavens and all the constellations rung,
The planets in their station listening stood,
While the bright pomp ascended jubilant.
Open, ye everlasting gates! they sung,
Open, ye Heavens! your living doorslet in
The great Creator from his work returned
Magnificent, his six days work, a World
Open, and henceforth oft for God will deign
To visit oft the dwellings of just men,
Delighted and with frequent intercourse
Thither will send his winged messengers
On errands of supernal grace.  So sung
The glorious train ascending:  He through Heaven,
That opened wide her blazing portals, led
To Gods eternal house direct the way
A broad and ample road, whose dust is gold
And pavement stars, as stars to thee appear,
Seen in the galaxy, that milky way,
Which nightly, as a circling zone, thou seest
Powdered with stars.  And now on Earth the seventh
Evening arose in Eden, for the sun
Was set, and twilight from the east came on,
Forerunning night when at the holy mount
Of Heavens highseated top, the imperial throne
Of Godhead, fixed for ever firm and sure,
The Filial Power arrived, and sat him down
With his great Father for he also went
Invisible, yet staid, such privilege
Hath Omnipresence and the work ordained,
Author and End of all things and, from work
Now resting, blessed and hallowed the seventh day,
