:Arctic Ocean Geography

Total area:
    14,056,000 km2
Land area:
    14,056,000 km2 includes Baffin Bay, Barents Sea, Beaufort Sea, Chukchi Sea,
    East Siberian Sea, Greenland Sea, Hudson Bay, Hudson Strait, Kara Sea,
    Laptev Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Comparative area:
    slightly more than 1.5 times the size of the US smallest of the worlds
    four oceans after Pacific Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, and Indian Ocean
Coastline:
    45,389 km
Disputes:
    some maritime disputes see littoral states
Climate:
    persistent cold and relatively narrow annual temperature ranges winters
    characterized by continuous darkness, cold and stable weather conditions,
    and clear skies summers characterized by continuous daylight, damp and
    foggy weather, and weak cyclones with rain or snow
Terrain:
    central surface covered by a perennial drifting polar icepack that averages
    about 3 meters in thickness, although pressure ridges may be three times
    that size clockwise drift pattern in the Beaufort Gyral Stream, but nearly
    straight line movement from the New Siberian Islands Russia to Denmark
    Strait between Greenland and Iceland the ice pack is surrounded by open
    seas during the summer, but more than doubles in size during the winter and
    extends to the encircling land masses the ocean floor is about 50
    continental shelf highest percentage of any ocean with the remainder a
    central basin interrupted by three submarine ridges Alpha Cordillera,
    Nansen Cordillera, and Lomonsov Ridge maximum depth is 4,665 meters in the
    Fram Basin
Natural resources:
    sand and gravel aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, oil and
    gas fields, fish, marine mammals seals, whales
Environment:
    endangered marine species include walruses and whales ice islands
    occasionally break away from northern Ellesmere Island icebergs calved from
    glaciers in western Greenland and extreme northeastern Canada maximum snow
    cover in March or April about 20 to 50 centimeters over the frozen ocean and
    lasts about 10 months permafrost in islands virtually icelocked from
    October to June fragile ecosystem slow to change and slow to recover from
    disruptions or damage
Note:
    major chokepoint is the southern Chukchi Sea northern access to the Pacific
    Ocean via the Bering Strait ships subject to superstructure icing from
    October to May strategic location between North America and Russia
    shortest marine link between the extremes of eastern and western Russia,

:Arctic Ocean Economy

Overview:
    Economic activity is limited to the exploitation of natural resources,
    including crude oil, natural gas, fish, and seals.

Ports:

Telecommunications:
    no submarine cables
Note:
    sparse network of air, ocean, river, and land routes the Northwest Passage
    North America and Northern Sea Route Asia are important seasonal
    waterways
