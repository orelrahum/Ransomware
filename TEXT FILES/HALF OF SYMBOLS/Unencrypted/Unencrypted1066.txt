:Nauru Economy

Overview:
    Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are
    expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans
    one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World  10,000 annually.
    Few other resources exist, so most necessities must be imported, including
    fresh water from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the
    replacement of income from phosphates are serious longterm problems.
    Substantial amounts of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help
    cushion the transition.
