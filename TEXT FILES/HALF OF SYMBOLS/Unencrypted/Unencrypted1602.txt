	SONG.
	Who doth ambition shun

	All together here

	And loves to live i the sun,
	Seeking the food he eats
	And pleased with what he gets,
	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
	Here shall he see No enemy
	But winter and rough weather.

JAQUES	Ill give you a verse to this note that I made
	yesterday in despite of my invention.

AMIENS	And Ill sing it.

JAQUES	Thus it goes:

	If it do come to pass
	That any man turn ass,
	Leaving his wealth and ease,
	A stubborn will to please,
	Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
	Here shall he see
	Gross fools as he,
	An if he will come to me.

AMIENS	Whats that ducdame?

JAQUES	Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
	circle. Ill go sleep, if I can if I cannot, Ill
	rail against all the firstborn of Egypt.

AMIENS	And Ill go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.

	Exeunt severally

ACT II



SCENE VI	The forest.


	Enter ORLANDO and ADAM

ADAM	Dear master, I can go no further. O, I die for food!
	Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
	kind master.

ORLANDO	Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live
	a little comfort a little cheer thyself a little.
	If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I
	will either be food for it or bring it for food to
	thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
	For my sake be comfortable hold death awhile at
	the arms end: I will here be with thee presently
	and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
	give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
	come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
	thou lookest cheerly, and Ill be with thee quickly.
