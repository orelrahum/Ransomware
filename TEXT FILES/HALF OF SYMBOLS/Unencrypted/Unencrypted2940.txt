:Pacific Ocean Geography

Total area:
    165,384,000 km2
Land area:
    165,384,000 km2 includes Arafura Sea, Banda Sea, Bellingshausen Sea, Bering
    Sea, Bering Strait, Coral Sea, East China Sea, Gulf of Alaska, Makassar
    Strait, Philippine Sea, Ross Sea, Sea of Japan, Sea of Okhotsk, South China
    Sea, Tasman Sea, and other tributary water bodies
Comparative area:
    slightly less than 18 times the size of the US the largest ocean followed
    by the Atlantic Ocean, the Indian Ocean, and the Arctic Ocean covers about
    onethird of the global surface larger than the total land area of the
    world
Coastline:
    135,663 km
Disputes:
    some maritime disputes see littoral states
Climate:
    the western Pacific is monsoonal  a rainy season occurs during the summer
    months, when moistureladen winds blow from the ocean over the land, and a
    dry season during the winter months, when dry winds blow from the Asian land
    mass back to the ocean
Terrain:
    surface in the northern Pacific dominated by a clockwise, warmwater gyre
    broad, circular system of currents and in the southern Pacific by a
    counterclockwise, coolwater gyre sea ice occurs in the Bering Sea and Sea
    of Okhotsk during winter and reaches maximum northern extent from Antarctica
    in October the ocean floor in the eastern Pacific is dominated by the East
    Pacific Rise, while the western Pacific is dissected by deep trenches the
    worlds greatest depth is 10,924 meters in the Marianas Trench
Natural resources:
    oil and gas fields, polymetallic nodules, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
    deposits, fish
Environment:
    endangered marine species include the dugong, sea lion, sea otter, seals,
    turtles, and whales oil pollution in Philippine Sea and South China Sea
    dotted with low coral islands and rugged volcanic islands in the
    southwestern Pacific Ocean subject to tropical cyclones typhoons in
    southeast and east Asia from May to December most frequent from July to
    October tropical cyclones hurricanes may form south of Mexico and strike
    Central America and Mexico from June to October most common in August and
    September southern shipping lanes subject to icebergs from Antarctica
    occasional El Nino phenomenon occurs off the coast of Peru when the trade
    winds slacken and the warm Equatorial Countercurrent moves south, killing
    the plankton that is the primary food source for anchovies consequently,
    the anchovies move to better feeding grounds, causing resident marine birds
    to starve by the thousands because of their lost food source
Note:
    the major choke points are the Bering Strait, Panama Canal, Luzon Strait,
    and the Singapore Strait the Equator divides the Pacific Ocean into the
    North Pacific Ocean and the South Pacific Ocean ships subject to
    superstructure icing in extreme north from October to May and in extreme
    south from May to October persistent fog in the northern Pacific from June
    to December is a hazard to shipping surrounded by a zone of violent
    volcanic and earthquake activity sometimes referred to as the Pacific Ring
    of Fire

:Pacific Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Pacific Ocean is a major contributor to the world economy and
    particularly to those nations its waters directly touch. It provides cheap
    sea transportation between East and West, extensive fishing grounds,
    offshore oil and gas fields, minerals, and sand and gravel for the
    construction industry. In 1985 over half 54 of the worlds total fish
    catch came from the Pacific Ocean, which is the only ocean where the fish
    catch has increased every year since 1978. Exploitation of offshore oil and
    gas reserves is playing an everincreasing role in the energy supplies of
    Australia, New Zealand, China, US, and Peru. The high cost of recovering
    offshore oil and gas, combined with the wide swings in world prices for oil
    since 1985, has slowed but not stopped new drillings.

:Pakistan Economy

Overview:
    Pakistan is a poor Third World country faced with the usual problems of
    rapidly increasing population, sizable government deficits, and heavy
    dependence on foreign aid. In addition, the economy must support a large
    military establishment and provide for the needs of 4 million Afghan
    refugees. A real economic growth rate averaging 56 in recent years has
    enabled the country to cope with these problems. Almost all agriculture and
    smallscale industry is in private hands. In 1990, Pakistan embarked on a
    sweeping economic liberalization program to boost foreign and domestic
    private investment and lower foreign aid dependence. The SHARIF government
    has denationalized several stateowned firms and has attracted some foreign
    investment. Pakistan likely will have difficulty raising living standards
    because of its rapidly expanding population. At the current rate of growth,
    population would double in 25 years.

:Panama Economy

Overview:
    GDP expanded by roughly 9.3 in 1991, following growth of 4.6 in 1990 and a
    0.4 contraction in 1989. Delay in coming to terms with the international
    financial institutions on policies to implement structural reform in Panama
    generated uncertainty in the private sector and tempered the pace of
    business expansion in 1991. Public investment was limited as the
    administration kept the fiscal deficit below 3 of GDP. Unemployment and
    economic reform are the two major issues the government must face in
    199293.

:Papua New Guinea Economy

Overview:
    Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation
    has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of developing an
    infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85 of the
    population. Mining of numerous deposits, including copper and gold, accounts
    for about 60 of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and
    development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy.
    Robust growth in 1991 was led by the mining sector the opening of a large
    new gold mine featured in the advance.

:Paraguay Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25 of GDP, employs
    about 45 of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports. Paraguay has
    no known significant mineral or petroleum resources but does have a large
    hydropower potential. Since 1981 economic performance has declined compared
    with the boom period of 197681, when real GDP grew at an average annual
    rate of nearly 11. During the period 198286 real GDP fell in three of five
    years, inflation jumped to an annual rate of 32, and foreign debt rose.
    Factors responsible for the erratic behavior of the economy were the
    completion of the Itaipu hydroelectric dam, bad weather for crops, and weak
    international commodity prices for agricultural exports. In 1987 the economy
    experienced a minor recovery because of improved weather conditions and
    stronger international prices for key agricultural exports. The recovery
    continued through 1990, on the strength of bumper crops in 198889. In a
    major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in
    March 1991 joined the Southern Cone Common Market MERCOSUR, which includes
    Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. During 1991 the government began to more
    seriously address its arrearages with international creditors and its
    domestic fiscal problems. Inflation was cut in third, but the foreign trade
    deficit widened to more than 1 billion. For the long run, the government
    must press forward with general marketoriented economic reforms.

:Peru Economy

Overview:
    The Peruvian economy is becoming increasingly market oriented, with a large
    dose of government ownership remaining in mining, energy, and banking. In
    the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining per capita
    output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF and World
    Bank support in the mid1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An austerity
    program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took office in
    July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of economic
    activity, but the slide halted late in the year, and output rose 2.4 in
    1991. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program eliminated
    government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the
    singledigit level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since
    mid1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
    in September 1991, and, although it faces 14 billion in arrears on its
    external debt, is working to pay some 1.8 billion of these to the IMF and
    World Bank by 1993.

:Poland Economy

Overview:
    Poland is undergoing a difficult transition from a Sovietstyle economy 
    with state ownership and control of productive assets  to a market economy.
    On January 1, 1990, the new Solidarityled government implemented shock
    therapy by slashing subsidies, decontrolling prices, tightening the money
    supply, stabilizing the foreign exchange rate, lowering import barriers, and
    restraining state sector wages. As a result, consumer goods shortages and
    lines disappeared, and inflation fell from 640 in 1989 to 60 in 1991.
    Western governments, which hold twothirds of Polands 48 billion external
    debt, pledged in 1991 to forgive half of Polands official debt by 1994, and
    the private sector grew, accounting for 22 of industrial production and 40
    of nonagricultural output by 1991. Production fell in state enterprises,
    however, and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing
    in 1989 to 11.4 in December 1991. Poland fell out of compliance with its
    IMF program by mid1991, and talks with commercial creditors stalled. The
    increase in unemployment and the decline in living standards led to popular
    discontent and a change in government in January 1991 and again in December.
    The new government has promised selective industrial intervention, some
    relaxation in monetary policy, and an improved social safety net, but will
    be constrained by the decline in output and the growing budget deficit.

    members. To prepare for the European single market, the government is
    restructuring and modernizing the economy and in 1989 embarked on a major

:Puerto Rico Economy

Overview:
    Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean region.
    Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary sector of economic
    activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access to the US and by tax
    incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s.
    Important new industries include pharmaceuticals, electronics, textiles,
    petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar production has lost out to dairy
    production and other livestock products as the main source of income in the
    agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been an important source of
    income for the island. The economy has largely recovered from the
    disruptions caused by Hurricane Hugo in September 1989. The tourism
    infrastructure has been especially hard hit.

:Qatar Economy

Overview:
    Oil is the backbone of the economy and accounts for more than 85 of export
    earnings and roughly 75 of government revenues. Proved oil reserves of 3.3
    billion barrels should ensure continued output at current levels for about
    25 years. Oil has given Qatar a per capita GDP of about 15,000, comparable
    to the leading industrial countries. Production and export of natural gas is

:Reunion Economy

Overview:
    The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Sugarcane has been
    the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts for
    85 of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a tourist
    industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to onethird
    of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the welloff and the poor is
    extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and
    Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the
    population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups
    suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the
    African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991
    illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic
    wellbeing of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from
    France.

:Romania Economy

Overview:
    Industry, which accounts for about onethird of the labor force and
    generates over half the GDP, suffers from an aging capital plant and
    persistent shortages of energy. The year 1991 witnessed about a 17 drop in
    industrial production because of energy and input shortages and labor
    unrest. In recent years the agricultural sector has had to contend with
    flooding, mismanagement, shortages of inputs, and disarray caused by the
    dismantling of cooperatives. A shortage of fuel and equipment in 1991
    contributed to a lackluster harvest, a problem compounded by corruption and
    a poor distribution system. The new government is loosening the tight
    central controls of CEAUSESCUS command economy. It has instituted moderate
    land reforms, with more than onehalf of cropland now in private hands, and
    it has liberalized private agricultural output. Also, the new regime is
    permitting the establishment of private enterprises, largely in services,
    handicrafts, and smallscale industry. A law providing for the privatization
    of large state firms has been passed. Most of the large state firms have
    been converted into jointstock companies, but the selling of shares and
    assets to private owners has been delayed. While the government has halted
    the old policy of diverting food from domestic consumption to hard currency
    export markets, supplies remain scarce in some areas. Furthermore, real
    wages in Romania fell about 20 in 1991, contributing to the unrest which
    forced the resignation of ROMAN in September. The new government continues
    to impose price ceilings on key consumer items.

:Russia Economy

Overview:
    Russia, one of the worlds largest economies, possesses a wealth of natural
    resources and a diverse industrial base. Within the nowdismantled USSR, it
    had produced 60 of total output, with 55 of the total labor force and 60
    of the total capital stock. Russia depends on its worldclass deposits of
    oil and gas not only for its own needs but also for vital hard currency
    earnings. Selfsufficient in coal and iron ore, it has a crude steel
    production capacity of about 95 million tons, second only to Japan. Russias
    machinebuilding sector  60 of the old USSRs  lags behind world
    standards of efficiency and quality of product. Other major industrial
    sectors  chemicals, construction materials, light industry, and food
    processing  also suffer from quality problems, obsolescent capital
    equipment, and pollution. Consumer goods have had lower priority, and the
    product mix has not mirrored household preferences. Furthermore, the
    transition to a more marketoriented economy has disrupted channels of
    supply to factories and distribution outlets substantial imports of foods
    and medical supplies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption.
    Russia inherited 70 of the former USSRs defense production facilities and
    is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these
    plants to civilian production. Russia produces almost half of the old USSRs
    farm products, but most warmclimate crops must be imported. Under the old
    USSR, production of industrial and agricultural goods often was concentrated
    in a single firm or a single republic. Today, producing units often have
    lost their major customers and their major sources of supply, and the market
    institutions and incentives for adjusting to the new political and economic
    situations are only slowly emerging. Rankandfile Russians will continue to
    suffer major deprivations in 1992 and beyond before the country begins to
    realize its great economic potential. The comprehensive economic reform
    program enacted in January 1992 faces many economic and political hurdles
    before it will lead to sustained economic growth.

:Rwanda Economy

Overview:
    Almost 50 of GDP comes from the agricultural sector coffee and tea make up
    8090 of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, however, and
    deforestation and soil erosion have created problems. The industrial sector
    in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17 to GDP. Manufacturing focuses
    mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The Rwandan economy
    remains dependent on coffee exports and foreign aid. Weak international
    prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and per capita GDP to
    decline. A structural adjustment program with the World Bank began in
    October 1990. An outbreak of insurgency, also in October, has dampened any
    prospects for economic improvement.

:Saint Lucia Economy

Overview:
    Since 1983 the economy has shown an impressive average annual growth rate of
    almost 5 because of strong agricultural and tourist sectors. Saint Lucia
    also possesses an expanding industrial base supported by foreign investment
    in manufacturing and other activities, such as in data processing. The
    economy, however, remains vulnerable because the important agricultural
    sector is dominated by banana production. Saint Lucia is subject to periodic
    droughts andor tropical storms, and its protected market agreement with the
    UK for bananas may end in 1992.

:Saint Pierre and Miquelon Economy

Overview:
    The inhabitants have traditionally earned their livelihood by fishing and by
    servicing fishing fleets operating off the coast of Newfoundland. The
    economy has been declining, however, because the number of ships stopping at
    Saint Pierre has dropped steadily over the years. In March 1989, an
    agreement between France and Canada set fish quotas for Saint Pierres
    trawlers fishing in Canadian and Canadianclaimed waters for three years.
    The agreement settles a longstanding dispute that had virtually brought fish
    exports to a halt. The islands are heavily subsidized by France. Imports
    come primarily from Canada and France.
