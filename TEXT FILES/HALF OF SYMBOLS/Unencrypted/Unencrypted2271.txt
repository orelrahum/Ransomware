Overview:
    Guyana is one of the worlds poorest countries with a per capita income less
    than onefifth the South American average. After growing on average at less
    than 1 a year in 198687, GDP dropped by 5 a year in 198890. The decline
    resulted from bad weather, labor trouble in the canefields, and flooding and
    equipment problems in the bauxite industry. Consumer prices rose about 100
    in 1989 and 75 in 1990, and the current account deficit widened
    substantially as sugar and bauxite exports fell. Moreover, electric power is
    in short supply and constitutes a major barrier to future gains in national
    output. The government, in association with international financial
    agencies, seeks to reduce its payment arrears and to raise new funds. The
    governments stabilization program  aimed at establishing realistic
    exchange rates, reasonable price stability, and a resumption of growth 
    requires considerable public administrative abilities and continued patience
    by consumers during a long incubation period. In 1991, buoyed by a recovery
    in mining and agriculture, the economy posted 6 growth, according to
    official figures. A large volume of illegal and quasi legal economic
    activity is not captured in estimates of the countrys total output.
