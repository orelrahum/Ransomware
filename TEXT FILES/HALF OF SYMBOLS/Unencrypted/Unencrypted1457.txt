:Macedonia Economy

Overview:
    Macedonia, although the poorest among the six republics of a disintegrated
    Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and energy needs through its own
    agricultural and coal resources. As a breakaway republic, however, it will
    move down toward a bare subsistence level of life unless economic ties are
    reforged or enlarged with its neighbors Serbia, Albania, Greece, and
    Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside sources for all of its oil and gas
    and its modern machinery and parts. Continued political turmoil, both
    internally and in the region as a whole, prevents any swift readjustments of
    trade patterns and economic rules of the game. Inflation in early 1992 was
    out of control, the result of fracturing trade links, the decline in
    economic activity, and general uncertainties about the future status of the
    country prices rose 38 in March 1992 alone. Macedonias geographical
    isolation, technological backwardness, and political instability place it
    far down the list of countries of interest to Western investors. Recognition
    of Macedonia by the EC and an internal commitment to economic reform would
    help to encourage foreign investment over the long run.

:Madagascar Economy

Overview:
    Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world. Agriculture,
    including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of the economy, accounting
    for over 40 of GDP, employing about 80 of the labor force, and
    contributing to more than 70 of total export earnings. Industry is largely
    confined to the processing of agricultural products and textile
    manufacturing in 1990 it accounted for only 16 of GDP and employed almost
    5 of the labor force. In 1986 the government introduced a fiveyear
    development plan that stressed selfsufficiency in food mainly rice by
    1990, increased production for exports, and reduced energy imports. After
    mid1991, however, output dropped sharply because of protracted
    antigovernment strikes and demonstrations for political reform.
