The universe, and to each inward part
With gentle penetration, though unseen,
Shoots invisible virtue even to the deep
So wonderously was set his station bright.
There lands the Fiend, a spot like which perhaps
Astronomer in the suns lucent orb
Through his glazed optick tube yet never saw.
The place he found beyond expression bright,
Compared with aught on earth, metal or stone
Not all parts like, but all alike informed
With radiant light, as glowing iron with fire
If metal, part seemed gold, part silver clear
If stone, carbuncle most or chrysolite,
