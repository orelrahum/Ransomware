:Botswana Economy

Overview:
    The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops.
    Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80 of the population,
    but produces only about 50 of food needs. The driving force behind the
    rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining industry.
    This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from generating
    25 of GDP in 1980 to over 50 in 1989. No other sector has experienced such
    growth, especially not agriculture, which is plagued by erratic rainfall and
    poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 25. Although diamond
    production remained level in FY91, substantial gains in coal output and
    manufacturing helped boost the economy
