:Germany Economy

Overview:
    The Federal Republic of Germany is making substantial progress in
    integrating and modernizing eastern Germany, but at a heavy economic cost.
    Western Germanys growth in 1991 slowed to 3.1  the lowest rate since 1987
     because of slack world growth and higher interest rates and taxes required
    by the unification process. While western Germanys economy was in recession
    in the last half of 1991, eastern Germanys economy bottomed out after a
    nearly twoyear freefall and shows signs of recovery, particularly in the
    construction, transportation, and service sectors. Eastern Germany could
    begin a fragile recovery later, concentrated in 1992 in construction,
    transportation, and services. The two regions remain vastly different,
    however, despite eastern Germanys progress. Western Germany has an advanced
    market economy and is a world leader in exports. It has a highly urbanized
    and skilled population that enjoys excellent living standards, abundant
    leisure time, and comprehensive social welfare benefits. Western Germany is
    relatively poor in natural resources, coal being the most important mineral.
    Western Germanys worldclass companies manufacture technologically advanced
    goods. The regions economy is mature: services and manufacturing account
    for the dominant share of economic activity, and raw materials and
    semimanufactured goods constitute a large portion of imports. In recent
    years, manufacturing has accounted for about 31 of GDP, with other sectors
    contributing lesser amounts. Gross fixed investment in 1990 accounted for
