His place of birth a solemn Angel tells
To simple shepherds, keeping watch by night
They gladly thither haste, and by a quire
Of squadroned Angels hear his carol sung.
A virgin is his mother, but his sire
The power of the Most High:  He shall ascend
The throne hereditary, and bound his reign
With Earths wide bounds, his glory with the Heavens.
He ceased, discerning Adam with such joy
