:Argentina Economy

Overview:
    Argentina is rich in natural resources and has a highly literate population,
    an exportoriented agricultural sector, and a diversified industrial base.
    Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and statist policies, the
    economy has encountered major problems in recent years, leading to
    escalating inflation and a recession during 198890. Since 1978, Argentinas
    external debt has nearly doubled to 58 billion, creating severe debt
    servicing difficulties and hurting the countrys creditworthiness with
    international lenders. Elected in 1989, President Menem has implemented a
    comprehensive economic restructuring program that shows signs of reversing
    Argentinas economic decline and putting it on a path of stable, sustainable
    growth.

:Armenia Economy

Overview:
    Armenia under the old centrally planned Soviet system had built up textile,
    machinebuilding, and other industries and had become a key supplier to
    sister republics. In turn, Armenia had depended on supplies of raw materials
    and energy from the other republics. Most of these supplies enter the
    republic by rail through Azerbaijan 85 and Georgia 15. The economy has
    been severely hurt by ethnic strife with Azerbaijan over control of the
    NagornoKarabakh Autonomous Oblast, a mostly Armenianpopulated enclave
    within the national boundaries of Azerbaijan. In addition to outright
    warfare, the strife has included interdiction of Armenian imports on the
    Azerbaijani railroads and expensive airlifts of supplies to beleagured
    Armenians in NagornoKarabakh. An earthquake in December 1988 destroyed
    about onetenth of industrial capacity and housing, the repair of which has
    not been possible because the supply of funds and real resources has been
    disrupted by the reorganization and subsequent dismantling of the central
    USSR administrative apparatus. Among facilities made unserviceable by the
    earthquake are the Yerevan nuclear power plant, which had supplied 40 of
    Armenias needs for electric power and a plant that produced onequarter of
    the output of elevators in the former USSR. Armenia has some deposits of
    nonferrous metal ores bauxite, copper, zinc, and molybdenum that are
    largely unexploited. For the midterm, Armenias economic prospects seem
    particularly bleak because of ethnic strife and the unusually high
    dependence on outside areas, themselves in a chaotic state of
    transformation.

:Aruba Economy

Overview:
    Tourism is the mainstay of the economy, although offshore banking and oil
    refining and storage are also important. Hotel capacity expanded rapidly
    between 1985 and 1989 and nearly doubled in 1990 alone. Unemployment has
    steadily declined from about 20 in 1986 to about 3 in 1991. The reopening
    of the local oil refinery, once a major source of employment and foreign
    exchange earnings, promises to give the economy an additional boost.
