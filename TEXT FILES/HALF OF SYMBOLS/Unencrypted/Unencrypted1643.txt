	Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
	With measure heapd in joy, to the measures fall.

JAQUES	Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
	The duke hath put on a religious life
	And thrown into neglect the pompous court?

JAQUES DE BOYS	He hath.

JAQUES	To him will I : out of these convertites
	There is much matter to be heard and learnd.

	To DUKE SENIOR

	You to your former honour I bequeath
	Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:

	To ORLANDO

	You to a love that your true faith doth merit:

	To OLIVER

	You to your land and love and great allies:

	To SILVIUS

	You to a long and welldeserved bed:

	To TOUCHSTONE

	And you to wrangling for thy loving voyage
	Is but for two months victualld. So, to your pleasures:
	I am for other than for dancing measures.

DUKE SENIOR	Stay, Jaques, stay.

JAQUES	To see no pastime I	what you would have
	Ill stay to know at your abandond cave.

	Exit

DUKE SENIOR	Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
	As we do trust theyll end, in true delights.

	A dance

	EPILOGUE


ROSALIND	It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue
	but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
	the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
	no bush, tis true that a good play needs no
	epilogue yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
	and good plays prove the better by the help of good
	epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am
	neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
	you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
	furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
	become me: my way is to conjure you and Ill begin
