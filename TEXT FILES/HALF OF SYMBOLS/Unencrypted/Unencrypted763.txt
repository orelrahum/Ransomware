:The Bahamas Economy

Overview:
    The Bahamas is a stable, middleincome developing nation whose economy is
    based primarily on tourism and offshore banking. Tourism alone provides
    about 50 of GDP and directly or indirectly employs about 50,000 people or
    40 of the local work force. The economy has slackened in recent years, as
    the annual increase in the number of tourists slowed. Nonetheless, the per
    capita GDP of 9,900 is one of the highest in the region.
