Among the groves, the fountains, and the flowers
That open now their choisest bosomed smells,
Reserved from night, and kept for thee in store.
So cheered he his fair spouse, and she was cheered
But silently a gentle tear let fall
From either eye, and wiped them with her hair
Two other precious drops that ready stood,
Each in their crystal sluice, he ere they fell
Kissed, as the gracious signs of sweet remorse
And pious awe, that feared to have offended.
So all was cleared, and to the field they haste.
But first, from under shady arborous roof
Soon as they forth were come to open sight
Of dayspring, and the sun, who, scarce uprisen,
With wheels yet hovering oer the oceanbrim,
Shot parallel to the earth his dewy ray,
Discovering in wide landskip all the east
Of Paradise and Edens happy plains,
Lowly they bowed adoring, and began
Their orisons, each morning duly paid
In various style for neither various style
Nor holy rapture wanted they to praise
Their Maker, in fit strains pronounced, or sung
Unmeditated such prompt eloquence
Flowed from their lips, in prose or numerous verse,
More tuneable than needed lute or harp
