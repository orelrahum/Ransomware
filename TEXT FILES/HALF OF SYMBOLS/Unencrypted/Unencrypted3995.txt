And season him thy last and sweetest prey.
This said, they both betook them several ways,
Both to destroy, or unimmortal make
All kinds, and for destruction to mature
Sooner or later which the Almighty seeing,
From his transcendent seat the Saints among,
To those bright Orders uttered thus his voice.
See, with what heat these dogs of Hell advance
To waste and havock yonder world, which I
So fair and good created and had still
Kept in that state, had not the folly of Man
Let in these wasteful furies, who impute
Folly to me so doth the Prince of Hell
And his adherents, that with so much ease
I suffer them to enter and possess
A place so heavenly and, conniving, seem
To gratify my scornful enemies,
That laugh, as if, transported with some fit
Of passion, I to them had quitted all,
At random yielded up to their misrule
And know not that I called, and drew them thither,
My Hellhounds, to lick up the draff and filth
Which Mans polluting sin with taint hath shed
On what was pure til, crammed and gorged, nigh burst
With sucked and glutted offal, at one sling
Of thy victorious arm, wellpleasing Son,
Both Sin, and Death, and yawning Grave, at last,
Through Chaos hurled, obstruct the mouth of Hell
For ever, and seal up his ravenous jaws.
Then Heaven and Earth renewed shall be made pure
