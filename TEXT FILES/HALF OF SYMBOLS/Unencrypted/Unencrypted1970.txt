Overview:
    Tourism is the mainstay of the economy, although offshore banking and oil
    refining and storage are also important. Hotel capacity expanded rapidly
    between 1985 and 1989 and nearly doubled in 1990 alone. Unemployment has
    steadily declined from about 20 in 1986 to about 3 in 1991. The reopening
    of the local oil refinery, once a major source of employment and foreign
    exchange earnings, promises to give the economy an additional boost.
