:Morocco Economy

Overview:
    The economy had recovered moderately in 1990 because of: the resolution of a
    trade dispute with India over phosphoric acid sales, a rebound in textile
    sales to the EC, lower prices for food imports, a sharp increase in worker
    remittances, increased Arab donor aid, and generous debt rescheduling
    agreements. Economic performance in 1991 was mixed. A record harvest helped
    real GDP advance by 4.2, although nonagricultural output grew by less than
    1. Inflation accelerated slightly as easier financial policies triggered
    rapid credit and monetary growth. Despite recovery of domestic demand,
    import volume growth slowed while export volume was adversely affected by
    phosphate marketing difficulties. In January 1992, Morocco reached a new
    12month standby arrangement for 129 million with the IMF. In February
    1992, the Paris Club rescheduled 1.4 billion of Moroccos commercial debt.
    This is thought to be Moroccos last rescheduling. By 1993 the Moroccan
    authorities hope to be in a position to meet all debt service obligations
    without additional rescheduling. Servicing this large debt, high
    unemployment, and Moroccos vulnerability to external economic forces remain
    severe longterm problems.
GDP:
