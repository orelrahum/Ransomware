:Russia Economy

Overview:
    Russia, one of the worlds largest economies, possesses a wealth of natural
    resources and a diverse industrial base. Within the nowdismantled USSR, it
    had produced 60 of total output, with 55 of the total labor force and 60
    of the total capital stock. Russia depends on its worldclass deposits of
    oil and gas not only for its own needs but also for vital hard currency
    earnings. Selfsufficient in coal and iron ore, it has a crude steel
    production capacity of about 95 million tons, second only to Japan. Russias
    machinebuilding sector  60 of the old USSRs  lags behind world
    standards of efficiency and quality of product. Other major industrial
    sectors  chemicals, construction materials, light industry, and food
    processing  also suffer from quality problems, obsolescent capital
    equipment, and pollution. Consumer goods have had lower priority, and the
    product mix has not mirrored household preferences. Furthermore, the
    transition to a more marketoriented economy has disrupted channels of
    supply to factories and distribution outlets substantial imports of foods
    and medical supplies have helped maintain minimum standards of consumption.
    Russia inherited 70 of the former USSRs defense production facilities and
    is experiencing major social problems during conversion of many of these
