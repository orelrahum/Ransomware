ROSALIND	So was I when your highness took his dukedom
	So was I when your highness banishd him:
	Treason is not inherited, my lord
	Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
	Whats that to me? my father was no traitor:
	Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
	To think my poverty is treacherous.

CELIA	Dear sovereign, hear me speak.

DUKE FREDERICK	Ay, Celia we stayd her for your sake,
	Else had she with her father ranged along.

CELIA	I did not then entreat to have her stay
	It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
	I was too young that time to value her
	But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
	Why so am I we still have slept together,
	Rose at an instant, learnd, playd, eat together,
	And wheresoever we went, like Junos swans,
	Still we went coupled and inseparable.

DUKE FREDERICK	She is too subtle for thee and her smoothness,
	Her very silence and her patience
	Speak to the people, and they pity her.
	Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name
	And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
	When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
	Firm and irrevocable is my doom
	Which I have passd upon her she is banishd.

CELIA	Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
	I cannot live out of her company.
