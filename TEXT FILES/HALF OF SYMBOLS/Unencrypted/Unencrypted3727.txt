But all these shining orbs his choice to dwell
That I may find him, and with secret gaze
Or open admiration him behold,
On whom the great Creator hath bestowed
Worlds, and on whom hath all these graces poured
That both in him and all things, as is meet,
The universal Maker we may praise
Who justly hath driven out his rebel foes
To deepest Hell, and, to repair that loss,
Created this new happy race of Men
To serve him better:  Wise are all his ways.
So spake the false dissembler unperceived
For neither Man nor Angel can discern
Hypocrisy, the only evil that walks
