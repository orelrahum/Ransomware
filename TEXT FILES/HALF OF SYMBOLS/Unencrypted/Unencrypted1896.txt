Wholesome, and cool, and mild, but with black air
Accompanied with damps, and dreadful gloom
Which to his evil conscience represented
All things with double terrour:  On the ground
Outstretched he lay, on the cold ground and oft
Cursed his creation  Death as oft accused
Of tardy execution, since denounced
The day of his offence.  Why comes not Death,
Said he, with one thriceacceptable stroke
To end me?  Shall Truth fail to keep her word,
Justice Divine not hasten to be just?
But Death comes not at call Justice Divine
Mends not her slowest pace for prayers or cries,
O woods, O fountains, hillocks, dales, and bowers!
With other echo late I taught your shades
To answer, and resound far other song.
Whom thus afflicted when sad Eve beheld,
Desolate where she sat, approaching nigh,
Soft words to his fierce passion she assayed:
But her with stern regard he thus repelled.
Out of my sight, thou Serpent!  That name best
Befits thee with him leagued, thyself as false
And hateful nothing wants, but that thy shape,
Like his, and colour serpentine, may show
Thy inward fraud to warn all creatures from thee
Henceforth lest that too heavenly form, pretended
To hellish falshood, snare them!  But for thee
I had persisted happy had not thy pride
And wandering vanity, when least was safe,
Rejected my forewarning, and disdained
Not to be trusted longing to be seen,
Though by the Devil himself him overweening
To overreach but, with the serpent meeting,
Fooled and beguiled by him thou, I by thee
To trust thee from my side imagined wise,
Constant, mature, proof against all assaults
And understood not all was but a show,
Rather than solid virtue all but a rib
Crooked by nature, bent, as now appears,
More to the part sinister, from me drawn
Well if thrown out, as supernumerary
To my just number found.  O! why did God,
Creator wise, that peopled highest Heaven
With Spirits masculine, create at last
This novelty on earth, this fair defect
Of nature, and not fill the world at once
With Men, as Angels, without feminine
Or find some other way to generate
Mankind?  This mischief had not been befallen,
And more that shall befall innumerable
Disturbances on earth through female snares,
And strait conjunction with this sex: for either
He never shall find out fit mate, but such
As some misfortune brings him, or mistake
Or whom he wishes most shall seldom gain
Through her perverseness, but shall see her gained
By a far worse or, if she love, withheld
By parents or his happiest choice too late
Shall meet, already linked and wedlockbound
