:Benin Economy

Overview:
    Benin is one of the least developed countries in the world because of
    limited natural resources and a poorly developed infrastructure. Agriculture
    accounts for about 35 of GDP, employs about 60 of the labor force, and
    generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings. The industrial sector
    contributes only about 15 to GDP and employs 2 of the work force. Low
    prices in recent years have kept down hard currency earnings from Benins
    major exports of agricultural products and crude oil.

:Bhutan Economy

Overview:
    The economy, one of the worlds least developed, is based on agriculture and
    forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90 of the population and
    account for about 50 of GDP. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make
    the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The
    economy is closely aligned with that of India through strong trade and
    monetary links. Low wages in industry lead most Bhutanese to stay in
    agriculture. Most development projects, such as road construction, rely on
    Indian migrant labor. Bhutans hydropower potential and its attraction for
    tourists are its most important natural resources.
