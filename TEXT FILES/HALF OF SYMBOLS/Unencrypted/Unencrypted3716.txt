The builders next of Babel on the plain
Of Sennaar, and still with vain design,
New Babels, had they wherewithal, would build:
Others came single he, who, to be deemed
A God, leaped fondly into Aetna flames,
Empedocles and he, who, to enjoy
Platos Elysium, leaped into the sea,
Cleombrotus and many more too long,
Embryos, and idiots, eremites, and friars
White, black, and gray, with all their trumpery.
Here pilgrims roam, that strayed so far to seek
In Golgotha him dead, who lives in Heaven
And they, who to be sure of Paradise,
Dying, put on the weeds of Dominick,
Or in Franciscan think to pass disguised
They pass the planets seven, and pass the fixed,
And that crystalling sphere whose balance weighs
The trepidation talked, and that first moved
And now Saint Peter at Heavens wicket seems
To wait them with his keys, and now at foot
