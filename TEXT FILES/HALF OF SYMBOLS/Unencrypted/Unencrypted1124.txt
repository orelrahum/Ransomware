:Poland Economy

Overview:
    Poland is undergoing a difficult transition from a Sovietstyle economy 
    with state ownership and control of productive assets  to a market economy.
    On January 1, 1990, the new Solidarityled government implemented shock
    therapy by slashing subsidies, decontrolling prices, tightening the money
    supply, stabilizing the foreign exchange rate, lowering import barriers, and
    restraining state sector wages. As a result, consumer goods shortages and
    lines disappeared, and inflation fell from 640 in 1989 to 60 in 1991.
    Western governments, which hold twothirds of Polands 48 billion external
    debt, pledged in 1991 to forgive half of Polands official debt by 1994, and
    the private sector grew, accounting for 22 of industrial production and 40
    of nonagricultural output by 1991. Production fell in state enterprises,
    however, and the unemployment rate climbed steadily from virtually nothing
    in 1989 to 11.4 in December 1991. Poland fell out of compliance with its
    IMF program by mid1991, and talks with commercial creditors stalled. The
    increase in unemployment and the decline in living standards led to popular
    discontent and a change in government in January 1991 and again in December.
    The new government has promised selective industrial intervention, some
    relaxation in monetary policy, and an improved social safety net, but will
    be constrained by the decline in output and the growing budget deficit.
