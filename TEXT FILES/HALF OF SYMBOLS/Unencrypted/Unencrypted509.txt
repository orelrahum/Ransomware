ROSALIND	You tell us the manner of the wrestling.

LE BEAU	I will tell you the beginning and, if it please
	your ladyships, you may see the end for the best is
	yet to do and here, where you are, they are coming
	to perform it.

CELIA	Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.

LE BEAU	There comes an old man and his three sons,

CELIA	I could match this beginning with an old tale.

LE BEAU	Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.

ROSALIND	With bills on their necks, Be it known unto all men
	by these presents.

LE BEAU	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
	dukes wrestler which Charles in a moment threw him
	and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
	hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
	so the third. Yonder they lie the poor old man,
	their father, making such pitiful dole over them
	that all the beholders take his part with weeping.

ROSALIND	Alas!

TOUCHSTONE	But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
	have lost?
