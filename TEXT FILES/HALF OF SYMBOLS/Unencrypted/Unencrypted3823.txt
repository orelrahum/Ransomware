Of erring, from the path of truth remote:
Unjustly thou depravest it with the name
Of servitude, to serve whom God ordains,
Or Nature:  God and Nature bid the same,
When he who rules is worthiest, and excels
Them whom he governs.  This is servitude,
To serve the unwise, or him who hath rebelled
Against his worthier, as thine now serve thee,
Thyself not free, but to thyself enthralled
Yet lewdly darest our ministring upbraid.
Reign thou in Hell, thy kingdom let me serve
In Heaven God ever blest, and his divine
Behests obey, worthiest to be obeyed
Yet chains in Hell, not realms, expect:  Mean while
From me returned, as erst thou saidst, from flight,
