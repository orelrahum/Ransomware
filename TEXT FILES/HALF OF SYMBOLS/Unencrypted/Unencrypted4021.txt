To supplication hear his sighs, though mute
Unskilful with what words to pray, let me
Interpret for him me, his advocate
And propitiation all his works on me,
Good, or not good, ingraft my merit those
Shall perfect, and for these my death shall pay.
Accept me and, in me, from these receive
The smell of peace toward mankind: let him live
Before thee reconciled, at least his days
Numbered, though sad till death, his doom, which I
To mitigate thus plead, not to reverse,
To better life shall yield him: where with me
All my redeemed may dwell in joy and bliss
Made one with me, as I with thee am one.
To whom the Father, without cloud, serene.
All thy request for Man, accepted Son,
Obtain all thy request was my decree:
But, longer in that Paradise to dwell,
The law I gave to Nature him forbids:
Those pure immortal elements, that know,
No gross, no unharmonious mixture foul,
Eject him, tainted now and purge him off,
As a distemper, gross, to air as gross,
And mortal food as may dispose him best
For dissolution wrought by sin, that first
Distempered all things, and of incorrupt
Corrupted.  I, at first, with two fair gifts
Created him endowed with happiness,
And immortality: that fondly lost,
This other served but to eternize woe
Till I provided death: so death becomes
His final remedy and, after life,
Tried in sharp tribulation, and refined
