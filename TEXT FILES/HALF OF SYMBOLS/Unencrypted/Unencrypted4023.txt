O Sons, like one of us Man is become
To know both good and evil, since his taste
Of that defended fruit but let him boast
His knowledge of good lost, and evil got
Happier! had it sufficed him to have known
Good by itself, and evil not at all.
He sorrows now, repents, and prays contrite,
My motions in him longer than they move,
His heart I know, how variable and vain,
Selfleft.  Lest therefore his now bolder hand
Reach also of the tree of life, and eat,
And live for ever, dream at least to live
For ever, to remove him I decree,
And send him from the garden forth to till
The ground whence he was taken, fitter soil.
Michael, this my behest have thou in charge
Take to thee from among the Cherubim
Thy choice of flaming warriours, lest the Fiend,
Or in behalf of Man, or to invade
Vacant possession, some new trouble raise:
Haste thee, and from the Paradise of God
Without remorse drive out the sinful pair
From hallowed ground the unholy and denounce
To them, and to their progeny, from thence
Perpetual banishment.  Yet, lest they faint
At the sad sentence rigorously urged,
For I behold them softened, and with tears
Bewailing their excess, all terrour hide.
If patiently thy bidding they obey,
Dismiss them not disconsolate reveal
To Adam what shall come in future days,
As I shall thee enlighten intermix
My covenant in the Womans seed renewed
So send them forth, though sorrowing, yet in peace:
