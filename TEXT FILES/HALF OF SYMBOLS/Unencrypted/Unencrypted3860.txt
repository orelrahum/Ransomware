Our knowing, as to highest wisdom seemed,
Deign to descend now lower, and relate
What may no less perhaps avail us known,
How first began this Heaven which we behold
Distant so high, with moving fires adorned
Innumerable and this which yields or fills
All space, the ambient air wide interfused
Embracing round this floried Earth what cause
Moved the Creator, in his holy rest
Through all eternity, so late to build
In Chaos and the work begun, how soon
Absolved if unforbid thou mayest unfold
What we, not to explore the secrets ask
Of his eternal empire, but the more
To magnify his works, the more we know.
And the great light of day yet wants to run
Much of his race though steep suspense in Heaven,
