From a fat meadow ground or fleecy flock,
Ewes and their bleating lambs over the plain,
Their booty scarce with life the shepherds fly,
But call in aid, which makes a bloody fray
With cruel tournament the squadrons join
Where cattle pastured late, now scattered lies
With carcasses and arms the ensanguined field,
Deserted:  Others to a city strong
Lay siege, encamped by battery, scale, and mine,
Assaulting others from the wall defend
With dart and javelin, stones, and sulphurous fire
On each hand slaughter, and gigantick deeds.
In other part the sceptered heralds call
To council, in the citygates anon
Grayheaded men and grave, with warriours mixed,
Assemble, and harangues are heard but soon,
In factious opposition till at last,
Of middle age one rising, eminent
In wise deport, spake much of right and wrong,
Of justice, or religion, truth, and peace,
And judgement from above: him old and young
Exploded, and had seized with violent hands,
Had not a cloud descending snatched him thence
Unseen amid the throng: so violence
Proceeded, and oppression, and swordlaw,
Through all the plain, and refuge none was found.
Adam was all in tears, and to his guide
Lamenting turned full sad O!what are these,
Deaths ministers, not men? who thus deal death
Inhumanly to men, and multiply
Ten thousandfold the sin of him who slew
His brother: for of whom such massacre
Make they, but of their brethren men of men
But who was that just man, whom had not Heaven
Rescued, had in his righteousness been lost?
To whom thus Michael.  These are the product
Of those illmated marriages thou sawest
Where good with bad were matched, who of themselves
Abhor to join and, by imprudence mixed,
Produce prodigious births of body or mind.
Such were these giants, men of high renown
For in those days might only shall be admired,
And valour and heroick virtue called
To overcome in battle, and subdue
Nations, and bring home spoils with infinite
Manslaughter, shall be held the highest pitch
Of human glory and for glory done
Of triumph, to be styled great conquerours
Patrons of mankind, Gods, and sons of Gods
Destroyers rightlier called, and plagues of men.
Thus fame shall be achieved, renown on earth
And what most merits fame, in silence hid.
But he, the seventh from thee, whom thou beheldst
The only righteous in a world preverse,
And therefore hated, therefore so beset
With foes, for daring single to be just,
And utter odious truth, that God would come
To judge them with his Saints him the Most High
Rapt in a balmy cloud with winged steeds
Did, as thou sawest, receive, to walk with God
