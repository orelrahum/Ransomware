:Syria Economy

Overview:
    Syrias statedominated Bathist economy has benefited from the Gulf war,
    increased oil production, good weather, and economic deregulation. Economic
    growth averaged nearly 12 annually in 199091, buoyed by increased oil
    production and improved agricultural performance. The Gulf war of early 1991
    provided Syria an aid windfall of several billion dollars from Arab,
    European, and Japanese donors. These inflows more than offset Damascuss
    warrelated costs and will help Syria cover some of its debt arrears,
    restore suspended credit lines, and initiate selected military and civilian
    purchases. For the long run, Syrias economy is still saddled with a large
    number of poorly performing public sector firms investment levels remain
    low and industrial and agricultural productivity is poor. A major longterm
    concern is the additional drain of upstream Euphrates water by Turkey when
    its vast dam and irrigation projects are completed by middecade.
