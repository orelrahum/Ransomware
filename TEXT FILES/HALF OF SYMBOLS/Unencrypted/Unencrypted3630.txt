Whom thunder hath made greater? Here at least
We shall be free th Almighty hath not built
Here for his envy, will not drive us hence:
Here we may reigh secure and, in my choice,
To reign is worth ambition, though in Hell:
Better to reign in Hell than serve in Heaven.
But wherefore let we then our faithful friends,
Th associates and copartners of our loss,
Lie thus astonished on th oblivious pool,
And call them not to share with us their part
In this unhappy mansion, or once more
With rallied arms to try what may be yet
