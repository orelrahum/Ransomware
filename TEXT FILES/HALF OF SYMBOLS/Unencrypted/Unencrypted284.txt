:Finland Economy

Overview:
    Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market economy, with per
    capita output nearly threefourths the US figure. Its main economic force is
    the manufacturing sector  principally the wood, metals, and engineering
    industries. Trade is important, with the export of goods representing about
    30 of GDP. Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on
    imported raw materials, energy, and some components of manufactured goods.
    Because of the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining
    selfsufficiency in basic commodities. The economy, which experienced an
    average of 4.9 annual growth between 1987 and 1989, sank into a deep
    recession in 1991 as growth contracted by 6.2. The recession  which is
    expected to bottom out in late 1992  has been caused by economic
    overheating, depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter
    system between Finland and the former Soviet Union in which Soviet oil and
    gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish
    Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and
