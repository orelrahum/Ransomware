:Dominican Republic Economy

Overview:
    The economy is largely dependent on trade imported components average 60
    of the value of goods consumed in the domestic market. Rapid growth of free
    trade zones has established a significant expansion of manufacturing for
    export, especially wearing apparel. Over the past decade, tourism has also
    increased in importance and is a major earner of foreign exchange and a
    source of new jobs. Agriculture remains a key sector of the economy. The
    principal commercial crop is sugarcane, followed by coffee, cotton, cocoa,
    and tobacco. Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural
    products, durable consumer goods, minerals, and chemicals. Unemployment is
    officially reported at about 30, but there is considerable underemployment.
    A fiscal austerity program has brought inflation under control, but in 1991
    the economy contracted for a second straight year.

:Ecuador Economy

Overview:
    Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas. Growth
    has been uneven because of natural disasters for example, a major
    earthquake in 1987, fluctuations in global oil prices, and government
    policies designed to curb inflation. The government has not taken a
    supportive attitude toward either domestic or foreign investment, although
    its agreement to enter the Andean free trade zone is an encouraging move. As
    1991 ended, Ecuador received a standby IMF loan of 105 million, which will
    permit the country to proceed with the rescheduling of Paris Club debt.

:Egypt Economy

Overview:
    Egypt has one of the largest public sectors of all the Third World
    economies, most industrial plants being owned by the government.
    Overregulation holds back technical modernization and foreign investment.
    Even so, the economy grew rapidly during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but
    in 1986 the collapse of world oil prices and an increasingly heavy burden of
    debt servicing led Egypt to begin negotiations with the IMF for
    balanceofpayments support. As part of the 1987 agreement with the IMF, the
    government agreed to institute a reform program to reduce inflation, promote
    economic growth, and improve its external position. The reforms have been
    slow in coming, however, and the economy has been largely stagnant for the
    past four years. The addition of 1 million people every seven months to
    Egypts population exerts enormous pressure on the 5 of the total land area
    available for agriculture.
