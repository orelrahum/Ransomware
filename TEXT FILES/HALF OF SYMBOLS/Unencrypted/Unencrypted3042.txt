  I dont think they play at all fairly, Alice began, in rather
a complaining tone, and they all quarrel so dreadfully one cant
hear oneself speakand they dont seem to have any rules in
particular at least, if there are, nobody attends to themand
youve no idea how confusing it is all the things being alive
for instance, theres the arch Ive got to go through next
walking about at the other end of the groundand I should have
croqueted the Queens hedgehog just now, only it ran away when it
saw mine coming!

  How do you like the Queen? said the Cat in a low voice.

  Not at all, said Alice:  shes so extremely  Just then
she noticed that the Queen was close behind her, listening:  so
she went on, likely to win, that its hardly worth while
