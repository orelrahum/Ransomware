Reflecting blaze on blaze, first met his view:
War he perceived, war in procinct and found
Already known what he for news had thought
To have reported:  Gladly then he mixed
Among those friendly Powers, who him received
With joy and acclamations loud, that one,
That of so many myriads fallen, yet one
Returned not lost.  On to the sacred hill
They led him high applauded, and present
Before the seat supreme from whence a voice,
From midst a golden cloud, thus mild was heard.
Servant of God. Well done well hast thou fought
The better fight, who single hast maintained
Against revolted multitudes the cause
Of truth, in word mightier than they in arms
And for the testimony of truth hast borne
Universal reproach, far worse to bear
Than violence for this was all thy care
To stand approved in sight of God, though worlds
