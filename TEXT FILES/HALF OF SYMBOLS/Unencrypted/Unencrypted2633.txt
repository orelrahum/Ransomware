Overview:
    Agriculture, dominated by banana production, is the most important sector of
    the economy. The services sector, based mostly on a growing tourist
    industry, is also important. The economy continues to have a high
    unemployment rate of 30 because of an overdependence on the weatherplagued
    banana crop as a major export earner. Government progress toward
    diversifying into new industries has been relatively unsuccessful.
