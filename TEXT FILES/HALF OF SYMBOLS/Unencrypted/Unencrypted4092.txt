That ye may live, which will be many days,
Both in one faith unanimous, though sad,
With cause, for evils past yet much more cheered
With meditation on the happy end.
He ended, and they both descend the hill
Descended, Adam to the bower, where Eve
Lay sleeping, ran before but found her waked
And thus with words not sad she him received.
Whence thou returnest, and whither wentest, I know
For God is also in sleep and dreams advise,
Which he hath sent propitious, some great good
Presaging, since with sorrow and hearts distress
Wearied I fell asleep:  But now lead on
In me is no delay with thee to go,
Is to stay here without thee here to stay,
Is to go hence unwilling thou to me
Art all things under Heaven, all places thou,
Who for my wilful crime art banished hence.
This further consolation yet secure
I carry hence though all by me is lost,
Such favour I unworthy am vouchsafed,
By me the Promised Seed shall all restore.
So spake our mother Eve and Adam heard
Well pleased, but answered not:  For now, too nigh
The ArchAngel stood and, from the other hill
To their fixed station, all in bright array
