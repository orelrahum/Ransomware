With shivered armour strown, and on a heap
Chariot and charioteer lay overturned,
And fieryfoaming steeds what stood, recoiled
Oerwearied, through the faint Satanick host
Defensive scarce, or with pale fear surprised,
Then first with fear surprised, and sense of pain,
Fled ignominious, to such evil brought
By sin of disobedience till that hour
Not liable to fear, or flight, or pain.
