:Chile Economy

Overview:
    The government of President Aylwin, which took power in 1990, has opted to
    retain the orthodox economic policies of Pinochet, although the share of
    spending for social welfare has risen slightly. In 1991 growth in GDP
    recovered to 5.5 led by consumer spending after only 2.1 growth in 1990.
    The tight monetary policy of 1990 helped cut the rate of inflation from
    27.3 in 1990 to 18.7 in 1991. Despite a 12 drop in copper prices, the
    trade surplus rose in 1991, and international reserves increased.
    Inflationary pressures are not expected to ease much in 1992, and economic
    growth is likely to approach 7.
