    The economy, centrally planned and largely state owned, is highly dependent
    on the agricultural sector and foreign trade. Sugar provided about
    twothirds of export revenues in 1991, and over half was exported to the
    former Soviet republics. The economy has stagnated since 1985 under policies
    that have deemphasized material incentives in the workplace, abolished
    farmers informal produce markets, and raised prices of governmentsupplied
    goods and services. In 1990 the economy probably fell 5 largely as a result
    of declining trade with the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe. Recently
    the government has been trying to increase trade with Latin America and
    China. Cuba has had difficulty servicing its foreign debt since 1982. The
    government currently is encouraging foreign investment in tourist facilities
    and in industrial plants idled by falling imports from the former Soviet
    Union. Other investment priorities include sugar, basic foods, and nickel.
    The annual Soviet subsidy dropped from 4 billion in 1990 to about 1
    billion in 1991 because of a lower price paid for Cuban sugar and a sharp
    decline in Soviet exports to Cuba. The former Soviet republics have
    indicated they will no longer extend aid to Cuba beginning in 1992. Instead
    of highly subsidized trade, Cuba has been shifting to trade at market prices
    in convertible currencies. Because of increasingly severe shortages of
    fuels, industrial raw materials, and spare parts, aggregate output dropped
    by onefifth in 1991.
