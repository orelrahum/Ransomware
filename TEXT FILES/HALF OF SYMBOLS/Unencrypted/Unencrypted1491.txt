:Somalia Economy

Overview:
    One of the worlds poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has few
    resources. Agriculture is the most important sector of the economy, with the
    livestock sector accounting for about 40 of GDP and about 65 of export
    earnings. Nomads and seminomads who are dependent upon livestock for their
    livelihoods make up more than half of the population. Crop production
    generates only 10 of GDP and employs about 20 of the work force. The main
    export crop is bananas sugar, sorghum, and corn are grown for the domestic
    market. The small industrial sector is based on the processing of
    agricultural products and accounts for less than 10 of GDP. Greatly
    increased political turmoil in 199192 has resulted in a substantial drop in
    output, with widespread famine a grim fact of life.

:South Africa Economy

Overview:
    Many of the white oneseventh of the South African population enjoy incomes,
    material comforts, and health and educational standards equal to those of
    Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from
    the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment, lack of job
    skills, and barriers to movement into higherpaying fields. Inputs and
    outputs thus do not move smoothly into the most productive employments, and
    the effectiveness of the market is further lowered by international
    constraints on dealings with South Africa. The main strength of the economy
    lies in its rich mineral resources, which provide twothirds of exports.
    Average growth of less than 2 in output in recent years falls far short of
    the 5 to 6 level needed to absorb some 300,000 new entrants to the labor
    force annually. Economic developments in the 1990s will be driven partly by
    the changing relations among the various ethnic groups.
