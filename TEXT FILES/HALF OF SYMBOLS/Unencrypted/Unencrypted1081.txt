    agricultural and industrial firms remain state owned. Sandinista economic
    policies and the war had produced a severe economic crisis. The foundation
    of the economy continues to be the export of agricultural commodities,
    largely coffee and cotton. Farm production fell by roughly 7 in 1989 and 4
    in 1990, and remained about even in 1991. The agricultural sector employs
    44 of the work force and accounts for 15 of GDP and 80 of export
    earnings. Industry, which employs 13 of the work force and contributes
    about 25 to GDP, showed a drop of 7 in 1989, fell slightly in 1990, and
    remained flat in 1991 output still is below pre1979 levels. External debt
    is one of the highest in the world on a per capita basis. In 1991 the
    inflation rate was 766, down sharply from the 13,490 of 1990.
