More grateful, to their supperfruits they fell,
Nectarine fruits which the compliant boughs
Yielded them, sidelong as they sat recline
On the soft downy bank damasked with flowers:
The savoury pulp they chew, and in the rind,
Still as they thirsted, scoop the brimming stream
Nor gentle purpose, nor endearing smiles
Wanted, nor youthful dalliance, as beseems
Fair couple, linked in happy nuptial league,
Alone as they.  About them frisking played
All beasts of the earth, since wild, and of all chase
In wood or wilderness, forest or den
Sporting the lion ramped, and in his paw
Dandled the kid bears, tigers, ounces, pards,
Gambolled before them the unwieldy elephant,
To make them mirth, used all his might, and wreathed
His?kithetmroboscis close the serpent sly,
Insinuating, wove with Gordian twine
His braided train, and of his fatal guile
Gave proof unheeded others on the grass
Couched, and now filled with pasture gazing sat,
Or bedward ruminating for the sun,
Declined, was hasting now with prone career
