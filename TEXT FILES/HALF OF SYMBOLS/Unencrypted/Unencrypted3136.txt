	If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
	And in the greatness of my word, you die.

	Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords

CELIA	O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
	Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
	I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.

ROSALIND	I have more cause.

CELIA	                  Thou hast not, cousin
	Prithee be cheerful: knowst thou not, the duke
	Hath banishd me, his daughter?

ROSALIND	That he hath not.
