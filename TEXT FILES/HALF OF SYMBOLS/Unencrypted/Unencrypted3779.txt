Such whispering waked her, but with startled eye
On Adam, whom embracing, thus she spake.
O sole in whom my thoughts find all repose,
My glory, my perfection! glad I see
Thy face, and morn returned for I this night
Such night till this I never passed have dreamed,
If dreamed, not, as I oft am wont, of thee,
Works of day past, or morrows next design,
But of offence and trouble, which my mind
Knew never till this irksome night:  Methought,
Close at mine ear one called me forth to walk
With gentle voice  I thought it thine: It said,
Why sleepest thou, Eve? now is the pleasant time,
The cool, the silent, save where silence yields
To the nightwarbling bird, that now awake
