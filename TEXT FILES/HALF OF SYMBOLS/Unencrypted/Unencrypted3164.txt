	And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
	And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot
	And thereby hangs a tale. When I did hear
	The motley fool thus moral on the time,
	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
	That fools should be so deepcontemplative,
	And I did laugh sans intermission
	An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
	A worthy fool! Motleys the only wear.

DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?

JAQUES	O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
	And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
	They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
	After a voyage, he hath strange places crammd
	With observation, the which he vents
	In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
	I am ambitious for a motley coat.

DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one.
