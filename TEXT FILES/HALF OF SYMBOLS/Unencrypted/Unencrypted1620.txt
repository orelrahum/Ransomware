CELIA	Was is not is: besides, the oath of a lover is
	no stronger than the word of a tapster they are
	both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
	here in the forest on the duke your father.

ROSALIND	I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
	him: he asked me of what parentage I was I told
	him, of as good as he so he laughed and let me go.
	But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
	man as Orlando?

CELIA	O, thats a brave man! he writes brave verses,
	speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
	them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
	his lover as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
	but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
	goose: but alls brave that youth mounts and folly
	guides. Who comes here?

	Enter CORIN

CORIN	Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
	After the shepherd that complaind of love,
	Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
	Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
	That was his mistress.

CELIA	Well, and what of him?

CORIN	If you will see a pageant truly playd,
	Between the pale complexion of true love
	And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
	Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
	If you will mark it.

ROSALIND	O, come, let us remove:
	The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
	Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
	Ill prove a busy actor in their play.

	Exeunt




	AS YOU LIKE IT


ACT III



SCENE V	Another part of the forest.


	Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE

SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me do not, Phebe
	Say that you love me not, but say not so
	In bitterness. The common executioner,
	Whose heart the accustomd sight of death makes hard,
	Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
	But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
