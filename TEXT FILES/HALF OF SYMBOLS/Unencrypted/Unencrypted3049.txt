  I dare say youre wondering why I dont put my arm round your
waist, the Duchess said after a pause:  the reason is, that Im
doubtful about the temper of your flamingo.  Shall I try the
experiment?

  HE might bite, Alice cautiously replied, not feeling at all
anxious to have the experiment tried.

  Very true, said the Duchess:  flamingoes and mustard both
bite.  And the moral of that is"Birds of a feather flock
together."

  Only mustard isnt a bird, Alice remarked.

  Right, as usual, said the Duchess:  what a clear way you
have of putting things!

  Its a mineral, I THINK, said Alice.

  Of course it is, said the Duchess, who seemed ready to agree
to everything that Alice said theres a large mustardmine near
here.  And the moral of that is"The more there is of mine, the
less there is of yours."
