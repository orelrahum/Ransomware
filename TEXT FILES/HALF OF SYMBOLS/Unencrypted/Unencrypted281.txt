:Ethiopia Economy

Overview:
    Ethiopia is one of the poorest and least developed countries in Africa. Its
    economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which accounts for about 45 of
    GDP, 90 of exports, and 80 of total employment coffee generates 60 of
    export earnings. The manufacturing sector is heavily dependent on inputs
    from the agricultural sector. Over 90 of largescale industry, but less
    than 10 of agriculture, is state run the government is considering selling
    off a portion of stateowned plants. Favorable agricultural weather largely
    explains the 4.5 growth in output in FY89, whereas drought and
    deteriorating internal security conditions prevented growth in FY90. In 1991
    the lack of law and order, particularly in the south, interfered with
    economic development and growth.
