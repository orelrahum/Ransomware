:Gibraltar Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends heavily on British defense expenditures, revenue from
    tourists, fees for services to shipping, and revenues from banking and
    finance activities. Because more than 70 of the economy is in the public
    sector, changes in government spending have a major impact on the level of
    employment. Construction workers are particularly affected when government
    expenditures are cut.
