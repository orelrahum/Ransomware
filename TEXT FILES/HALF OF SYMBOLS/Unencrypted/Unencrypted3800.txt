That is, to thy obedience therein stand.
This was that caution given thee be advised.
God made thee perfect, not immutable
And good he made thee, but to persevere
He left it in thy power ordained thy will
By nature free, not overruled by fate
Inextricable, or strict necessity:
Our voluntary service he requires,
Not our necessitated such with him
Finds no acceptance, nor can find for how
Can hearts, not free, be tried whether they serve
Willing or no, who will but what they must
By destiny, and can no other choose?
Myself, and all the angelick host, that stand
In sight of God, enthroned, our happy state
Hold, as you yours, while our obedience holds
On other surety none:  Freely we serve,
Because we freely love, as in our will
To love or not in this we stand or fall:
And some are fallen, to disobedience fallen,
And so from Heaven to deepest Hell O fall
From what high state of bliss, into what woe!
To whom our great progenitor.  Thy words
Attentive, and with more delighted ear,
Divine instructer, I have heard, than when
Cherubick songs by night from neighbouring hills
Aereal musick send:  Nor knew I not
To be both will and deed created free
Yet that we never shall forget to love
Our Maker, and obey him whose command
Single is yet so just, my constant thoughts
