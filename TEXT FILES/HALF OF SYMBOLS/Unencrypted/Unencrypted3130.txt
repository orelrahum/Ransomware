	Which of the two was daughter of the duke
	That here was at the wrestling?

LE BEAU	Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners
	But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
	The other is daughter to the banishd duke,
	And here detaind by her usurping uncle,
	To keep his daughter company whose loves
	Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
	But I can tell you that of late this duke
	Hath taen displeasure gainst his gentle niece,
	Grounded upon no other argument
	But that the people praise her for her virtues
	And pity her for her good fathers sake
	And, on my life, his malice gainst the lady
	Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
	Hereafter, in a better world than this,
	I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.

ORLANDO	I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.

	Exit LE BEAU
