CELIA	All the better we shall be the more marketable.

	Enter LE BEAU

	Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: whats the news?

LE BEAU	Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.

CELIA	Sport! of what colour?

LE BEAU	What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?

ROSALIND	As wit and fortune will.

TOUCHSTONE	Or as the Destinies decree.

CELIA	Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.

TOUCHSTONE	Nay, if I keep not my rank,

ROSALIND	Thou losest thy old smell.

LE BEAU	You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
	wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.

ROSALIND	You tell us the manner of the wrestling.

LE BEAU	I will tell you the beginning and, if it please
	your ladyships, you may see the end for the best is
	yet to do and here, where you are, they are coming
	to perform it.

CELIA	Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
