:Sweden Economy

Overview:
    Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I through
    World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a
    mixed system of hightech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. It has
    essentially full employment, a modern distribution system, excellent
    internal and external communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber,
    hydropower, and iron ore constitute the resource base of an economy that is
    heavily oriented toward foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for
    about 90 of industrial output, of which the engineering sector accounts for
    50 of output and exports. In the last few years, however, this
    extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by inflation, growing
    absenteeism, and a gradual loss of competitiveness in international markets.
    The new centerright government, facing a sagging economic situation which
    is unlikely to improve until 1993, is pushing full steam ahead with economic
    reform proposals to end Swedens recession and to prepare for possible EC
    membership in 1995. The freemarketoriented reforms are designed to spur
    growth, maintain price stability, lower unemployment, create a more
    efficient welfare state, and further adapt to EC standards. The measures
    include: cutting taxes, particularly the valueadded tax VAT and levies on
    new and small business privatization liberalizing foreign ownership
    restrictions and opening the welfare system to competition and private
    alternatives, which the government will still finance. Growth is expected to
    remain flat in 1992, but increase slightly in 1993, while inflation should
    remain around 3 for the next few years. On the down side, unemployment may
    climb to slightly over 4 in 1993, and the budget deficit will reach nearly
    9 billion in 1992.
