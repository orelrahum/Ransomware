:Cape Verde Economy

Overview:
    Cape Verdes low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base, a
    17year drought, and a high birthrate. The economy is service oriented, with
    commerce, transport, and public services accounting for 65 of GDP during
    the period 198588. Although nearly 70 of the population lives in rural
    areas, agricultures share of GDP is only 16 the fishing sector accounts
    for 4. About 90 of food must be imported. The fishing potential, mostly
    lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. In 1988 fishing represented only
    3.5 of GDP. Cape Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by
    remittances from emigrants and foreign aid. Economic reforms launched by the
    new democratic government in February 1991 are aimed at developing the
    private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify the economy.
