:Czechoslovakia Economy

Overview:
    Czechoslovakia is highly industrialized by East European standards and has a
    welleducated and skilled labor force. GDP per capita has been the highest
    in Eastern Europe. Annual GDP growth slowed to less than 1 percent during
    the 198590 period. The country is deficient in energy and in many raw
    materials. Moreover, its aging capital plant lags well behind West European
    standards. In January 1991, Prague launched a sweeping program to convert
    its almost entirely stateowned and controlled economy to a market system.
    The koruna now enjoys almost full internal convertibility and over 90 of
    prices are set by the market. The government is planning to privatize all
    small businesses and roughly twothirds of large enterprises by the end of
    1993. New privatesector activity is also expanding. Agriculture  95
    socialized  is to be privatized by the end of 1992. Reform has taken its
    toll on the economy: inflation was roughly 50 in 1991, unemployment was
    nearly 70, and GDP dropped an estimated 15. In 1992 the government is
    anticipating inflation of 1015, unemployment of 1112, and a drop in GDP
    of up to 8. As of mid1992, the nation appears to be splitting in two 
    into the industrial Czech area and the more agarian Slovak area.
