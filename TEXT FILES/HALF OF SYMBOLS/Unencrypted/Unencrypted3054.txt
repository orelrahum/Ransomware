see after some executions I have ordered and she walked off,
leaving Alice alone with the Gryphon.  Alice did not quite like
the look of the creature, but on the whole she thought it would
be quite as safe to stay with it as to go after that savage
Queen:  so she waited.

  The Gryphon sat up and rubbed its eyes:  then it watched the
Queen till she was out of sight:  then it chuckled.  What fun!
said the Gryphon, half to itself, half to Alice.

  What IS the fun? said Alice.

  Why, SHE, said the Gryphon.  Its all her fancy, that:  they
never executes nobody, you know.  Come on!

  Everybody says "come on!" here, thought Alice, as she went
slowly after it:  I never was so ordered about in all my life,
never!
