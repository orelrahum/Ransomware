Total area:
    14,000,000 km2 est.
Land area:
    about 14,000,000 km2
Comparative area:
    slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US secondsmallest continent
    after Australia
Land boundaries:
    none, but see entry on Disputes
Coastline:
    17,968 km
Maritime claims:
    none, but see entry on Disputes
Disputes:
    Antarctic Treaty defers claims see Antarctic Treaty Summary below
    sections some overlapping claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France
    Adelie Land, New Zealand Ross Dependency, Norway Queen Maud Land, and
    UK the US and Russia do not recognize the territorial claims of other
    nations and have made no claims themselves but reserve the right to do so
    no formal claims have been made in the sector between 90. west and 150.
    west, where, because of floating ice, Antarctica is unapproachable from the
    sea
Climate:
    severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the
    ocean East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher
    elevation Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate higher
    temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below
    freezing
Terrain:
    about 98 thick continental ice sheet and 2 barren rock, with average
    elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters mountain ranges up to 4,897
    meters high icefree coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land,
    Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and Ross Island on McMurdo Sound
    glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, and floating
    ice shelves constitute 11 of the area of the continent
Natural resources:
    none presently exploited iron, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, platinum,
    and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small,
    uncommercial quantities
Land use:
    no arable land and no plant growth ice 98, barren rock 2
Environment:
    mostly uninhabitable katabatic gravitydriven winds blow coastward from
    the high interior frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau a
    circumpolar ocean current flows clockwise along the coast as do cyclonic
    storms that form over the ocean during summer more solar radiation reaches
    the surface at the South Pole than is received at the Equator in an
    equivalent period in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield,
    which protects the Earths surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had
    dwindled to its lowest level ever over Antarctica active volcanism on
    Deception Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica other seismic
    activity rare and weak
