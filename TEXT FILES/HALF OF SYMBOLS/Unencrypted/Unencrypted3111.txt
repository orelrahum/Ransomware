OLIVER	What, you wrestle tomorrow before the new duke?

CHARLES	Marry, do I, sir and I came to acquaint you with a
	matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
	to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
	Tomorrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit and he that
	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
	well. Your brother is but young and tender and,
	for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
	must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
	out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
	withal, that either you might stay him from his
	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
	run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
	and altogether against my will.

OLIVER	Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
	thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
	myself notice of my brothers purpose herein and
	have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
	it, but he is resolute. Ill tell thee, Charles:
	it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
	of ambition, an envious emulator of every mans
	good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
	me his natural brother: therefore use thy
	discretion I had as lief thou didst break his neck
	as his finger. And thou wert best look tot for if
	thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
	mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
