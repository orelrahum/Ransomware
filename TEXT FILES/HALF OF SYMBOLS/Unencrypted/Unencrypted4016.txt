Immediate dissolution, which we thought
Was meant by death that day when lo!to thee
Pains only in childbearing were foretold,
And bringing forth soon recompensed with joy,
Fruit of thy womb:  On me the curse aslope
Glanced on the ground with labour I must earn
My bread what harm? Idleness had been worse
My labour will sustain me and, lest cold
Or heat should injure us, his timely care
Hath, unbesought, provided and his hands
Clothed us unworthy, pitying while he judged
How much more, if we pray him, will his ear
Be open, and his heart to pity incline,
And teach us further by what means to shun
The inclement seasons, rain, ice, hail, and snow!
Which now the sky, with various face, begins
