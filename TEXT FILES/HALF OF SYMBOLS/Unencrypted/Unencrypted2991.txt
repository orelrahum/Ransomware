  It isnt, said the Caterpillar.

  Well, perhaps you havent found it so yet, said Alice but
when you have to turn into a chrysalisyou will some day, you
knowand then after that into a butterfly, I should think youll
feel it a little queer, wont you?

  Not a bit, said the Caterpillar.

  Well, perhaps your feelings may be different, said Alice
all I know is, it would feel very queer to ME.

  You! said the Caterpillar contemptuously.  Who are YOU?

  Which brought them back again to the beginning of the
conversation.  Alice felt a little irritated at the Caterpillars
making such VERY short remarks, and she drew herself up and said,
very gravely, I think, you ought to tell me who YOU are, first.

  Why? said the Caterpillar.

  Here was another puzzling question and as Alice could not
think of any good reason, and as the Caterpillar seemed to be in
a VERY unpleasant state of mind, she turned away.

  Come back! the Caterpillar called after her.  Ive something
important to say!

  This sounded promising, certainly:  Alice turned and came back
again.
