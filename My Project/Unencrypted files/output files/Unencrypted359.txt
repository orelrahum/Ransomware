:Kenya Economy

Overview:
    Kenya's 3.6% annual population growth rate - one of the highest in the world
    - presents a serious problem for the country's economy. In the meantime, GDP
    growth in the near term has kept slightly ahead of population - annually
    averaging 4.9% in the 1986-90 period. Undependable weather conditions and a
    shortage of arable land hamper long-term growth in agriculture, the leading
    economic sector. In 1991, deficient rainfall, stagnant export volume, and
    sagging export prices held economic growth below the all-important
    population growth figure.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $9.7 billion, per capita $385 (1989 est.); real
    growth rate 2.3% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    14.3% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    NA%, but there is a high level of unemployment and underemployment
Budget:
    revenues $2.4 billion; expenditures $2.8 billion, including capital
