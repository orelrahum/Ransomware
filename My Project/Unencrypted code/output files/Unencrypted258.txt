:Costa Rica Economy

Overview:
    In 1991 the economy grew at an estimated 2.5%, down somewhat from the 3.6%
    gain of 1990 and below the strong 5.5% gain of 1989. Increases in
    agricultural production (on the strength of good coffee and banana crops)

    deficit of $270 million was substantially below the 1990 deficit of $677
    million. Unemployment is officially reported at 4.6%, but much
    underemployment remains. External debt, on a per capita basis, is among the
    world's highest.
