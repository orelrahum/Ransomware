:Benin Economy

Overview:
    Benin is one of the least developed countries in the world because of
    limited natural resources and a poorly developed infrastructure. Agriculture
    accounts for about 35% of GDP, employs about 60% of the labor force, and
    generates a major share of foreign exchange earnings. The industrial sector
    contributes only about 15% to GDP and employs 2% of the work force. Low
    prices in recent years have kept down hard currency earnings from Benin's
    major exports of agricultural products and crude oil.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $2.0 billion, per capita $410; real growth rate
    3% (1991)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    3.0% (1990)
Unemployment rate:
    NA%
Budget:
    revenues $194 million; expenditures $390 million, including capital
    expenditures of $104 million (1990 est.)
