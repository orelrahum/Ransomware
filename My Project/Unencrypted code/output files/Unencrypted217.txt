:Bosnia and Herzegovina Economy

Overview:
    Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to Macedonia as the poorest component in
    the old Yugoslav federation. Although agriculture has been almost all in
    private hands, farms have been small and inefficient, and the republic
    traditionally has been a net importer of food. Industry has been greatly
    overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of Communist central planning
    and management. Tito had pushed the development of military industries in
    the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a large share of
    Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of April 1992, the newly independent
    republic was being torn apart by bitter interethnic warfare that has caused
    production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar, and human misery
    to multiply. The survival of the republic as a political and economic unit
    is in doubt. Both Serbia and Croatia have imposed various economic blockades
    and may permanently take over large areas populated by fellow ethnic groups.
    These areas contain most of the industry. If a much smaller core Muslim
    state survives, it will share many Third World problems of poverty,
    technological backwardness, and dependence on historically soft foreign
    markets for its primary products. In these circumstances, other Muslim
    countries might offer assistance.

:Bosnia and Herzegovina Economy

Agriculture:
    accounted for 8.6% of national income in 1989; regularly produces less than
    50% of food needs; the foothills of northern Bosnia support orchards,
    vineyards, livestock, and some wheat and corn; long winters and heavy
    precipitation leach soil fertility reducing agricultural output in the
    mountains; farms are mostly privately held, small, and not very productive
