:Taiwan Economy

Overview:
    Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable government
    guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial government ownership of
    some large banks and industrial firms. Real growth in GNP has averaged about
    9% a year during the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster
    and has provided the impetus for industrialization. Agriculture contributes
    about 4% to GNP, down from 35% in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13
    among major trading countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are
    steadily being replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive
    industries. Taiwan has become a major investor in China, Thailand,
    Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia. The tightening of labor markets
    has led to an influx of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.
