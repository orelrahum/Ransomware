:Venezuela Economy

Overview:
    Petroleum is the cornerstone of the economy and accounted for 23% of GDP,
    80% of central government revenues, and 80% of export earnings in 1991.
    President PEREZ introduced an economic readjustment program when he assumed
    office in February 1989. Lower tariffs and price supports, a free market
    exchange rate, and market-linked interest rates threw the economy into
    confusion, causing an 8% decline in GDP in 1989. However, the economy
    recovered part way in 1990, and grew by 9.2% in 1991, led by the petroleum
    sector.
