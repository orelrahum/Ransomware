:Sao Tome and Principe Economy

Overview:
    The economy has remained dependent on cocoa since the country gained
    independence nearly 15 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa production has
    gradually deteriorated because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 1987
    output had fallen to less than 50% of its former levels. As a result, a
    shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance-of-payments
    problem. Production of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm
    kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of
    exports by a ratio of 4:1. The emphasis on cocoa production at the expense
    of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of food needs.
    It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. Over the years,
    Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt, which amounts to
    roughly 80% of export earnings. Considerable potential exists for
    development of a tourist industry, and the government has taken steps to
    expand facilities in recent years. The government also implemented a
    Five-Year Plan covering 1986-90 to restructure the economy and reschedule
    external debt service payments in cooperation with the International
    Development Association and Western lenders.
