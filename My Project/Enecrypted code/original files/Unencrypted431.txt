:Niger Economy

Overview:
    About 90% of the population is engaged in farming and stock raising,
    activities that generate almost half the national income. The economy also
    depends heavily on exploitation of large uranium deposits. Uranium
    production grew rapidly in the mid-1970s, but tapered off in the early 1980s
    when world prices declined. France is a major customer, while Germany,
    Japan, and Spain also make regular purchases. The depressed demand for
    uranium has contributed to an overall sluggishness in the economy, a severe
    trade imbalance, and a mounting external debt.
