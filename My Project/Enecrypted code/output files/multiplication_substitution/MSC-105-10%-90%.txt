Climate:
    tropical cyclones (hurricanes) develop off the coast of Africa near Cape
    Verde and move westward into the Caribbean Sea; hurricanes can occur from
    May to December, but are most frequent from August to November
Terrain:
    surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait, and
    Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise warm water gyre (broad, circular
    system of currents) in the north Atlantic, counterclockwise warm water gyre
    in the south Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Atlantic
    Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin;
    maximum depth is 8,605 meters in the Puerto Rico Trench
Natural resources:
    oil and gas fields, fish, marine mammals (seals and whales), sand and gravel
    aggregates, placer deposits, polymetallic nodules, precious stones

    Madeira Islands; icebergs from Antarctica occur in the extreme southern
    Atlantic
Note:
    ships subject to superstructure icing in extreme north Atlantic from October
    to May and extreme south Atlantic from May to October; persistent fog can be
