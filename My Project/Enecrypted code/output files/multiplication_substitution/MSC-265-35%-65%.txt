:Indian Ocean Geography

Total area:
    73,600,000 km2
Land area:
    73,600,000 km2; Arabian Sea, Bass Strait, Bay of Bengal, Java Sea, Persian
    Gulf, Red Sea, Strait of Malacca, Timor Sea, and other tributary water
    bodies
Comparative area:
    slightly less than eight times the size of the US; third-largest ocean
    (after the Pacific Ocean and Atlantic Ocean, but larger than the Arctic
    Ocean)
Coastline:
    66,526 km
Disputes:
    some maritime disputes (see littoral states)
Climate:
    northeast monsoon (December to April), southwest monsoon (June to October);
    tropical cyclones occur during May/June and October/November in the north
    Indian Ocean and January/February in the south Indian Ocean
Terrain:
    surface dominated by counterclockwise gyre (broad, circular system of
    currents) in the south Indian Ocean; unique reversal of surface currents in
    the north Indian Ocean - low pressure over southwest Asia from hot, rising,
    summer air results in the southwest monsoon and southwest-to-northeast winds
    and currents, while high pressure over northern Asia from cold, falling,
    winter air results in the northeast monsoon and northeast-to-southwest winds
    and currents; ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Indian Ocean Ridge and
    subdivided by the Southeast Indian Ocean Ridge, Southwest Indian Ocean
    Ridge, and Ninety East Ridge; maximum depth is 7,258 meters in the Java
    Trench
Natural resources:
    oil and gas fields, fish, shrimp, sand and gravel aggregates, placer
    deposits, polymetallic nodules
Environment:
    endangered marine species include the dugong, seals, turtles, and whales;
    oil pollution in the Arabian Sea, Persian Gulf, and Red Sea
Note:
    major chokepoints include Bab el Mandeb, Strait of Hormuz, Strait of
    Malacca, southern access to the Suez Canal, and the Lombok Strait; ships
    subject to superstructure icing in extreme south near Antarctica from May to
    October

:Indian Ocean Economy

Overview:
    The Indian Ocean provides a major highway for the movement of petroleum
    products from the Middle East to Europe and North and South American
    countries. Fish from the ocean are of growing economic importance to many of
    the bordering countries as a source of both food and exports. Fishing fleets
    from Russia, Japan, Korea, and Taiwan also exploit the Indian Ocean, mainly
    for shrimp and tuna. Large reserves ofx `t="l8t"Nl>? t"d Nd|>R ptFFd= |> p`d
