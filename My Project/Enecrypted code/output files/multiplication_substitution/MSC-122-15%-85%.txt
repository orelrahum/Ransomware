:Belgium Economy

Overview:
    This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its central
    geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified
    industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in the
    populous Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging
    reinvestment in the southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources
    Belgium must import essential raw materials, making its economy closely
    dependent on the state of world markets. Over 70% of trade is with other EC
    countries. During the period 1988-90, Belgium's economic performance was
    marked by 4% average growth, moderate inflation, and a substantial external
    surplus. Growth fell to 1.4% in 1991.
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $171.8 billion, per capita $17,300; real
    growth rate 1.4% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    3.2% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    9.4% est. (1991 est.)
Budget:
    revenues $45.0 billion; expenditures $55.3 billion, including capital
    expenditures of NA (1989)
Exports:
    $118 billion (f.o.b., 1990) Belgium-Luxembourg Economic Union
  commodities:
    iron and steel, transportation equipment, tractors, diamonds, petroleum
    products
  partners:
    EC 74%, US 5%, former Communist countries 2% (1989)
Imports:
