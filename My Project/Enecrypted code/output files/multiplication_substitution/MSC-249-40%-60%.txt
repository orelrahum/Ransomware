:Guinea-Bissau Economy

Overview:
    Guinea-Bissau ranks among the poorest countries in the world, with a per
    capita GDP below $200. Agriculture and fishing are the main economic
    activities. Cashew nuts, peanuts, and palm kernels are the primary exports.
    Exploitation of known mineral deposits is unlikely at present because of a
    weak infrastructure and the high cost of development. The government's
    four-year plan (1988-91) has targeted agricultural development as the top
    priority.

    5.0% (1989)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    25% (1990 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    NA%
Budget:
    revenues $22.7 million; expenditures $30.8 million, including capital
    expenditures of $18.0 million (1989 est.)
Exports:
    $14.2 million (f.o.b., 1989 est.)
  commodities:
    cashews, fish, peanuts, palm kernels
  partners:
