    May to December, but are most frequent from August to November
Terrain:
    surface usually covered with sea ice in Labrador Sea, Denmark Strait, and
    Baltic Sea from October to June; clockwise warm water gyre (broad, circular
    system of currents) in the north Atlantic, counterclockwise warm water gyre
    in the south Atlantic; the ocean floor is dominated by the Mid-Atlantic
    Ridge, a rugged north-south centerline for the entire Atlantic basin;
    maximum depth is 8,605 meters in the Puerto Rico Trench
