:Algeria Economy

Overview:
    The oil and natural gas sector forms the backbone of the economy. Algeria
    depends on hydrocarbons for nearly all of its export receipts, about 30% of
    government revenues, and nearly 25% of GDP. In 1973-74 the sharp increase in
    oil prices led to a booming economy and helped to finance an ambitious
    program of industrialization. Plunging oil and gas prices, combined with the
    mismanagement of Algeria's highly centralized economy, has brought the
    nation to its most serious social and economic crisis since independence in
    1988. The government has promised far-reaching reforms, including
    privatization of some public- sector companies, encouraging private-sector
    activity, boosting gas and nonhydrocarbon exports, and proposing a major
    overhaul of the banking and financial systems, but to date it has made only
    limited progress.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $54 billion, per capita $2,130; real growth rate
    2.5% (1990 est.)
