:Togo Economy

Overview:
    The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which accounts
    for about 35% of GDP and provides employment for 78% of the labor force.
    Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and cotton, which together
    account for about 30% of total export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in
    basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector
    phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, with phosphate
    exports accounting for about 40% of total foreign exchange earnings. Togo
    serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The government, over the
    past decade, with IMF and World Bank support, has been implementing a number
    of economic reform measures, that is, actively encouraging foreign
    investment and attempting to bring revenues in line with expenditures.
    Political unrest throughout 1991, however, has jeopardized the reform
    program and has disrupted vital economic activity.
