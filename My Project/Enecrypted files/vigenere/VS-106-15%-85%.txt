:Australia Economy

Overview:
    Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a per
    capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European countries.
    Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural
    products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Of the top 25 exports, 21 are
    primary products, so that, as happened during 1983-84, a downturn in world
    commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy. The government is
    pushing for increased exports of manufactured goods, but competition in
    international markets continues to be severe.
GDP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $280.8 billion, per capita $16,200; real
    growth rate --0.6% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    3.3% (September 1991)
Unemployment rate:
    10.5% (November 1991)
Budget:
    revenues $76.9 billion; expenditures $75.4 billion, including capital
    expenditures of NA (FY91)
Exports:
    $41.7 billion (f.o.b., FY91)
  commodities:
    metals, minerals, coal, wool, cereals, meat, manufacturers
  partners:
    Japan 26%, US 11%, NZ 6%, South Korea 4%, Singapore 4%, UK, Taiwan, Hong
    Kong
Imports:
    $37.8 billion (f.o.b., FY91)
  commodities:
    manufactured raw materials, capital equipment, consumer goods
  partners:
    US 24%, Japan 19%, UK 6%, FRG 7%, NZ 4% (1990)
External debt:
    $130.4 billion (June 1991)
Industrial production:
    growth rate --0.9% (1991); accounts for 32% of GDP
