:Swaziland Economy

Overview:
    The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which occupies most of the
    labor force and contributes nearly 25% to GDP. Manufacturing, which includes
    a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts for another quarter of GDP.
    Mining has declined in importance in recent years; high-grade iron ore
    deposits were depleted in 1978, and health concerns cut world demand for
    asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry products are the main earners of
    hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a short border with
    Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South Africa, from which it
    receives 75% of its imports and to which it sends about half of its exports.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $563 million, per capita $725; real growth rate
    5.0% (1990 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    13% (1990)
Unemployment rate:
    NA%
Budget:
    revenues $335.4 million; expenditures $360.5 million, including capital
    expenditures of $NA (FY93 est.)
