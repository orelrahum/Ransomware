:Chad Economy

Overview:
    The climate, geographic location, and lack of infrastructure and natural
    resources potential make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in
    the world. Its economy is burdened by the ravages of civil war, conflict
    with Libya, drought, and food shortages. In 1986 real GDP returned to its
    1977 level, with cotton, the major cash crop, accounting for 48% of exports.
    Over 80% of the work force is employed in subsistence farming and fishing.
    Industry is based almost entirely on the processing of agricultural
    products, including cotton, sugarcane, and cattle. Chad is highly dependent
    on foreign aid, with its economy in trouble and many regions suffering from
    shortages. Oil companies are exploring areas north of Lake Chad and in the
    Doba basin in the south. Since coming to power in December 1990, the Deby
    government has experienced a year of economic chaos.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $1.0 billion, per capita $205; real growth rate
    0.9% (1989 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    --4.9% (1989)
Unemployment rate:
    NA
Budget:
    entirely funded by outside donors
Exports:
    $174 million (f.o.b., 1990 est.)
  commodities:
    cotton 48%, cattle 35%, textiles 5%, fish
