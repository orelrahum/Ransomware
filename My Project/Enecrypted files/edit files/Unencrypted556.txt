:West Bank Header

Note:
    The war between Israel and the Arab states in June 1967 ended with Israel in
    control of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, the Sinai, and the Golan
    Heights. As stated in the 1978 Camp David Accords and reaffirmed by
    President Bush's post-Gulf crisis peace initiative, the final status of the
    West Bank and the Gaza Strip, their relationship with their neighbors, and a
    peace treaty between Israel and Jordan are to be negotiated among the
    concerned parties. Camp David further specifies that these negotiations will
    resolve the respective boundaries. Pending the completion of this process,
    it is US policy that the final status of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
    has yet to be determined. In the view of the US, the term West Bank
    describes all of the area west of the Jordan River under Jordanian
    administration before the 1967 Arab-Israeli war. However, with respect to
    negotiations envisaged in the framework agreement, it is US policy that a
    distinction must be made between Jerusalem and the rest of the West Bank
    because of the city's special status and circumstances. Therefore, a
    negotiated solution for the final status of Jerusalem could be different in
    character from that of the rest of the West Bank.
