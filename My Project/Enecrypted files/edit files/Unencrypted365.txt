:Korea, South Economy

Overview:
    The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth has been the planned
    development of an export-oriented economy in a vigorously entrepreneurial
    society. Real GNP has increased more than 10% annually over the past six
    years. This growth has led to an overheated situation characterized by a
    tight labor market, strong inflationary pressures, and a rapidly rising
    current account deficit. Policymakers have stated they will focus attention
    on slowing inflation. In any event, the economy will remain the envy of the
    great majority of the world's peoples.
GNP:
    purchasing power equivalent - $273 billion, per capita $6,300; real growth
    rate 8.7% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    9.7% (1991)
Unemployment rate:
    2.4% (1991)
Budget:
    revenues $44 billion; expenditures $44 billion, including capital
