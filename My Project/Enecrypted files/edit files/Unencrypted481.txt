:Saudi Arabia Economy

Overview:
    The petroleum sector accounts for roughly 70% of budget revenues, 37% of
    GDP, and almost all export earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves
    of petroleum in the world, ranks as the largest exporter of petroleum, and
    plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the government intends to
    encourage private economic activity and to foster the gradual process of
    turning Saudi Arabia into a modern industrial state that retains traditional
    Islamic values.
