:Zimbabwe Economy

Overview:
    Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and supplies almost 40%
    of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture and mining,
    produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP. Mining accounts for
    only 5% of both GDP and employment, but supplies of minerals and metals
    account for about 40% of exports. Wide year-to-year fluctuations in
    agricultural production over the past six years have resulted in an uneven
    growth rate, one that on average has matched the 3% annual increase in
    population. Helped by an IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program,
    output rose 3.5% in 1991. A drought beginning toward the end of 1991
    suggests rough going for 1992.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $7.1 billion, per capita $660; real growth rate
    3.5% (1991 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    25% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    at least 30% (1991 est.)
Budget:
    revenues $2.7 billion; expenditures $3.3 billion, including capital
    expenditures of $330 million (FY91)
Exports:
    $1.8 billion (f.o.b., 1991 est.)
  commodities:
    agricultural 35% (tobacco 20%, other 15%), manufactures 20%, gold 10%,
    ferrochrome 10%, cotton 5%J
