:Tuvalu Economy

Overview:
    Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor soil.
    The country has no known mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence
    farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. The islands are too
    small and too remote for development of a tourist industry. Government
    revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker
    remittances. Substantial income is received annually from an international
    trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, New Zealand, and the UK and
    supported also by Japan and South Korea.
GNP:
    exchange rate conversion - $4.6 million, per capita $530; real growth rate
    NA% (1989 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    3.9% (1984)
Unemployment rate:
    NA%
Budget:
    revenues $4.3 million; expenditures $4.3 million, including capital
    expenditures of $NA (1989)
Exports:
