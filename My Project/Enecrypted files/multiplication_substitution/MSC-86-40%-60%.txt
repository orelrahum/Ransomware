:Afghanistan Economy

Overview:
    Fundamentally, Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly
    dependent on farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and
    goats). Economic considerations, however, have played second fiddle to
    political and military upheavals during more than 13 years of war, including
    the nearly 10-year Soviet military occupation (which ended 15 February
    1989). Over the past decade, one-third of the population fled the country,
    with Pakistan sheltering more than 3 million refugees and Iran about 1.3
    million. Another 1 million probably moved into and around urban areas within
    Afghanistan. Although reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product
    is lower than 12 years ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the
    disruption of trade and transport.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $3 billion, per capita $200; real growth rate 0%
    (1989 est.)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    over 90% (1991 est.)
Unemployment rate:
    NA%
Budget:
    revenues NA; expenditures NA, including capital expenditures of NA
Exports:
    $236 million (f.o.b., F`8$d d?p?=
