:Malaysia Economy

Overview:
    During the period 1988-91 booming exports helped Malaysia continue to
    recover from the severe 1985-86 recession. Real output grew by 8.8% in 1989,
    10% in 1990, and 8.6% in 1991, helped by vigorous growth in manufacturing
    output, further increases in foreign direct investment - particularly from
    Japanese and Taiwanese firms facing higher costs at home - and increased oil
    production. Malaysia has become the world's third-largest producer of
    semiconductor devices (after the US and Japan) and the world's largest
    exporter of semiconductor devices. Inflation has remained low; unemployment
    has stood at 6% of the labor force; and the government has followed prudent
    fiscal/monetary policies. The country is not self-sufficient in food, and
    some of the rural population subsist at the poverty level. Malaysia's high
    export dependence leaves it vulnerable to a recession in the OECD countries
    or a fall in world commodity prices.
