    The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the US. An
    agreement for the years 1986 to 1992 entitles the islands to $228 million
    for capital development, government operations, and special programs.
    Another major source of income is the tourist industry, which employs about
    10% of the work force. Japanese tourists predominate. The agricultural
    sector is made up of cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts,
    breadfruit, tomatoes, and melons. Industry is small scale in nature - mostly
    handicrafts and fish processing.
