    republics. Agriculture is well developed, especially meat production, and
    provides a surplus for export. Only about one-fifth of the work force is in
    agriculture. The major share of the work force engages in manufacturing both
    capital and consumer goods based on raw materials and intermediate products
    from the other former Soviet republics. These manufactures are of high
    quality by ex-Soviet standards and are exported to the other republics.
    Estonia's mineral resources are limited to major deposits of shale oil (60%
    of old Soviet total) and phosphorites (400 million tons). Estonia has a
    large, relatively modern port and produces more than half of its own energy
    needs at highly polluting shale oil power plants. Like the other 14
    successor republics, Estonia is suffering through a difficult transitional
    period - between a collapsed command economic structure and a
    still-to-be-built market structure. It has advantages in the transition, not
    having suffered so long under the Soviet yoke and having better chances of
    developing profitable ties to the Nordic and West European countries.
