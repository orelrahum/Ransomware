:Trinidad and Tobago Economy

Overview:
    Trinidad and Tobago's petroleum-based economy began to emerge from a lengthy
    depression in 1990 and 1991. The economy fell sharply through most of the
    1980s, largely because of the decline in oil prices. This sector accounts
    for 80% of export earnings and more than 25% of GDP. The government, in
    response to the oil revenue loss, pursued a series of austerity measures
    that pushed the unemployment rate as high as 22% in 1988. The economy showed
    signs of recovery in 1990, however, helped along by rising oil prices.
    Agriculture employs only about 11% of the labor force and produces about 3%
    of GDP. Since this sector is small, it has been unable to absorb the large
    numbers of the unemployed. The government currently seeks to diversify its
    export base.
GDP:
    exchange rate conversion - $4.9 billion, per capita $3,600; real growth rate
    0.7% (1990)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    11.1% (1990)
Unemployment rate:
    21% (1990)
Budget:
    revenues $1.5 billion; expenditures $1.7 billion, including capital
    expenditures of $150 million (1991 est.)
Exports:
    $2.0 billion (f.o.?N?" d$$>=
