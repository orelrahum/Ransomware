:Gibraltar Economy

Overview:
    The economy depends heavily on British defense expenditures, revenue from
    tourists, fees for services to shipping, and revenues from banking and
    finance activities. Because more than 70% of the economy is in the public
    sector, changes in government spending have a major impact on the level of
    employment. Construction workers are particularly affected when government
    expenditures are cut.
GNP:
    exchange rate conversion - $182 million, per capita $4,600; real growth rate
    5% (FY87)
Inflation rate (consumer prices):
    3.6% (1988)
